		When adding a new feed the text &quot;Type in the URL of the Feed here&quot; is at the same position as the &quot;confirm&quot; and &quot;cancel&quot; which looks somekind of strange... Here is a screenshot: It's probably a known issue but I thought it would be better to report it incase it isn't.

		I always have the problem that I can't find the podcast that I have already downloaded when I am offline. Therefore I asked myself if it would be possible to add an option which would automatically add every downloaded Podcast to the queue?

		I am not able to listen to Podcasts in the ogg vorbis format, I can download them with AntennaPod and play them with my music player, but I can't directly play them with AntennaPod.

		I don't know if this is a bug or if this is planned but AntennaPod also displays me RSS Items which doesn't have a enclosure tag and because AntennaPod is a podcatcher I would prefer it if it would only display those items which actually have a enclosure tag.

		I am not so sure if this is a bug or if this is a feature but I think the back button in the top left corner should take me to the previous antennapod screen(even if this is some kind of a duplicated functionality because the android back button alreday does that kind of thing). For example if you select a podcast in the new screen and press the top left corner button it will take you to the screen which displays all podcasts of this specific podcast and not the previous screen(which was the new screen in this example).

		Could you add a .nomedia file to the directory where antennapod stores podcast images and podcasts by default? Because this will prevent the gallery from indexing podcast covers. Besides it will prevent music players from indexing podcasts, which is a usefull thing(at least I think so).

		Is wiould be great if AntennaPod would be available in languages other than English. It could be done using https://www.transifex.com/ for example. I'd volunteer to translate it to Russian.

		I have Novo7 Paladin tablet: http://www.ainovo.com/novo7paladin-specs.html and I don't see AntennaPod in Google Play on this device. At the same time other podcast managers (podkicker, doggcatcher) are available. Also, I downloaded and installed apk on this device and it works perfectly. Is there something in android manifest which could be the reason for this?

		Hi, in my eyes has your software the most potential to will the best podcast app on android market. :) Playlist Support (minimum Audio and Video Podcast playlist) podcast will delete after listen 2.a. mark podcast to hold on the phone &quot;cloud&quot; sync for multiple devices Video Playback (i can not test it on my phone during crashes) i hope you will bring much more tools on the app. regards, Thomas

		First of all: Let me thank you for this app, just what I was waiting for! However there is a small issue with two of my podcasts which might be somehow related to #14. Or maybe not. AntennaPod cannot find downloadable files in the following feeds: http://ulm.ccc.de/dev/radio/podcast-ogg.xml http://www.duden.de/feed/podcast In the latter case this might be a problem with the feed since SwallowCatcher cannot handle that one either. Thank you very much in advance for fixing this issue. proedie

		First of all, I want to thank you for making the best free podcatcher I have found to date. I think headset controls would make this app even better. Even as basic as just play/pause would be great. Also would there be a way to automatically clear the refresh/download notification or an option to not show them at all? Thanks

		First off, thank you for your work. I'm glad someone has put together a good open source podcast app to replace Google Listen. Now, on to the problem. When I add two feeds from the CBC no new entry is created for the second one, but podcasts for the second start appearing in the list for the first. The CBC seems to be keeping all their XML files in the same directory (and this may be the source of the problem). To reproduce this, add the following feed: &quot;http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/spark.xml&quot; For me it shows up correctly in the feeds tab Then add &quot;http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/writersandco.xml&quot; No new feed appears, but podcasts for the second feed start to appear in the list for the first. To me this seems to be incorrect behaviour. Perhaps the URL used for the first feed is being replaced with the second -- I can't tell from what I'm seeing. You can reverse the order of adding the feeds -- the first feed added appears, the second always gets &quot;added&quot; to the first. If either feed is on a different host (for example NPR) two separate feeds are created and seem to work correctly. Perhaps the problem is that both of these XML files contain the link to the same site: &quot;http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting&quot;, even though they are different and separate feeds. Thanks again. Tony

			<description>
		One of the annoyances I've had with trying out any new podcast app is that I have to manually re-type in the urls of all of the podcasts that I have already subscribed to in Google Listen. This is true of AntennaPod as well, because few of the podcasts I want are in the Miro guide. I suspect that I am not the only one with this issue. I also suspect (though I don't know) that Listen is the most widely used podcatcher on Android. Perhaps is would help adoption of the app if the user could easily import their existing podcast subscriptions in Listen. I know nothing of what is involved in implementing such a feature, or if it is even possible. I believe a similar feature exists in Firefox for Android, where bookmarks and cookies can be imported from &quot;Browser&quot;. Thanks for your attention Tony PS: None of this would be (as much of) an issue if I could get Firefox (or Browser) to subscribe to a podcast by simply tapping on the RSS link. Perhaps I'm just missing something obvious.

		A lot of times, speakers speak too slowly or too fast. It would be great to have a way to adjust playback speed, especially without a $5 third party library like all other podcatchers do.

		When i listen to a podcast i just listen, i don't look a the show notes. After i listened a episode completely the episode is removed from the play list. If i want to browse through the show notes i have to retrieve the episode in &quot;feeds&quot; → &quot;podcast name&quot; → &quot;list of episodes&quot;. I think a simply list which provides the last fifteen episodes which are completely listened would be a great time saver. BTW: The &quot;automatic delete&quot;-function should skip items of this list. Therewith it is easy to listen to something again. Hope my request is comprehensible :) Greetings lightonflux

		The new auto-delete-function works well, but is a bit to fast / rigorous. Wouldn't it be better that the user can configure how many episodes should be leave in the storage or how much space antennapod can use? In GUI: A simple config dialogue where the user can define something like: store 20 episode or 500 MB Hope my request is understandable ;) Greetings lightonflux

		I wonder if its possible to add an option in &quot;settings&quot; to &quot;clear notifications after completed&quot; or something to that effect. I understand they are needed while updating feeds and downloading episodes but it would be great to have them automatically go away when completed instead of having to manually clear them every time. Thank you

		When you play an episode from the play list which isn't the first or last, a &quot;bug&quot; appears when you finished one episode. Normally play lists are played from the top to the bottom, no matter where you start. but AntennaPod jumps to the first entry every time you finished an episode, no matter which item is played. How it should be: If an episode is listened, the next (means the under lying entry) episode should be played.

		In version 0.9.5.1 (from FDroid, if that matters), if you enable the &quot;Display only episodes&quot; checkbox and then try to download (directly from the list of episodes, either for a single podcast or on the &quot;New&quot; tab) an episode that comes after where a hidden non-episode would have been, you either get the wrong file or no option to download at all. It's as if it's ignoring the &quot;Display only episodes&quot; option when working out which file to download.

		For the feed at http://podcast.hr-online.de/lateline/podcast.xml the image is not loading. That's not a bug in AntennaPod, because the feed is broken (it contains image tags with empty urls in every single item), but maybe it would be possible to work around that by ignoring image tags that aren't direct children of a channel element.

		Some feeds give all their audio files the same name (e.g. http://rss.sciam.com/sciam/60-second-earth). This will lead to AntennaPod overwriting the existing audio file when a new episode is downloaded, so basically only one episode can be present at any time.

		This just occured to me. I had my sd-card mounted in read-only mode (don't ask why) and antennaPod crashed when removing an item. when i restarted the app, the item was indeed removed, but still visible in /sdcard/Android/data/... I think it would be easy enough if AntennaPod first tries to delete the file, then remove it from the database. That way it will crash before it removes the item from the db.

		I use Antennapod on two devices and on one of them, when I try to download a podcast episode, I receive the message &quot;An error occurred when trying to donwload the file: Failed to access the external storage&quot;. Also, when I update the episodes list, the download fails and I receive the message &quot;IO error: /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/de.danoeh.antennapod/files/cache/feed-CBN - Podcast - No Divã do Gikovate (Invalid argument)&quot; On the other device, this feed works without any problem. I've already tried to exclude the feed and delete this cache directory but It didn't help although It seems like some cache or temporary files problem... Is there any other directory I may clean or exclude to try to make this feed work ? Thank you, Regards, Renato.

		Sometimes the downloaded podcasts are forgotten. The download icon just disappears from the list. But in the download log it is still visible that the download was successful. If I look into the &quot;Android/data/de.danoeh.antennapod/files/media&quot; directory I can see that the file is there. I haven't found a way to reproduce this, but this problem happened at least on two different devices.

		As a user, I don't really think of &quot;new&quot; episodes as opposed to &quot;queued&quot; ones. I just want to know what new stuff there is to hear, and operate the app while giving it as little thought as possible. I would AntennaPod's interface to reflect this. I made a quick mockup that you can see here: As you see there's still a &quot;Feeds&quot; tab, but the &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Queued&quot; tabs are replaced by a single &quot;Episodes&quot; one. The episode being played is at the top of it, with some control buttons. Right below it are the episodes that have been downloaded and are ready to be listened. When the current episode ends, it goes to the History and is replaced by the first item in the list. Old, listened items are removed automatically and make room for new ones to be downloaded (also automatically) and added to the list. This way, supposing I have already subscribed to a selection of feeds that I like, I can keep listening to new episodes without ever worrying to check for new episodes, or having to download newer ones or reorder the list, or even ever leaving the &quot;Episodes&quot; screen. As a user, I would only have to press &quot;Play&quot; to start listening and &quot;Pause&quot; to stop, and no further action would ever be required from me.

If you use multiple devices, you can synchronize subscriptions and your listening progress. it would be great if antennaPod can make use of this to import but even better sync the podcasts and listning postion between Antennapod instances (phone,tablet,goog TV etc) thx alot z

		Hi! Building AntennaPod with Maven works great! Now, if I want to fork it to build my own customized version, I'd love to do that with an IDE. But whether I choose IntelliJ or Eclipse, I run into configuration issues. Can you give me a hint on what to do if starting development in AntennaPod with an IDE? Would be great! Thanks! PS: this is not really an issue, I know, but I found no other way of contacting you. If you like, please send me an email to toby(at)isolation.de, I'd love to discuss my ideas with you. Cheers, Toby

		One feature that present in some podcast players, e.g. DoubleTwist, PocketCasts, etc., that I miss in AntennaPod is Forward and Backward Buttons, i.e. a button that skips ahead 30 seconds and one that skips behind 10 seconds. In regards to the interface, I think PocketCasts actually nailed it by making the buttons large overlays on the image art. Clicking to the right of the image art skips ahead 30 seconds. Clicking to the left of the image art skips behind 10 seconds. It makes it much easier to use the buttons blindly.

		EscapePod has recently updated their feeds to use gzip encoding on the feed results. http://feeds.escapeartists.net/EscapePod Looking at the results that come back thru the browser using Fiddler (http tracer) I see that the orginal URL redirects (302) to http://escapepod.org/feed/rss2 which redirects (301) to http://escapepod.org/feed/ all of these have HTTP header of Content-Encoding: gzip. Looking at the downloaded feed in the cache directory I can see that the feed is still gzipped rather than unzipped to plain text. Antenapod throws a &quot;Download failed Unsupported Feed type: Invalid type&quot; Let me know of you want HTTP tracings or the gzipped feeds. Regards Stuart

		Let me start off by saying thank you for producing high quality open source software and sharing it with everyone. I have been wanting to mess with android app development for a while, and I have started hacking at your code to understand how things work. Anyways, I've been playing around with the Google Reader API in the hopes of adding (some level of) google reader functionality to AntennaPod. At the very least it would be trivial to get an OAuth2 token from Android and then access the OMPL for a particular label directly from google reader as an import option (I've already gotten this level of functionality working in a dummy app). This would be way easier than the current OMPL import functionality and would only require one extra permission (USE_CREDENTIALS or something). Taking the idea further, one could imagine using google reader as a full on sync target for all feeds and read/unread statuses. This isn't so much a feature request as a request to gauge interest. If there is interest in such a feature (I know that Issue #21 is sort of a request in this direction) and no one is working on it, I'd like to contribute. If not, I can just try to develop the changes in a fork that I'll use myself and won't submit to Google Play.

		If I've been listening to a podcast and then pause it, sometimes at some point several minutes (or even hours) later AntennaPod will start playing the podcast all on its own. This isn't just pocket activation, it happens when it's sitting on my desk, or when I'm using it in the car. The usual situation is that I've been listening in the car or on headphones, I'll pause the playback, and then it will spontaneously start again a while later. This seems to happen regardless of whether something was plugged into the headphone jack during playback and both when playback has been paused normally and when it's been paused because the audio cable was unplugged. This happens in 0.9.6.4, and in the previous version. Please let me know what I can do to help via logs, etc. Sadly, I can't figure out how to reproduce the behavior, but it happens several times a week. I'm experiencing this issue on my Tmo Galaxy S3 running Cyanogenmod 10.0.0-d2tmo (Android 4.1.2).

		Playback can already be paused when the headphones are disconnected. It would be great if playback could be resumed when the headphones are plugged in again. I loved this feature on ACast: when somebody starts to talk, I just disconnect the headphones directly in my jacket's pocket, and when they're done, I just push the jack back in, and playback resumes. With AntennaPod I can do the disconnecting to stop, but to restart the podcast I need to get my phone out, unlock it, and click on the play button. Even less handy when I'm on my bike ;)

		I'd like to request an &quot;Auto-dequeue&quot; option, please, that automatically removes an episode from the queue once it has completed playing. This is different from the &quot;Auto-delete&quot; option in that the episode shouldn't be deleted from my cache when it is dequeued. Keep it in the cache in case I want to listen/view it again. Only delete it from cache at a later cache-expiration period, such as 7 days.

			<url>https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/116</url>
			<description>
		I don't think I have ever fully grasped what a &quot;New&quot; episode is. I guess it's new because it's been added recently? How recently? When does a new episode stop being new? Do I need to listen to it for it to become old, or does it automatically after some time? This suggestion is kind of related to #79 in that new and old episodes are added to the same list. The suggestion is to do away with the concept of &quot;New&quot; episodes and replace it with a concept much easier to grasp: &quot;Downloaded&quot; vs. &quot;Undownloaded&quot; episodes. The idea is that you have only one queue, and all new episodes are added to the bottom of that queue. The ones at the top are downloaded automatically when you have a WiFi connection, and then deleted after you listen to them in order to make room for new ones. That way you always have fresh new episodes ready to be listened without having to use 3G data, and you never have to worry about which ones you download because the application takes care of that by itself. Why separate downloaded episodes from undownloaded ones, then, if it's just one list? To let you know which ones you can listen to without using your data connection. That way, if there is one episode that attracts you in the &quot;Undownloaded&quot; section you can download it while you're at home, which will add it to &quot;Downloaded&quot; and let you listen to it on the go.

			<description>
		This suggestion is related to #79 and #116 because it uses a single queue and doesn't distinguish between new and old episodes, but downloaded and undownloaded. I think that switching to a card interface would make the queue look cleaner and make it easier to delete unwanted episodes: As you see, each episode is separated from the rest and all the relevant data appears in a clean way: you can see the episode's title and channel, as well as duration and progress (except for undownloaded episodes, which show their size instead). Similarly to #79, the episode being played is shown at the top of the queue. Its card is a bit bigger than the rest and shows some extra data. It also has a bigger proggress bar that lets you scroll through the episode. As specified in #116 all new episodes are added to the bottom of the &quot;Undownloaded&quot; list. As you listen to the ones at the top they get deleted, making room, and the ones at the top of &quot;Undownloaded&quot; are downloaded and moved to the bottom of the &quot;Downloaded&quot; list, so that you know that you can listen to them without using any mobile data. You can browse through the whole list and if any particular episodes don't attract you you can simply swipe them away and make room for new ones, which is one of the main benefits of the card interface. If you're browsing through the Undownloaded episodes and you see one that you like you can long-press it and choose to &quot;Play&quot; it (which moves it to the top of the Downloaded list and starts playing it right away) or &quot;Download&quot; it (which moves it to the bottom of the Downloaded list).

			<description>
		This issue is related to #116 because it implies the workflow suggested there. When you long-press an episode you get a lot of options that could be simplified: In that screenshot: &quot;Remove&quot; deletes the file but leaves the episode in the playing queue. &quot;Remove from queue&quot; returns the file to the waiting list, but keeps the file in the phone. If #116 is implemented neither of the above would make sense because being in the queue imply being downloaded, and the other way around. But we do need: A &quot;Remove&quot; option that completely deletes the file and makes the app forget about the episode. This should apply to items in the queue, waiting list or history. Also, in addition to a long-press action this could be triggered by swiping the episode away. An &quot;Add to queue&quot; option that takes items from the waiting list or the history and adds them to the bottom of the playing queue. Also, of course, sets them to be downloaded ASAP. Optionally some &quot;Return to waiting list&quot; and &quot;Move to history&quot; options for items in the queue. I don't think I would want these, though: once you move an episode to the queue you probably won't want to move it back unless you've lost your interest and don't want to listen to it anymore, in which case it would be simpler to just swipe it away and be done with it. &quot;Mark as read&quot; removes the &quot;new&quot; banner. &quot;Mark as unread&quot; adds it again. I find these largely irrelevant and, unless I've misunderstood their function, I don't think they're worth two slots in the long-press menu. Therefore, if you long-press an item in the playing queue I think that you should get these options: Play, which moves the episode to the top and starts playing it. Remove, already explained. And if you long-press an item in the waiting list or history you should get: Play. Remove. Add to playing queue, which adds it to the bottom of the queue. In addition to that, It could be useful to show these options as buttons on the bottom bar so that you can apply them to several items at once. Here's a quick mockup: As you see the mockup shows several selected items and three buttons at the bottom bar, which correspond to Play, Remove and Add to queue.

		If #116 is implemented there won't be any need for a Downloads screen. It will be easy to spot episodes being downloaded, because they will always be either in the playing queue or in the top spots of the waiting list. If you give them a &quot;downloading&quot; icon and a download progress bar (similar to the progress bar in half-listened items) seeing what downloads are taking place will be so simple right on the main screen that Downloads will be able to be removed, thus simplifying the interface and without losing anything.

			<description>
		Several issues suggest using auto-download. In order to have that we need the app to do the following: Devote some of the phone's memory to store podcasts when they are added to the playing queue. Erase already listened episodes in order to make room for new ones. This brings two problems: There needs to be a way to decide how much space is given. Episodes shouldn't be erased IMMEDIATELY after being listened, because if you like an episode and want to listen to it again you would have to use additional data. As a result, there needs to be a way to decide how much space is given to listened episodes. Therefore, two settings are needed: Disk space for cached episodes (by default: 10%). Disk space for listened episodes (by default: 5%). If you had a phone with 8GB memory AntennaPod would automatically download and enqueue new episodes until they reached 800MB, at which point it would stop. Additionally, listened episodes would be kept until they reached 400MB, at which point the older ones would be deleted from the memory. A user with a lower-end phone but really into podcasts could use those settings in order to devote more space.

		Here's a couple mockups of AntennaPod if it used a dropdown to move between sections instead of tabs: I have several reasons to think that this would be better than we have now: First, it would save space. Once you have subscribed to the desired podcasts (and once auto-download and auto-enqueue are implemented) the user shouldn't really have a lot of reasons to switch between sections. He will probably spend most of the time in the Episodes section, so I think that the saved space will become more important than being able to change sections quickly. Second, it would allow to move the History section into the dropdown. Which, being a section and not an action, I think would make more sense than having it inside the overflow menu. Third and most important, it would allow to swipe episodes away. Unwanted episodes could be dismissed very quickly, with the flick of a finger. Which will become very important once new episodes are added automatically to the waiting list. It's important to note that swiping away is impossible with the current approach because horizontal movement just changes sections.

		This suggestion is included in a couple other issues (e.g. #125) but I think it's worth having its own issue. Now that episodes are added to the waiting list and the playing queue automatically, we need an easy way to dismiss the ones that don't interest us. Swiping away is the quickest and handiest way, and the one many Google apps (e.g. Gmail) are favouring: The user would just have to flick their finger to the left or right, and the episode is dismissed. Unlistened episodes (that is, those the user never even started listening) would be deleted and forgotten, and listened ones (even partially listened ones) would be skipped and go to the History. It could even be used at the top of the queue (that is, on the current episode) to skip the current episode and start listening to the next one, which would be an easy way to implement Skip without having to use extra buttons or UI elements.

		Right now the Overflow menu has two different entries for History-related items: &quot;Playback History&quot; and &quot;Downloads&quot; The menu could be freed up if they were shown as tabs inside a &quot;History&quot; section, which would only take one slot in the menu. Additionally, it would make sense to show that item in a dropdown instead of the Overflow menu, which is shown in issue #125. That way it wouldn't even clutter Overflow at all.

		In the new test version of AntennaPod all enqueued items are downloaded automatically, but they don't show a progress bar until you start listening to them: They also show the word &quot;Length&quot; before they play time, but the ones you have started listening don't. I'm not sure whether or not this is intentional, but it looks like a UI inconsistency to me.

		I have been trying the test version for a couple days and it seems to check for new episodes, add them to the queue and download them automatically alright when I press the Refresh button. The only problem I see is that I have to press the button. The idea behind making everything automatic is that the user can add the podcasts he wants and forget about AntennaPod, and the app will still do its thing and serve him new episodes in a silver plate. To manage that the app shouldn't wait until the user opens it and presses Refresh. It should keep working in the background, checking for new episodes every so often (Daily? When the phone is charging and on WiFi?) and if it finds them, enqueue and download them automatically. And of course then let the user know, which is issue #122.

		The podcast &quot;En Flux Libre&quot;[1] cannot be used through AntennaPod, although they do have the OGG files directly linked into the RSS[2]. Home page: http://www.enfluxlibre.org/ RSS: http://www.enfluxlibre.org/?q=rss.xml It would be nice if AntennaPod could retrieve all/any audio file linked and use them as the actual podcast(s).

		When using Chrome as the default Android browser, the Flattr authorization does not work. After pressing the &quot;Authentifizieren&quot; button in Antennapod, Chrome is opened with the correct Flattr page to allow the app access to the Flattr account. However, after entering the credentials, the page redirects to an flattr4j://de.danoeh... URL, which Chrome seemingly can't handle, resulting in an error 302 (net::ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME).

		If you visit an unqueued, undownloaded episode and click Stream, the episode starts playing and is moved to the top of the queue. But this doesn't happen with the Download and Enqueue actions. If you click Download, the app downloads it but it doesn't add it to the bottom of the queue. If you click Enqueue, the app is added to the bottom of the queue but it isn't downloaded. Downloading an episode should always mean its getting added to the queue (and vice versa if you're on a WiFi) so these two buttons should be merge into a single Enqueue button.

		I have installed AntennaPod on a 9&quot; tablet with Full HD resolution. The default UI blows application icons to about 1/4 of the tablet hight. That is about 256x256px... The present icon scaled to this size looks awful. I would suggest including a few larger bitmaps or SVG of the original (if Anroid understands SVG icons, of course).

		I love having the new auto-download feature, but I find that the auto-enqueuing of auto-downloaded podcasts is a bit too aggressive. I like being able to create a playlist from the available podcasts. While I might be interested in a podcast in general, certain episodes may not strike my fancy, and I like being able to leave them out of the playlist. But with the new auto-downloading, I don't seem to have that ability. I had only used AntennaPod for a few days before this update, but I remember there being a setting to enqueue podcasts when they were downloaded. This allowed me to see a list of available podcasts in the &quot;Waiting List&quot; section, and then add specific ones of them to the &quot;Queue&quot; section as they interested me. I like auto-downloading, though, so what seems ideal to me is for podcasts to be auto-downloaded into the &quot;Waiting List,&quot; but allow for manual enqueuing -- possibly by returning the option to enable/disable enqueuing downloaded podcasts. I hope that makes sense. I really think AntennaPod is great! Thanks for all your hard work.

		Hey, since I (and I guess most of the people) just download and update their feeds on wifi, the submenus Playlist and Queue under Episodes is obsolete since queue is just used for the few seconds it needs to download the podcasts. So I suggest to have an and option in the settings menu to hide the categorys. Im not sure if someone needs it at all.

		HI, I find there is one feature missing, that would make AntennaPod perfect and I believe it would be very easy to implement. An option to either globally or on a per feed level to set: to keep only the last X episodes (e.g. keep only last 3 episodes and auto-delete older ones) to delete episodes older than X days (e.g. clean out old ones after 7 days, 30 days, etc) to keep all episodes (as it does now) BeyondPod has this feature implemented, so have all PC-based podcatchers I have ever used (e.g. gpodder). With that implemented, one could run AntennaPod in fire-and-forget mode, without having to take care of deleting old content manually.

		I have written a small example podcast search that could be added onto the AntennaPod app if you would like. It easily allows users to search by topic and return a basic list of podcasts and url to add to their list, this is much easier than trying to get them from the web and type in a URL, and would be a great boon to new users especially, and the less tech savy.

		This issue is related to #135. A small reordering of the Network settings could make them clearer and avoid unwanted 3G usage. I think the Network settings should be as follows: AUTOMATIC UPDATE Both on WiFi and 3G. Only on WiFi. Never update automatically (selected by default). UPDATE INTERVAL (greyed out if automatic update is enabled) 1 hour / 2 hours / 4 hours / 8 hours / 12 hours / 24 hours. AUTOMATIC DOWNLOADING OF ENQUEUED EPISODES Both on WiFi and 3G. Only on WiFi (selected by default). Never download enqueued episodes automatically. AUTOMATIC STREAMING OF ENQUEUED EPISODES Checkbox: stream on 3G if it's their turn to play (unchecked by default). EPISODE CACHE 10 episodes / 20 episodes / 40 episodes / 60 episodes / 80 episodes / 100 episodes. WiFi FILTER Checkbox: treat unselected networks as if they were 3G. Checkboxes: list of known networks. There are several advantages to this: Data usage can be set more easily because you can set what the app can or cannot do while on 3G (and on WiFi) in a single field, without the need for an extra checkbox (as opposed to the &quot;mobile updates&quot; checkbox in the current version). All related options are together, and unrelated ones are separate: the automatic update setting is next to the update interval, but far from the WiFi filter (because the latter affects several other things). Last but not least, the &quot;Automatic streaming of enqueued episodes&quot; checkbox allows us to have a single action instead of the highly overlapping &quot;Download&quot; and &quot;Enqueue&quot;, which is covered in #135.

		Certain users (e.g. those in issues #132 and #158) are reporting that they like to listen to shorter episodes first, or those from specific podcasts, or to newer ones. It could be useful to have an option in the queue menu to reorder the queue according to any of these criteria, either automatically or on demand.

		I currently have 352 episodes in waiting list, which i must decide individually to discard or to enqueue. I usually enter full description of the episode, then decide what to do, then go back. This process could be enhanced with some ideas: Have an optional expanded waiting list view, in which each episode includes its full description. When you are on the waiting episode view, have a gesture (eg: swipe left/right) to quick switch to next/prev element in the wating list, so you don't have to go back and select the next candidate. Have &quot;add to queue&quot; and &quot;mark as listened&quot; buttons embedded instead of through a menu. Allow to perform those operations (add to queue/mark as listened) with gestures.

		Using the dark theme, the app will often first start or re-start with the bright theme and then, after a brief delay, switch dark. This is a bit irritating. (I don't know if this a limitation of Android or if the app is setting the theme too late.)

		AntennaPod restarts the reading from the beginning when I unlock my phone. Here is how to reproduce: With the file manager, browse to a mp3 file. Mine are around 15 to 25MB for half an hour. Tap a file, open it with AntennaPod. Lock the phone (or wait for it to automatically lock) Unlock the phone AntennaPod goes back to start of the file. I use AntennaPod 0.9.7.3 on Android 4.1.2, but it was the same with 0.9.7.2.

		I recently migrated from PodKicker to AntennaPod and imported via OPML my subscriptions. Sadly all episodes were marked as old. I have audio books from librivox.org which haven't listened to yet, or listened only to a few chapters, so marking them as new is really difficult. I think, as proposed in another issue, marking as new and queuing should be directly accessible, instead of through a menu. Also a select all/deselect all would be useful, coupled with 'mark selected as new' or 'queue selected'.

		Hi, I'm using a Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.2.2, and the lockscreen widget has this strange behaviour. When I pause with the screen locked, the widget becomes large and starts to flicker. The two attached images show the problem: If the widget is already large, it flicks anyway. When I try to slide left or right to see another widget or camera, the camera preview and the other widget start to flickr also. I don't know exactly if this problem is in your code, but the Google Play Music doesn't change at all on any interaction.

		I would expect episodes on the waiting list to be shown chronologically, most recent first. But what I find is a dozen &quot;science friday&quot; episodes are always at the top of the list. That is, all the science friday episodes appear before anything else, even when any else is more recent. I would include the science friday podcast url in this issue, as I imagine that makes it easier to reproduce. however in antennapod I can't locate that information. When I go to Podcasts &gt;&gt; Science Friday &gt;&gt; Show information, the info shown does not include the URL.

		To reproduce: Add a podcast to the queue. Select the play button on top Listen carefully and you can hear it starts twice. The first time it starts it gets cut off after a millisecond. This only seems to happen for items in the queue, and only the first time it's selected. However, if you remove it from the queue, and readd it, the same thing happens.

		I had several hundred podcasts (downloaded files) on my 32Gb SD card. When I upgraded from v0.9.7 to v0.9.7.3, most of those files disappeared. Some of those I cannot re-download, because they come from feeds that make files available for only a short period of time (some BBC feeds, NHK, etc.). From what I could read in other issues, it seems that this might not be a bug but a feature. Can you confirm this? Is there a way to preserve files forever and only delete manually? In any case, it would have been nice if the user had been informed of such a behavior change, one that erases user files... I have been greatly pleased using AntennaPod, it has been very comfortable to use and works (almost) flawlessly, so it came as a shock when my files disappeared. :-(

		When operating a phone with a single hand, the organise queue operation can lead to accidental dragging of episodes sideways, which means eliminating the episode from the queue. Since there is no working confirmation of the changes (the check button is even eliminated in the test version @danieloeh sent me - 0.9.7.3+), there is no easy way to undo the operation.

		The Atom specification permits multiple files - one possible use for this is to do away with separate feeds for each podcast media format and include all available formats in a single feed. In this case, AntennaPod appears to simply download whatever format (that is recognized) is last in the list. I created a test &quot;feed&quot; (valid single-entry atom xml file) with the media enclosures in the same format order I use for HTML5 audio tags (i.e. preferred first). When the legacy mp3 format is last in the list, AntennaPod downloads the mp3 (skipping over the Ogg Vorbis version and the two other formats that it presumably doesn't recognize [opus and speex]). If I move the Ogg Vorbis version to the end of the list, the .ogg file is downloaded instead. Short term: I would have expected it to instead default to the FIRST one (on the assumption that the &quot;preferred&quot; formats would be put first in the feed by the feed author, the same way users of the HTML5 tag do). Long term (feature request): some sort of selection interface allowing download of any or all enclosures in at Atom entry (in addition to different formats of the same podcast media, multiple enclosures might also include &quot;supporting media&quot; such as diagram images, &quot;show notes&quot; text or pdf files, audio in different spoken languages, etc.) The static single-entry Atom &quot;feed&quot; that I'm using for testing currently may be found here: http://blinky.dogphilosophy.net/atomtest.xml

		When in the downloads screen or the player screen the back button in the upper left corner will always go to the Podcasts tab, which is really annoying and useless since I use that screen very seldom. Also this makes the button misleading since it suggests is a back button, but it isn't. A smarter thing would be to remember which was the tab from which that screen was opened and go to that tab. No long undo history is necessary, the last seen tab would be enough.

		Hey, my Wifi is quite unstable, so when I download a file sometimes the downloaded .mp3 seems to be corrupt. But it doesn't get deleted and it plays without problems, but the Podcasts just stops playing after some time and is marked as read then. I checked the file sized and its acutally smaller than it should be. So I want to suggest the feature to let the downloadmanager check the filesizes of the downloaded mp3 and redownload it if the size differs from the expected one.

		It would be great to let AntennaPOD display PDF files. Either internally or externally... I already parsed the source code and it seems easy to introduce a new media type, but I'm actually unable to introduce some external viewer to the app. I am an experienced iOS dev. but very new to Android dev. Could someone help me find the trick ? Or if it is easy to implement it ? Much better, why not let the user decide what app to launch on unknown media type ?

		Noticed this on listening to an episode from the Logbuch:Netzpolitik Ogg Vorbis feed (http://logbuch-netzpolitik.de/feed/oga) One would expect the famous &quot;Guten Morgen, Linus!&quot;. But instead the first 10 seconds of an episode are not played if the file is downloaded. Playback starts at 00:00:10. You can not skip to 00:00:00. Neither via the skip back button, nor via the slider bar or chapter marks. When the file is streamed, playback starts at the beginning and skipping is possible. This does not happen with M4A or MP3 files. I also checked with one other Ogg Vorbis podcast, although produced with the same toolchain. It is reproducible. http://www.staatsbuergerkunde-podcast.de/feed/ogg-rss/

		I tried to play a .m4a file from the file manager using antennapod as the audio player, which did not work. It turned out that the .m4a file was corrupt, the download stopped at 95%. Now antennapod always crashes right after starting the program. I removed the corrupt file, I also put the valid file at the same location as the corrupt file, still no chance. Deleting antennapod and all data helps, but I lose all my subscriptions and progress info. When I restore from a backup (done right before deleting antennapod to fix the problem) I see in the background that all subscriptions are there, but then the program crashes :-( I sent a bug report using the built-in crash handler, maybe you have received it? Regards, and thanks for this beautiful app! Thomas

		I think it would be great, if the sleep-timer wouldn't just stop playing, it should fade out. And it happens, that the sleep-timer stops the podcast but I'm not sleeping yet. Therefor there should be something like the Snooze-function from alarm-clocks just inverted. I'm thinking of this: The sleep-timer starts fading out and I'm pressing a button (the hardware volume buttons would be predestined) and the volume is faded in to the former level and the sleep timer is set for 15 minutes (e.g.).

		Here is a way to crash AntennaPod 100% of the time: From the file manager, open an mp3 file with AntennaPod, start reading. Quit AP (completely, either by killing the process or by rebooting the device). Move the file Try to start AP: it will crashes 100% of the time. One workaround is to put back the file, but it may not be possible in some cases. Example: someone gives you a SD card, you listen to some music or podcast. Then you turn off the phone to give back the SD card, when you start AP again you have no way to prevent it from crashing. Tested on my smartphone with Android 4.1.2.

		I've got a bunch of downloaded audio files on my phone's SD card: podcast episodes that are not available in their feeds anymore. It would be great to be able to create a &quot;feed&quot; by pointing AntennaPod to that specific folder on the SD card. (Sorry if this is a duplicate, can't seem to find the search function anymore on GitHub, likely fallout from when the GH issues search was &quot;leaking&quot; passwords?)

		I have used Google Listen from when I got my Android phone to when the Google Reader service was discontinued. I tried BeyondPod and AntennaPod before the service ended and decided to stick with AntennaPod. They are both good, but one is free and open source :) The only feature I really miss now that I am using AntennaPod is that Google Listen would pause and resume playback during voice navigation. I think this would be a great convenience feature to add. I am willing to make a donation.

			<description>
		Yesterday evening AntennaPod crashed during a manual feed update and when I went back in everything was gone! &quot;You haven't subscribed to any feeds yet&quot;. Opening a file manager, I see that Android/data/de.danoeh.antennapod/ still looks good (so I made a copy of it!). The files/media/ directories still contain podcasts that I have downloaded, and the files/cache/ directories still contain all the feed-* files. Is there a way in which I can get AntennaPod to recreate the settings, etc, or should I just go ahead and add everything back in manually? Where are the settings files stored that tell AntennaPod what I'm subscribed to, etc? I have Update interval set to Manual, and I manually update feeds several times a day. Every couple of days or so, the app crashes during an update, usually if I try to do other operations within the app at the same time. I just go back in and retry and all is fine. Thanks! -Ross

		I noticed that automatic feed refreshes for the ~ 50 feeds I subscribed to can take up to around 20 minutes when the device is asleep, in contrast to less than a minute when the device is awake. This is happening because AntennaPod fails to hold a WakeLock while it is refreshing feeds or downloading media files. As a consequence, after the FeedUpdateReceiver's onReceive() method returns, the device will go back to sleep, although the actual downloads are still pending.

		AntennaPod downloads episodes even if not enough space is on the device. So it downloads a episode of 100MB and then says &quot;oh sorry not enought space left on device&quot;. That's not funny if you only have some 100MB or 1GB of full speed mobile internet and then the bandwith drops to unusable for AntennaPods download mechanism. Why doesn't AP checks if enough space is left before downloading a whole episode? I know there are some cases where you don't know how big the file will be, but in most cases it not a problem.

		AntennaPod &quot;forgets&quot; the already downloaded files within a very short time no matter if the episodes are downloaded manually or by the automatic download function (which is working for me btw). What happens: Download progress is looking good. After successful downloading there is an indication (arrow down) the files are stored locally and I can play them offline. Fine. But after closing and restarting the app most of the time (not always) the little indication is gone and AntennaPod is offering the download option again. That's wrong. It's more annoying if one is using the automatic download function. The podcast episodes are downloaded over and over again until the sd-card is full(?). After 60 minutes I had a lot of files like xxxxx-1.mp3 xxxxxx-2.mp3 xxxxxx-3.mp3 and so on... What am I using: AntennaPod 0.9.7.4 (from F-Droid repo) Android 4.2.2 Cyanogenmod 10.1.2 Path to podcasts: /storage/sdcard0/Podcasts/... Best regards, AlfredSK

		I went to export to OPML in order to migrate from the fdroid version to the Play version and didn't pay attention to where it saved the file. When I went to reinstall, the file was gone, as it was cleared with the app uninstall. It would be wonderful if it could be stored in a public place so fat fingers can't so easily wipe the backup. Maybe just on the root of the SD card or in the Downloads folder.

		Currently, when no podcast is playing, the widget shows a generic &quot;No media playing&quot; message. Clicking it, brings up the empty &quot;player page&quot;. If one wants to select a new episode to play, one has to click the app logo to get back to the podcast list and once more on &quot;EPISODES&quot;. Please make it possible to skip this procedure by making the widget load the episode list directly, when none is playing.

		Whenever I ask AntennaPod to download an episode, it force closes. The crashes used to only happen when downloading everything in my queue, but now it crashes even when I request an individual episode to be downloaded. If I increase the number of episodes allowed in my cache, I can then download specific episodes for a few days and then it starts force closing again. I suspect this is caused by two inter-related issues. When the episode cache is full, it force closes instead of cancelling the download and providing some intelligent message to the user It appears not clean up download episodes after listening to them. I recently cleared dozens of old episodes out of my media folder that were not deleted when I completed listening to them. I suspect that some counter was not cleared when I deleted the files, so the application still thinks I'm at my limit of cached episodes. AntennaPod 0.9.7.4 Nexus 4, Build JWR66V

		Feed Items which contain an Iframe are open in an external browser. They should probably be opened inline. The thing is that shouldOverrideUrlLoading() is called for iframes while loading the page, and not only when user clicks on a link. I am not sure about the workaround, but i think we should use a condition in handling of shouldOverrideUrlLoading(): While page is loading assume url is an iframe and load internally (return false). After page finished loading use current behaviour, load externally (do the intent and return true).

		A cool feature would be the ability to mark episodes as played in the podcast's list of episodes. You could turn the title text grey to signify that the episode has been listened to. I follow a lot of podcasts and it would be nice to see which I've finished listening to and which ones I haven't. I know that this functionality is sort of provided by having a queue, but just a suggestion. I used to use a Zune for podcasts and really liked how it managed them.

		Hello, Since yesterday, I can not sort episodes anymore. It used to work fine. Now, when trying to move an episode up or down: after following my finger, when I drop it where I wan it, the complete list flickers, then it goes back to its initial position. I am using AntennaPod 0.9.7.4 on Android 4.1.2 since a few months. What can I do, except uninstall / reinstall (and lose all my history) ? Could it be a missing right on a file somewhere, lost for an unknown reason? Thanks for your help.

		I'm trying to build AntennaPod to fix an issue, since it's such a great project and I want to contribute back. I'm having an issue compiling; I'm on Debian, and installed gradle by unzipping the gradle ZIP distribution from its website. I unzipped it into ~/gradle-1.7/ and got this error: androider@pathi:~/AntennaPod$ ~/gradle-1.7/bin/gradle assembleDebug

FAILURE: Could not determine which tasks to execute.

* What went wrong:
Task 'assembleDebug' not found in root project 'antennapod'.

* Try:
Run gradle tasks to get a list of available tasks.

BUILD FAILED

Total time: 3.84 secs
 I'm hoping to do the compile with gradle rather than eclipse, and it seems to me that this should work according to https://github.com/danieloeh/AntennaPod/wiki/Building-AntennaPod#building-on-the-command-line-with-gradle . If the issue is a documentation error, and you can describe what I need to do here, I am willing to fix the docs too if I can reproduce that the solution works for me, too. Let me know. Thanks!

		In the episode preview, there used to be a playback button (as seen in this old screenshot here: http://blog.znn.info/antennapod/20121116_224017/). Instead, there is now a playback item in the context menu as shown in the attached screenshot. Can we please have the button back?

		In Google TV 3.2 Logitech Revue on a 1080p TV, using AntennaPod 16:9 video has a significant black border on the bottom, left and right edges. The previous version properly scaled the video to full screen without any borders. I don't know if its not scaling the 16:9 720p source video is not scaling enough. I think it might be scaling it but just not to maximum resolution of the display. AntennaPod 0.9.7.5

		In Google TV 3.2 Logitech Revue, pressing the pause button on the device's remote does not pause the video. When the pause button is pressed on the device's remote, the video appears to re-buffer and then continues to play. (Pressing skip forward and skip back buttons on the remote do work properly however :D ) Pressing pause via the app's UI with a mouse press does properly pause the video's playback.

		Setting the number in &quot;Episode cache&quot; does not update until Setting menu gets closed and opened again. In 0.9.7.4 it worked as expected. Similar behaviour can be observed also within &quot;Automatic download&quot;: Setting the tick at &quot;Automatic download&quot; does not enable &quot;Enable Wi-Fi filter&quot;. To get &quot;Enable Wi-Fi filter accessible you need to exit from the &quot;Settings&quot; menu completely and choose &quot;Settings/Automatic download&quot; again.

		I am subscribed to 2 high-frequency podcasts (daily 07:00 and 19:00 radio news), which I only infrequently listen to: maybe once a week I'll manually download the latest episode. But those 2 feeds show up with 2 new episodes per day in the list of recent episodes, which to me only represent noise. I would appreciate a way to &quot;hide&quot; the episodes from these feeds in the list of new episodes. This would be a per-feed option, &quot;do not show new episodes in list&quot;. With such a feature, i could go to the Feed and download the latest episode, only when I want to listen to an episode. The rest of the time, those episodes don't fill up the newest episodes, and that list has more meaningful items in it ;)

		I've got a very memory-challenged phone, and am always trying to skim a few MB on the internal memory to be able to install new apps, but unfortunately AntennaPod can't be moved to the SD card. I believe this is done adding android:installLocation to the manifest file. I'd suggest using &quot;preferExternal&quot;, although &quot;auto&quot; (install by default on internal memory, on external if internal is already full)

		When the headphone are disconnected, AP stops playing. That's fine. However, as one has to unlock the phone to do anything with it, then AP restarts playing. This is a recent behavior, and should not happen, at least for this use case: using the headphone removal to stop playing, then moving on to something else. If it is not a bug but a recent feature, could it be optionnal? Thanks.

		I understand the rationale for not offering the ability to mark episodes as unread (although I don't agree with it...). But I don't think this rationale applies when you've added a new feed - in some cases, you'd probably need to start from episode 1 but you wouldn't necessarily want top add 200+ episodes to the queue. For example, many educational podcasts will need to be listened to in order, as later episodes will use concepts introduced earlier ones. In my case, I have a beginners Spanish podcast that I've started listening to with a few hundred episodes already recorded and tracking where I'm up to is already a bit of a pain. With this in mind, could we have an option when adding the feed to mark the entire feed unread?

		Since v0.7.5 (Google Play store build), I have the impression that episode details aren't viewable anymore, if downloads are running in parallel. The display stays blank for many seconds often, and sometimes the app also crashes (although that might be related to me running CM 10.2 nightlies). When no downloads are running, the episode details are displayes as quickly as expected. It would be great if downloading episode details could be prioritised over other downloads. Thanks and greetings!

		If I play pause button on my headphones when just connected to a wifi network it will actually pause or play several seconds to minutes later. This only happens when just connected to a wifi network. If I have been connected for a while it will work normally. I can easily reproduce the problem by start playing, disabling and enabling wifi and let it connect, then pause on headphones. Tested on 0.9.7.5 as well as develop versions.

		I noticed this problem first with v0.9.7.5 with Freakshow's AAC feed: http://freakshow.fm/feed/m4a/ and now again with http://www.raumschiff-rumdenker.de/feed/mpeg-4/. Episodes are played at maybe 10% of the normal speed. Increasing the playback speed changed something, but even 3x wasn't fast enough to make any speech understandable. Strangely, the time display looked normal, only the audio was too slow.

		When the automatic download updates the feeds and a new episode is found, that episode is not downloaded immediately. Instead AntennaPod will wait for your custom set update interval (2h in my case). Leaving the house with an undownloaded episode is a bit annoying, easpecially when the download would have only taken a few seconds on your wifi. I did not test if that issue appears when setting a high update interval, but if it does one would receive all new episodes only after a high delay. My personal fix is to regularly check for new podcasts and hitting the update button manully, but I would like AntennaPod to be purely push- and not pull-style.

		Following the principal of not having a user option if the author or software can choose for you, I suggest removing the &quot;Headphones disconnect&quot; option, and acting as if it is always ticked. In other words, make the app always pause when the headphones are removed without giving the user the choice to make the app behave otherwise. My reasoning is that almost all users will have this option ticked already, making the option redundant and just taking up space in the Settings screen. I cannot see any reason why anyone would want playback to continue when headphones are removed. If for some reason someone wanted to share a good bit of a podcast with a wider audience, they could just press the play button after they remove the headphones.

		Needs a way to organize downloaded podcasts by holding and sliding them up or down. An auto to organize them by episode number would be nice as well. The current options of move to the top or bottom are very much limited. It would be nice to organize the un-downloaded podcasts from old to new as well in case one wants to listen to a pod channel from the beginning.

		IMHO it would make more sense if the last played episode would come first. Short: reverse order

		Example of rss feed: http://news.tut.by/rss/s~1185.rss. Updated weekly. Initially, items in feed are populated without media content. This is an announcement. AntennaPod shows this item with no media content attached. After one - two days there media content was added. AntennaPod shows that no media content was attached to this rss item after updating feed.

		When listening to downloaded audio podcasts with the screen off on Android 4.4.2 the playback stops before the end of the file. For example, on one of the MP3s from http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/thpop/rss.xml it stops around 15 seconds from the end when the device is locked, but continues to the end if the screen is on. I've seen this on a Nexus 5 using version 0.9.8.0 from the Play store, and on an generic emulated device with the current master, develop and playbackservice_rewrite branches. An emulated Android 4.2.2 image doesn't have any trouble.

		Sometimes when listening to podcasts one gets distracted a bit, but not intense or long enough to pause the podcast playback, for example when sitting on a train and there's an announcement where one does not know from the beginning if it is important for oneself. In such cases I like to jump back some seconds in the playback where the jump buttons in the player come in quite handy. But it would be even nicer if those buttons were also on the lock screen widget, as this way one would not have to unlock the phone and fire up antennapod to do so.

		The order of the list of podcast feeds seems to be ordered in ASCII order, i.e. it is case-sensitive. Thus, the position of a podcast named abcdef is after that of ZYXWVU, which seems counter-intuitive to me. It would be better if the order would be case-insensitive, i.e. AABB -&gt; abcdef -&gt; ZYWWVU.

		The following feed does not correctly update with AntennaPod: http://podcast.hr2.de/derTag/podcast.xml Once I add the podcast to AntennaPod everything is fine. As soon as I try to make an update, new entries are not added, intead the latest entry is removed. So if I 2 times try to make an update, the first 2 entries are removed. Seems to be a bug of Antennapod. Please fix this issue. thanks chris412

		It seems to me that there is no ipv6 support implemented. I've setup my own mygpo instance on a shared ipv4. AntennaPod throws an exception regarding wrong hostname in cert cause of missing sni support. The mygpo instance is also available on a dedicated IPv6 but it seems ipv6 is completely ignored and it always falls back to the A-record (the shared ipv4 with the missing sni problem in antennapod). Would be nice if ipv6 and/or sni would be implemented.

		A while ago my local NPR station &quot;upgraded&quot; their web site and the new podcast feeds don't work in AntennaPod. That is, each episode shows up, but only the episode description but no media. I tried the feed in foobar2000 and it worked, so I'm suspecting there's a corner case in their RSS. The feed I've been looking at is http://wnpr.org/podcasts/47/rss.xml but I suspect any on that site have the same issue. I am running AntennaPod 0.9.8.0 (though previous versions had the same issue) from f-droid on my Kindle Fire. Thanks for a fantastic podcast tool!

		It seems like the regular update/refresh action does not sync the subscription list from gpodder.net. I had to update several times, before a new subscription was picked up. I think that a separate &quot;Sync with gpodder.net&quot; button in the gpodder.net settings would be useful, which would explicitly carry out that action. Apart from that, the regular update/refresh action could be improved to always sync with gpodder.net, too.

		Newest update (Late Feb 2014) does no play video from RSS feed on a Logitech Revue Google TV, running Android v3.2. The audio from the video can be heard for a few seconds and then stops prematurely. The playback screen is black during this time (no video can be seen). These are RSS video feeds that played normally under the previous version of the app just days earlier. I tested it with video feeds from multiple sources, each have the same issue.

		Recently this problem showed up. I think its related to the new 0.9.8.1 release but can't be sure. My podcast finishes playing and AntennaPod gets into a stuck state. It looks like the file is still playing. I can't get it to stop or allow me to delete the file. I can delete the app's data but that's a tad extreme.

   From the Fragment documentation:
   Every fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated
   when restoring its activity's state. It is strongly recommended that
   subclasses do not have other constructors with parameters, since these
   constructors will not be called when the fragment is re-instantiated;
   instead, arguments can be supplied by the caller with setArguments(Bundle)
   and later retrieved by the Fragment with getArguments().

		It seems impossible to delete the last podcast of the playlist. Even if skipping this episode (effectively completely clearing the playlist), it still can't be removed from within its feed overview. The only options offered are to skip the epidosde (which doesn't make any sense) and to add it to the playlist again.

		I'm running 0.9.8.2 on a Moto X with Android 4.2.2. I have auto download set but new podcasts are only added to the Waiting List but not downloaded. Aren't they supposed to be downloaded right away? It's possible I do not fully understand how the Waiting List and auto download works, but I compare to Podkicker Pro where new shows are downloaded as soon as a refresh finds a new episode. I am running Podkicker also to compare and it is downloading the new episodes right away.

		Hi, How does the episode cache limit actually work? What will happen if you are up to the limit you've set, have auto download set and are adding a new podcast to the queue whichh should be downloaded? Will the oldest downloaded podcast be deleted or will the new episode not be downloaded until you manually delete episodes keeping you under the set limit? Also is the limit per podcast or total downloaded episodes?

		None of the CNN podcast feeds work with AntennaPod. They get added but when checking episodes all of them show with &quot;Size 0 B&quot; but with correct publication time. The episodes can not be downloaded but can be streamed. These feeds work fine in other players like Podkicker and PodcastAddict. A couple of examples: AC360: http://rss.cnn.com/services/podcasting/ac360audio/rss Erin Burnett Out Front: http://rss.cnn.com/services/podcasting/eboutfront/rss I'm running 0.9.8.2 on Android 4.2.2

		Hi, All media players I use and have used on Android respond to standard external input for &quot;Fast Forward, &quot;Next&quot;, &quot;Previous&quot; etc. inputs. I was surprised when AntennaPod only responds to &quot;Play/Pause&quot; but none of the other media controls. This matters since I use the HeadsetButton Controller app and also Bluetooth headsets with more than &quot;Play/Pause&quot; controls and they do not work with AntennaPod. It would be very helpful if AntennaPod could respond like other players to external playback controls

		I'm working off the develop branch, fetched two hours ago. Normally I wouldn't write a bug report about the develop branch, but considering you merged it to the master branch 6 hours ago, I think it's fine. To reproduce this Have an empty queue Go the podcasts tab and play something directly from the list (so without adding anything to the queue). Finish the episode (doesn't matter how: skip, slide, listen) Repeat 2, but make sure it's the same episode 4a. Notice that you can't play the episode. 4b. Notice that the episode is now in the queue, but can't play it from there either 4c. Remove and repeat 4 will result in the same situation. How to get out of this situation (sometimes) Play a different episode Finish the episode (doesn't matter how: skip, slide, listen) The app should skip to the next episode Sometimes you can play this, sometimes you can't, but when you can and the episode finishes, things will go back to normal.

		Hi, I would like an option to have new episodes downloaded directly to the Waiting List and not wait until added to the Queue or until next refresh. It could be a setting under Automatic Download: &quot;Download directly to Waiting List&quot;. Personally I would like this to be default behavior. I do not really understand why automatic download is tied to adding to queue or the next refresh like it is now. It works but isn't as automated as I would like it to be. I would like all new episodes download as soon as they come in.

		So, apparently the newest version downloads episode pictures. My issue is that most of my podcast provide an image for each episode (although it's apparently always just the logo/image of the podcast itself) and with some feeds containing 100+ or even 300+ episodes, I now have an &quot;images&quot; folder with 100+mb of completely useless copies of a few podcast images, and that was after I quit the update by force-closing the app halfway through. One example is &quot;Stop Podcasting Yourself&quot;.. over 300 episodes and each one has a 500kb 1400x1400px jpg file. So the images from that podcast alone would use up ~150mb on my phone. And that's just one podcast. It's the most egregious example, but it's a problem with many feeds. Judge John Hodgman for example..150x152kb. Especially for people with limited data, actually doing that first refresh with the newest version can really screw you over (luckily I was on wifi). But even then, 100-200mb for pointless episode images is a waste considering the limited storage on most phones. Additionally it seems like a download queue of 1000+ can crash the app. There needs to be a way to deal with this and imho it shouldn't be default behavior, especially not on mobile data.

		I am using AntennaPod android 0.9.8.3 with continuous playback of audio podcasts. My Android version is 4.4.2 Since several weeks now, the playback of the current playing audio podcasts stops to early and the next podcasts does not start at the beginning. In both cases approx. 5 seconds are missing at the end / in the beginning of the next one. This problems does occur with every audio podcast that I am playing. The same problem is reported by my wife. She uses the same Android and AntennePod versions. I have continuous playback enabled as I use the device during my daily commuting routine. Please help!

The cache functionality isn't applicable for this case because this would delete also files which I would like to keep e.g. podcasts where a felt asleep before the end ;)

		I really like the new UI, but more than how it looks I am concerned about how it works. I am hoping to be able to have AntennaPod work like this: All new episodes are downloaded immediately, not with the next refresh like it is today. I also want all new episodes automatically to be added the the queue. And finally I would like to either be able to set which screen it opens to (Queue or New Episodes) or that it opens to the screen you had open when you closed it. I would like new episodes added to the top of the queue by default (at least as an options also. Finally I want episodes automatically deleted when they are played although I can live with the current episode cache method of limited storage use by AntennaPod. How happy should I be with the new UI in this regard, or are the things I am talking about not part of the redesign?

		I have discovered an issue with the new UI, there's no easy way to add all new episodes to the queue in one operation. You have to add them one by one. That was not the case in the current UI where you could add all from the waiting list to the queue. Or maybe I am missing something? If #316 got fixed this would not be an issue.

		I have a whole bunch of podcasts in my AntennaPod with some of them being feeds from radio stations, which generate a lot episodes (several per day) and where I'm only interested in single episodes. Every other day (like once a week or so) I browse through all the podcasts I have in my list and add the episodes I'm interested in to my playlist. This is of course easiest done by selecting one source and going to all the new tracks there and then proceed with the next source. Therefore I then end up with a playlist that has the tracks in the order in which I have added them, i.e. with lets say 5 tracks from radio station A then two from station B and so on. Especially with topics that are currently in the news it would be convenient if there was an option to sort the tracks chronologically by their release date. For example a menu (maybe also with other sort orders) in the &quot;organize playlist&quot; view could do that.

		In the 0.9.9-NewUI-nightly, this podcast feed results in a truncated URL-display: &quot;http:/. Not sure if it's a bug in AntennaPod, or a broken feed. Either way, a fall back to simply &quot;domain.tld&quot; might be a good idea.

		Hi, The Frontline audio podcast suddenly started to kill AntennaPod. Every time I refreshed AntennaPod died without any error message. I removed all feeds and added one at a time from my opml until I got to the one that made AntennaPod crash. It was Frontline from PBS. The feed URL is: http://feeds.feedburner.com/FrontlineAudiocastPbs This feed has worked until today. I do not mind that some feeds may not work with AntennaPod, but that a feed kills the app instantly is difficult to work with and troubleshoot. It took quite a while getting through all my feeds to find the perpetrator! :)

			<description>
		I have a few ideas for refactorings I’d like to run by the project. When I implemented OPML backup I saw some places where I think it would be beneficial for the app to “offload” functionality to other libraries and services. Less code (and sources of bugs) at the expense (possibly) of less control. Specifically, EventDistributor can be replaced (or backed) with LocalBroadcastManager that ships with the support libaries This is a small change and would be straight forward to implement. The EventDistributor API could stay the same. Use Volley (or other library designed to download small files) to download feeds and images (it also does caching) Use the Download Manager to download podcasts and videos Getting HTTP downloads right is not straight forward (AntennaPod has 8 classes for this purpose) and requires threads, locks, background services and notifications to work properly. Download Manager takes care of all that and does retries as well as handles connectivity failures. It is not clear that using Download Manager would work exactly the same as the current solution, but I think it will and I’m willing to give it a shot. I appreciate all the time and effort that was put in to these parts of the app, and would totally understand if there's hesitation in changing them too much. The obvious reason not to is that it currently works. Also, these changes would not change how AntennaPod functions or looks. If, however, you think it’d be a good idea to simplify the code base then I would be interested in seeing if we can make it work. What do you think?

		From time to time I'm downloading podcasts manually (mainly because they are not propagated within the feed itself anymore). When opening these files in the file explorer, it is not possible to select AntennaPod as an option. I would like to use AntennaPod for this purpose, though, because of its playback speed options and because I don't want to bother installing another application for that matter alone.

		Hi, I have AntennaPod set to auto-downoad and keep an episode cache of 20. But when I was checking I had at least 40 episodes. AntennaPod was still deleting episodes but there were really old ones in there and even some duplicates. How does AntennaPod keep track of how many episodes are in the cache and is there anything I can do to get the cache back within the set limit?

		Hi, after the 0.9.9.0 release with the new UI became available on F-Droid I was finally able to test the new UI. Some feedback from my perspective: I like that there is finally a view that shows all downloaded items. Great that play list manipulation (moving up/down etc.) is much easier now. I seem to accidentally swipe off episodes too easily, but that may be just my clumsy fingers. Deletion on long press or context menu or so might be safer. Please bring back display of playing time and possibly release date and podcast name to items in the playlist. This seems to be only available in the Downloads/Finished view. Release date and podcast name should at least be avaibale from the episode detail view. But playing time is quite essential for me. One thing that feels really completely wrong is that in the All Episodes view, when trying to scroll up from the top of the list, a refresh of all podcasts is triggered. This alone makes this view completely unusable for me. Please note that this process can take quite some time and it seems that other parts (Playlist etc.) are not accessible at all. (I have a lot of podcasts and not the fastest device on the market.) IMO it should only be triggered explicitly and not accidentally when scrolling a list where one even cannot see whether one is at the top of the list or not. Even worse as when entering the app from the widget and clicking in the upper left of the player one ends up automatically in this view. Also there is the refresh button in the upper right, why should one be able to trigger this in another way? Anyway, please keep up the good work and thanks for releasing the software for free. Edit: It would also be great if the number of contained episodes would be visible again at the top of the list as before.

		AntennaPod is now so close to perfect I feel the need to repeat the few issues I have. The most important one is a setting to have new episodes added to the top of the queue, #424 . For me it's much easier to move podcasts down than up, and the concept of having the newest on top suits my workflow better.

		One of the feeds I subscribe to references an episode that has either been deleted, moved or renamed. With the new version of AP, it ends up repeatedly trying to download it every 2 seconds - I had to remove episode from the queue to stop it. Is this something to do with the new code to re-attempt failed downloads?

		On Android 4.04 the latest version of the app fails to download many of my feeds that worked without any problems previously. In the log tab, I get errors including &quot;parser exceptions&quot; and &quot;unsupported feed type&quot;. Also in the notification area I get &quot;processing download&quot; that I can only kill if I force close the app. Related issue I guess. I hope it can be fixed because this was a great app.

		The feed http://www.radioradicale.it/podcasting.php?e=74 only works just after being added to antennapod. When I try to update it, it doesn't download new episodes; the only way to get new episodes is by removing the feed and re-adding it. I guess there must be something wrong with the feed (feedvalidator.org shows some errors), but the feed works fine with other podcast clients (e.g. gpodder on my desktop), so maybe antennapod could be &quot;fixed&quot; to support it? Of course if you can spot the problem in the feed, I will be happy to forward the problem to the original author so that it can be fixed.

		When the &quot;All episodes&quot; view is empty there are 3 icons in the right upper corner: search synchronize (look for new episodes) menu But when there are some episodes the synchronize option moves into the menu and instead there is the &quot;mark all as read/listen&quot; icon. In my opinion this option should be in the menu and the synchronize icon should always be on the view in the upper corner. It's too easy to unintentionally click the &quot;mark all as read/listen&quot; icon and loose all new episodes

		With version 0.9.9.0 episodes that have just been downloaded can be played only one time. After listening to the episode, if I go back to the episode list then open the episode again, I get an &quot;empty&quot; (no image, duration 00:00:00) episode window. To re-play the episode, I have to start playing a different episode, stop, go back to the original episode and now it can be played again. This bug only affects episodes that have just been downloaded in the current session, episodes donwloaded in previous sessions can be re-played without problems.

		I have a small issue with the new UI: I don't find the 'All episodes' screen very useful. It shows every episode of every podcast grouped by podcast* (hundreds of episodes). When 'show only new episodes' is selected the screen is empty (because they have been automatically downloaded and queued). As all of my newly downloaded episodes are sitting in the 'Queue' I'd like that to be the screen I see whenever I open AntennaPod. Could there be an option to make the queue the starting screen? * it'd make more sense if they were in descending chronological order with the newest episodes at the top - edit: I think it does this on some feeds not others, several feeds seem to appear at the top with every episode's date set to today

		If I remove an item from the queue by swiping it to the side I am informed I can undo this by pressing the back button. Doing this causes me to leave Antennapod for the Android home screen with no clue as to whether the removal has been done. In general it seems too easy to remove things from the queue accidentally. It would be nice to have an option to require confirmation before removal rather than undo afterward or a screen with recently removed items on it from which they can be restored.

		Hi, I checked the option &quot;Continuous playback&quot;, and it's working fine with audio files. However, for videos after finishing one item, the player only selects the next one in the list, but doesn't start it automatically, so you have to press &quot;PLAY&quot; manually. Please fix this very annoying issue, when taking a bath in the tub, I don't want to get my tablet wet :-) Thanks!

		A minor usability annoyance: When a podcast has an intermittent article in the feed that doesn't have a media attachment, the only way to get it out of the &quot;All Episodes&quot; view is through the &quot;Mark all as read&quot; item on the list. Only those entries with media enclosures have the individual &quot;Mark as read&quot; items. Unless I've been missing the obvious - in that case I'm suggesting to make it better visible, e.g. in the same place (article details) where you can find it for articles with media enclosures.

		related to #106 Some podcasts use those for some reason, resulting in ineligible shownotes, esp. in the dark theme. I have written to them, kindly requesting to know why and/or to stop. What are your opinions on this? Is there a substantial use-case that justifies accepting the theme incompatibility? How about implementing ignorance towards such formatting?

		I love this app! But there's one bug that is getting me on the brink of switching. Not always, but very often, when I come back to an episode that I've started listening to before, it does not resume from where I paused it. It does not matter if I have played another episode since or if I just paused this episode, closed the app and came back later. Often the seeker is at the correct place, but when I hit play, it jumps either to the very begining of the episode, or to somewhere close to the beginning. I've had this issue since the previous version of AntennaPod, and on two different phones with both stock Android and Cyanogenmod. I'm using 0.9.9.0 now, and it's the same. I hope this will be fixed soon. I'd hate to switch to a non-Free podcast app and I really want to be able to recommend AntennaPod to my friends! Thanks!

		Version: 0.9.9.1 von F-Droid OS: CyanogenMod 11m8 (Android 4.4.4) Gerät: Samsung Galaxy S2 In der &quot;Alle Episoden&quot;-Ansicht wird bei mir öfters nach Drücken des Menübuttons am Gerät (nicht des ... Buttons oben rechts) das Menü in 2 Schritten aufgebaut, anstatt in einem Rutsch vollständig angezeigt zu werden. Leider habe ich so schon öfters &quot;Alle als gelesen markieren&quot; getroffen, obwohl ich eigentlich &quot;Aktualisieren&quot; wollte. Letzterer wurde durch einen anderen Menüeintrag, der den Bruchteil einer Sekunde später auftauchte, nach oben geschoben. Habe leider noch kein Muster dieses Problems gefunden. Evtl., wenn die Liste aller neuen Episoden schon etwas länger (ca. 20) wurde. Dodgy menu display In the &quot;All episodes&quot; view pressing the device's menu button (not the ... in the top right corner) sometimes results in the menu being displayed in two steps instead of being displayed in full in one go. Unfortunately, I've therefore hit &quot;Mark as read&quot; often already, even though I wanted to &quot;Refresh&quot;, because the latter got pushed upwards by another menu entry appearing a fraction of a second later. Unfortunately, I found no pattern of this problem so far. Maybe it appears when the list of all episodes grew larger (ca. 20).

		related (maybe an alternative) to #490 My most common mode of subscribing to a new podcast is because I got interested in its most current episode. This currently involves a lot of clicking so it would be nice if the general Auto-download option could also determine what happens to the latest episode of a newly subscribed podcast. If it is set, it should be downloaded. What do you think?

		I have a Nokia BH-217 headset that works fine with CSipSimple and Skype. It is connected to my Nexus 7 running CyanogenMod cm-11-20140804-SNAPSHOT-M9 and is used by CSipSimple. AntennaPod 0.9.9.3 however refuses to use it and is instead using the speaker. How can I get AntennaPod to use this Bluetooth headset? According to Android this headset only offers one profile &quot;Phone audio&quot; and the list under &quot;paired Bluetooth devices&quot; says &quot;Connected to phone audio&quot;. According to Nokia's documentation: &quot;The headset is compliant with the Bluetooth Specification 2.1 + EDR supporting the Headset Profile 1.1 and Hands-Free Profile 1.5.&quot; Thank you for AntennaPod!

		Hello! In the old UI it was possible to add items to the queue and then select 'download all'. I would appreciate if this behaviour would return as the new one can cause trouble when one wants to download several episodes with different file sizes. For example, a podcaster released three new episodes with different lengths: Episode One (1:00) Episode Two (0:45) Episode Three (0:30) Naturally, I would like to listen to the episodes in the correct order, but when I download them, Episode Three will be completed first and added to the queue first so that, in this example, they end up with the opposite order on the queue. Thanks in advance! Cheers

		I recently added a podcast which happened to have the same title as one of the podcasts I already had, except for one letter that was lowercase in one title and uppercase in the other title. Here they are: http://www.rtl.fr/podcast/la-revue-de-presse.xml (title: &quot;La revue de Presse&quot;) http://cdn-new-europe1.ladmedia.fr/var/exports/podcasts/sound/revue-de-presse.xml (title: &quot;La revue de presse&quot;) After refreshing my episode list, I got broken entries, as if AntennaPod mixed the 2 podcasts somehow (title from one of the podcast, with photo from the other podcast for instance). Since podcast infos are kept in files named after the podcast titles on my FAT32 formatted memory card (case insensitive filesystem), my best guess is that when refreshing the whole episode list, the files from one of the podcasts overwrite the files from the other podcast.

		Hi AntennaPod-Team, I observed an undesired behavior of AntennaPod. The &quot;PlaybackService&quot; hangs in status &quot;Will be restarted&quot; (in German: &quot;Neustart wird durchgeführt&quot;). This happens even if the application has been closed weeks ago and several other applications have been unsed in the meantime. Please see screenshot attached. How to reproduce: Start AntennaPod Start playback of a previously downloaded podcast (I use the play-button at the bottom of the screen which starts the most recent played podcast) After round about one hour: Stopp playback (I use the stopp-button at the bottom of the screen) Leave AntennaPod by pressing &quot;back-button&quot; several times (until I'm back on homescreen) Check taskmanager after several days of heavy usage of my device --&gt; PlaybackService says: ---- &quot;will be restarted&quot;, ---- Size: &quot;0.00 B&quot;, ---- 0 Processes, 1 Service See screenshot attached. Expected: AntennaPod and PlaybackService should be closed properly and not must appear in the taskmanager (at least not in this status) My setup: HTC One S, Android Version 4.1.1 Please let me know if you need further information or tests. Thank you for that great app!! WF

		The first time you add a podcast, app tries to download all of the entries of the podcast, even the very old ones. That makes an annoying attempt to download episodes that already don't exist (404 error) and notification bar shows the error again and again. A configurable limit by number (since the last one) or by date should be supported. In this way, Antennapod would &quot;forget&quot; the old entries when the automatic download is enabled.

		Hey, first off, love AntennaPod. Just have been having some weird issues that seem to be independent of any updates to the app or Android. As far as I can tell, they appeared out of nowhere. The biggest issue is that pushing the play button next to a podcast in the queue no longer plays the podcast. instead, it takes me to the playback screen of the currently playing podcast (which remains paused). I can push the play button in the queue repeatedly and sometimes after a few presses it will take me to the playback screen and I can hit play again and the cast plays, but sometimes it can be upwards of 20 presses. If there is not a podcast currently playing then I can switch to any other podcast. Sometimes I will get an playback error message and then the playback screen will come up empty and I can play a new podcast then. Another (I'm guessing) related issue is that continuous playback is checked but when a podcast ends and a new one loads, it does not play automatically. Continuous playback is checked in the setttings. I'm running version 0.9.9.3 on a Republic Wireless Moto X running Android 4.4.2

		Device: Samsung S3, Android 4.3, AntennaPod Ver 0.9.9.3 Assuming Skip Episode is not supposed to be a Skip Episode with an automatic delete function, which if it is, only Skips the episode for me. It would be great if there was a Delete button on the screen while in the specific episode with Delete being listed form the Menu button or maybe even at the top of the screen in the centre between the back to the main screen menu and http link. Daniel big thanks to you and all the people that help to make this great app!

		Hi AntennaPod-Team, after a certain time of playback, AntennaPod stps playing audio. It just breaks off, but AntennaPod still shows the play button and I can also press pause and stop. Also a complete restart of the app is useless, I have to start every time the whole Cell Phone new. How to reproduce: The whole thing is not reproducible by time or by user interaction. Expected: No crashing audio. My setup: build.brand: Samsung build.host: cyanogenmod build.product: GT-I9100 version.release: 4.4.4 version.sdk_int: 19 log: http://pastebin.com/ss93LdGN

		What I'd like is when adding a podcast the option to queue it in chronological order (I.E. Append the podcast to the queue, oldest episode first, newest episode last). Imagine you had this queue already:- Podcast 1 - Season 5 - Episode 4 Podcast 2 - Season 2 - Episode 8 Then added Podcast 3, which is has two seasons of 5 episodes each, it'd end up with:- Podcast 1 - Season 5 - Episode 4 Podcast 2 - Season 2 - Episode 8 Podcast 3 - Season 1 - Episode 1 Podcast 3 - Season 1 - Episode 2 Podcast 3 - Season 1 - Episode 3 Podcast 3 - Season 1 - Episode 4 Podcast 3 - Season 1 - Episode 5 Podcast 3 - Season 2 - Episode 1 Podcast 3 - Season 2 - Episode 2 Podcast 3 - Season 2 - Episode 3 Podcast 3 - Season 2 - Episode 4 Podcast 3 - Season 2 - Episode 5 This would be useful for people who like to listen to the backlog of a Podcast. Maybe also add some advanced options (Reverse order, only add newest X episodes/time, Regex, only add season X-Y,Z), etc... Maybe also add the option to the podcast's page.

		I removed a podcast as the new entries were refusing to download, now I can't re-subscribe, so I suspect something in the feed. Validators seem OK with it. It may be that there's some trace of my previous subscription, though I've tried to delete all files associated with it. Does this work for others? http://mediaweb.musicradio.com/RSSFeed.xml?Channel=9495 I'm on v0.9.9.3 on Android 4.0.3 (yes it's an old phone!)

		I have an issue with AntennaPod. After downloading a lot of podcasts, it does not play podcasts any more. I'll try to describe the problem and its circumstances. I had no previous issues with antenna pod. It all worked flawlessly Suddenly, Antennapod would not play any episode anymore. This was correlated with me downloading quite a few new podcasts episodes. Although I do not know whether this is a coincidence or if there is more to this. At the moment, I can see the &quot;Abspielliste&quot;, &quot;Alle Episoden&quot; etc. but as soon as I play an episode, antennapod stalls and crashes eventually before playing one sound.

		One of Android 5.0 APIs is the Media playback. Quoting from here, http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html, &quot;If you are implementing notifications that present media playback status or transport controls, consider using the new Notification.MediaStyle template instead of a custom RemoteViews.RemoteView object. Whichever approach you choose, make sure to set the notification's visibility to VISIBILITY_PUBLIC so that your controls are accessible from the lock screen. Note that beginning in Android 5.0, the system no longer shows RemoteControlClient objects on the lock screen. For more information, see If your app uses RemoteControlClient.&quot; Notification.MediaStyle can be found here: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.MediaStyle.html Unfortunately, the solution provided in Issue #405 doesn't seem like it will be supported in Android 5.0 and on.

		Hi There I have been trying to add a certain podcast feed to antennaPod list. It is the podcast for &quot;Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast&quot;. Every time I add the feed it thinks every podcast is today. The next day when I updated the feed it increments the day and shows every podcast as today. I've had the feed in the app for a week and it does the same thing every day. The issue looks very similar to an issue reported before, #178, which was marked as won't fix because the was a legal issue with that feeds contents. The feed in this case is sourced via a feedburner link, I would have assumed there would have been some legal checks performed on it. I have check the pubDate values and they are all different dates. However I did notice that the timezone region is listed as GMT, not something like +0000. </description>

		Since this afternoon AntennaPod gives an error No external storage is avalable. Please make sure external storage is mounted so that the app can work properly I've used the app this morning, so I am not quite sure what has changed to cause this error. When I clear the data on the app, the app seems to be functional again. I haven't tried downloading podcasts after clearing data. I have a OnePlus One, so no SD-card. The /sdcard partition is filled and looks normal from ES File Explorer.

		The scroll position should of the Queue list should be saved and remembered, at least for the session if not in a persistent manner. I tend to keep quite a lot of podcast episodes in the AntennaPod queue for later listening (20-40 episodes). The current/recent episodes always reside at the bottom. So each time I want to select one of them, I need to scroll down all the way. When I change to the All Episodes view (to trigger a manual refresh for example) and then change back to Queue I have to scroll down again. This happens multiple times each day for me, so I'd be glad if this enhancement could be implemented soon. Thanks for working on AntennaPod!

		Two days ago I updated my phone (Nexus 5) to Android 5.0/Lollipop. Antennapod works like before. But yesterday there was a new Antennapod update (0.9.9.5) and now the playback speed controls are missing. I'm able to set the playback speeds in the setting menu, but I can't speed up the playback in the podcast view when listening to an podcast. I tried to uninstall und reinstall Prestissimo, but this doesn't help.

This is occurring v0.9.9.5 on the Lollipop operation system, Nexus 5 phone. Restarting, clearing the chase or rebooting didn't make a difference either. (same as sthesing)

		In the latest version Antenna Pod stopped playing podcasts through BT. The phone seems to be paired and connected correctly, but plays the podcast through the internal speaker of my nexus 5 (Lollipop). However, When I shutdown the BT Audio device, AntennaPod still notices that the connection was lost, and stops the podcast, even though it was played through the internal speaker. When I play AntennaPod first, and only then I turn on the BT device, it connects, the music plays through the BT device for ~1 sec, and then switches back to the internal speaker! All of this used to work 100% a day or two ago. System Info: Phone: Nexus 5 with Lollipop. 2 BT devices: Jabra Cruiser2 configured only for &quot;Phone Audio&quot; and &quot;Contact Sharing&quot; Generic Chinese A2DP BT to 3.5mm stereo adapter (BT ID is &quot;H163&quot;), configured for &quot;Media Audio&quot;

		At least in JellyBean (4.1.2). Sent several reports. Without menu button, unable to access settings. Previous version was fine. The fact nobody other has open a bug for this makes me suspect that it does not happen in KitKat or Lollipod? It produces a java.lang.NullPointerException in class com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow method oneKeyUpPanel line number 1002. Observed similar behaviour in some other apps after adapted to lollipop (not sure if it's related, but suspicious).

		Hi, first of all, thanks for the app. On the lock screen using Android 5 / Lollipop, the app offers these controls: Play, Pause, Stop. I'd prefer a different set of controls: Rewind, Play/Pause*, Forward. (* The control should change depending on the current state of playback.) Use case is simple: While listening, I often rewind a few seconds if I missed something during a podcast. Also, I never use &quot;stop&quot;, only &quot;pause&quot;.

			<description>
		Apparently AntennaPod stores audio files using the episode title as the filename (as opposed to using the original filename from the URL). If the episode title is too long then it is not possible to download the episode due to a filesystem limitation -- it can still be streamed though. The typical limit for a filename on common filesystems is 255 bytes.

		First of all I'd like to congratulate for this great podcast app! :-) I wonder if it would be possible to implement a feed-specific button to hide/unhide episodes which haven't been downloaded yet. Let me give you a short background on that: I usually don't download all podcast episodes from a feed (it would take to much space on my mobile phone) and if there are a lot of episodes it's hard to keep track of which ones are already downloaded (which I preferably would like to listen to) and which are not. This would make it easier to keep an oversight of downloaded files in a feed-specific way.

		Hi, There are some compatibility issues with the following Podcasts: http://resource.ffh.de/podcasts/ffh/rachederwartenden.rss http://static.rpr1.de/podcast/abenteuer/abenteuer.xml These 2 XML feeds are not correctly parsed and it seems that AntennaPod always identifies each entry as a new element. Additional the file-size does not match. Do you know the reason? Are there any possibilities to fix this issue? Best regards Chris

		I have chosen black backgrounds wherever I can. When opening Antennapod, there's always a flash of white screen before my Dark theme is applied (and content loaded). This is glaring (especially at night), and wastes power etc. I would like that, at least when the Dark theme is selected, the app starts with a black background.

		By default I think the 'Queue' should be the first screen the user sees and not 'All Episodes'. The rational is that the user came in to the app for the most common operation: listening to podcasts. Putting them in 'All Episodes' first makes them take an extra couple of steps to get to what they really want. I could see only defaulting to Queue if there are actually episodes in the queue. Thoughts?

		Consider the following use case: User is subscribed to a number of podcasts User's queue is full with previously downloaded podcasts All the episodes in the queue are stale. The user doesn't want to listen to them (they already listened to them, they got behind, whatever). With the current model the user would have to manually remove all the episodes from the queue, one by one. That can be very time consuming and tedious with a long queue. If there were a 'empty queue' or 'clear queue' command the user could issue that command, all the episodes in the queue would be removed and then, when the system auto-updates, the queue would be filled with the latest episodes from their various subscriptions. Worthwhile?

		I have just done it. For a while I have been fearing the possibility and now it has turned into a reality. Because, in All episodes view, 'Refresh' option is right above 'Mark all episodes as read', and also in part due to me being slightly retarded, I accidentally touched the latter in place of the former. With no confirmation requested and no undo option available, I am now unaware of what episodes I have and haven't heard, and moderately bemused over this situation. I really wish there were a confirmation step or an undo option to this. Thank you for your time, attention and a great app.

		BBC Today In Parliament don't give any indication of date in their show titles or descriptions, so I'm often left looking at the list in AntennaPod wondering which one is most recent (having reorganised my queue several times). I see there's a date in the raw xml (below), nicely displayed by firefox. It would be great if AntennaPod could display the date somewhere. It's a daily show so quite high volume. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtqd http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/tip http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/tip/rss.xml Many thanks for such a great piece of software.

I also noticed that a version of this app in the blackberry world app market is out of date with the current master and 1.0 tag. I'd like to offer to take over the maintenance of the blackberry specific functionality, testing and release management, if it in fact is currently being done by the same team here? If not would it be advisable that I just create a fork to continue on with the project?

Everything worked fine on v0.9.9.4, however, now on v1.0 I'm always prompted to reenter my credentials when I want to download a new entry although previously saved. However, reentering the login information does nothing so that the download fails in general. I've already triple-checked by password. Furthermore, I deleted and reinstalled the pod, without any changes. Ideas? — running on CM11 M9, Android 4.4.4

		In the menu you can set a fast forward/backward step width between 5 and 60 seconds. This value will be applied on both, forward and backward. The most frequent use cases for fast forward/backward are (in my opinion/experience): you want to skip some less interesting passage and find a point to continue listening you want to repeat a passage of about the last minute, maybe you have not listened to concentrated enough and and you must find the exact starting point again For both use cases an unsymmetric forward/backward step size which allows you to step forward coarse and find the exact point stepping backward fine. For example Linux Totem Video Player uses this technique with fixed step sizes of +60s / -15s. It is very easy to find a desired point by this means. My suggestion is to gives the possibility to selcet forward/backward step widths independantly by providing: separate inputs for both values - or - an input for fast forward and an extra multiplier for backward ratio: 0.1 / 0.25 / 0.5 / 1 (optional additionally: 2 / 4 / 10)

		In either the All Episodes or Queue, it is possible to play the episode using the play button at the right of the item. This button changes into a pause button as expected; however, it doesn't function as one. If tapped upon, it goes into the media view without pausing. Note: it is possible to pause using other methods, but the button in the list view never changes between play and pause after it has changed to pause.

		I think it be a cool feature to have a setting where you can specify amount of time, minutes, seconds etc. where if a podcast is stopped then it is marked as playing. I realize we can do this manually by marking as played from the queue, but there are cases where I'll skip to next track in my queue with a minute or something left just to skip the outro.

		It had been implemented using the method outlined here: http://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/battery-monitoring.html However, that method isn't working anymore. In the logs we see that the call to intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_STATUS, -1) is returning -1. It isn't clear why this happened. We could resolve it by creating two different power connection listeners, ones that just handled connected/disconnected. I'd be interested in figuring out why this happened however. What changed? Continuing to look at it.

		Hi, Sometimes when I click the play button in the queue the episode starts playing, but more often it doesn't and I'm taken to playback and have to click 'play' from there again. What's the mechanism behind this and would it be possible to consistently have episodes play directly from the queue? The queue is what I work from all the time and would like to have a way to not having to leave it unless I want more information about an episode.

		It would be nice if you could swipe an item in the 'All Episodes' list to mark it as read. Granted, this only makes sense if you're only displaying 'new' items, but I think it might be a common use case. The problem is that DSLV doesn't support lists that can remove items but that don't want to be dragged around. I took a stab at this here: https://github.com/TomHennen/AntennaPod/tree/swipe_to_mark_as_read but was thwarted because of the DSLV issue. I may take another look at this in the future, but I figured I'd at least note it as a feature request.

		We've been making some good progress over the last few months and it's time to get ready for a new release. To get ready for that I submitted the current strings file to Transifex. Per @danieloeh I used the 'tx' client. I documented the steps I took on the wiki (https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Updating-Translations). However, I'm not sure I did it properly (this is my first time using Transifex). I'd appreciate it if someone (perhaps @danieloeh) could comment on if things look correct in the instructions and in the Transifex project (https://www.transifex.com/organization/antennapod/dashboard/antennapod). Thanks

		Version 1.1 is about to be released. Some pretty significant changes were made and we'd like to make sure no problems have been introduced. It would really help if people could test the current release build, either by joining the AntennaPod Alpha Google Plus group (https://plus.google.com/communities/117446128636140585144) or by just downloading the latest release build here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4c475h3yst0ys38/AntennaPod-develop-current-release.apk?dl=0 Please report any new bugs that you encounter. As many of you know @danieloeh stopped maintaining the project with 1.0. I'm trying my best to maintain the project properly. If you see that I'm doing anything wrong please let me know. I'd like to thank @mfietz for all the hard works he's put in to fixing bugs and adding new features. He's probably responsible for 70-80% of the changes you'll see in version 1.1. Of course, a big thanks to everyone else that's contributed for this release, their changes have provided some great new features and fixes. Going forward, if anyone would like to contribute, the most valuable thing for me would be if you could build the proposed pull requests and test the functionality introduced in that request. If you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, just add a comment to the PR. If everything works well, please comment saying that everything works well. That will give me more confidence when merging the requests. Thanks everyone!

		Some thoughts about how the navigation drawer could be re-designed. Of course, some ideas might not be completely thought through - Feedback and ideas are appreciated. Basically, I think we should get rid of the Playback history and Downloads in its current form. In order: New episodes: This is already changed in the current build, no further changes required. Think &quot;Inbox&quot;. Queue/Playlist: No changes. If requested, we could also have several Playlists. Feeds might get linked to a specific Playlist where new episodes would be added. Episodes would not get added to &quot;the queue&quot;, but rather &quot;Add to [default playlist]&quot; and &quot;Add to...&quot; (Opens dialog where user can choose playlist, if there a more than one). Playlists could get renamed and episodes could be moved from one to the other. Downloads: Should behave like an &quot;Download folder&quot;. Will show any episodes currently downloaded to the device. Will have the ability to play and delete episodes. Sorting criteria could include publication date, file size, progress, &quot;last usage&quot; and more. Favorites: Would only be displayed if the user actually marked episodes as favorites (yet to be implemented). Actions would basically be the same as Downloads. Being a favorite episode would also be considered when cleaning the cache to download new episodes. Add podcast: No changes. Maybe some small visual changes. +++ Feeds: No changes. +++ Settings: no changes.

		I have a site which is fully protected by HTTP Basic Auth. When users try to add the feed in AntennaPod, they are prompted for the password twice, even though both the website and the feed are on the same domain and use the same HTTP Basic Auth realm. Steps to reproduce: Add the following site to AntennaPod: http://p.j-crew.de Enter the username and password (both are &quot;a&quot;, without the quotes) Confirm the RSS feed (there is only one) Expected result: The password from step 2 above is remembered and used for the feed and for downloading the MP3 files. Actual result: The user is queried again for the password after selecting the feed. Further information: The apache logs can be seen live at http://misc.j-crew.de/p-access.log and http://misc.j-crew.de/p-error.log (to see exactly which URLs were queried). There is an identical site except without HTTP Basic Auth at http://q.j-crew.de for comparison (with logs at http://misc.j-crew.de/q-access.log and http://misc.j-crew.de/q-error.log).

		Specifically PlaybackTests. startLocalPlaybackFromQueue and PlaybackTests. startLocalPlayback are failing. They're failing because they expect the AudioplayerActivity to show up after you click on 'Play' from within 'New Episodes' and 'Queue'. That isn't happening anymore. I don't know when this change was introduced, if it was intentional or inadvertent (if I had to guess I'd say it was #693). I think that, before we make any change, we should figure out what the behavior should be. Do we want the audio player activity to start when you click on 'play' on an item in the list? I'm not sure that makes sense. Any opinions?

		AntennaPod doesn't currently have a way to easily skip to the next episode. You can go to a sub-menu and click 'Skip episode' and that will do it, but it's not very accessible. I personally want to skip past episodes a lot, but that doesn't necessarily mean I want them removed from the queue. I think ideally we could add track forward/back buttons that let you navigate in your queue without removing episodes when you do so. These buttons (or at least forward) should be available on the widgets. Additionally, it should be possible to configure bluetooth buttons to track forward/back instead of rewind/fast forward. Does anyone else think such a thing is desirable? A lower-effort method would be to simply expose 'Skip episode' as a button on the various player widgets. All opinions are appreciated.

		Here is a screenshot from an emulated Moto X running 4.4.4: When the episode cache dialog opens, the first entry is completely invisible. I find this extremely user unfriendly, I should not have to scroll in such dialogs. I think we should get rid of at least 2 options. 1 and 2 seem completely unnecessary. Proposal: Unlimited, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 Another solution could be to have have the option unlimited (and maybe some valies) and a textfield where one can input the desired value. Advantage: Most flexible. Disadvantage: Having to type a value...

			<description>
		I had a discussion with someone on the Google Group for AntennaPod. I'm not quite sure why they're experiencing the issues they're seeing. If it's something to do with the device they're using or if this is a usability issue or some combination of the two. He seems frustrated enough that we should probably consider what is going on and think about how it could be addressed. I'm following up with the author to find out what device they're using. Tim: Sad enough that you had to switch from the play list to &quot;all episodes&quot; every time you launch the app for a few months now, the &quot;all episodes&quot; lists is now missing completely. If I want to listen to an episode now, I have to search 3 lists to find it. This makes this great app almost unusable. Additionally, you have to scroll very, very carefully now not to swype one of the episodes out of the list.
Please bring back the &quot;all episodes&quot; list or at least have a switch in the settings to turn it on. I was so glad I found a good podcast app, finally, I don't want to move all my podcasts again.
 Me: Hi Tim,

The All Episodes list is still around, it's just called 'New Episodes'.  'New Episodes' defaults to showing only those episodes that haven't been added to the queue.  However, you can click the little three dots and clear the option that says to show new episodes only.

I wonder if you're using the app in a way that is somehow different from how most other people are using it.  Most people add episodes to the queue and listen to them from there.  You can configure the app to do this for you automatically if you like.
 Tim Thanks for your answer. I tried to use the app the way you proposed now and add the episodes I want to listen to to the playlist, but this release seems to be extremely buggy. E.g.
- Some of my podcasts were in the playlist, some are not, I could not figure out what rule is behind this. So I decided to start from scracht und delete the episodes in the playlist to start with an empty one and add the episodes I plan to listen to. A few seconds after I emptied the list, more and more seemingly random episodes appeared in the list again. If I swype episodes away from the playlist, these exact same episode appear again in the list (happened 4 times with one episode) after a few seconds or minutes. The list is constantly filled up with random episodes - and the app seems to start downloading these random episodes after adding them to the list.
- If &quot;swyping away&quot; multiple episodes in a row, the app reproducibly crases
- Some of my podcasts are automatically downloaded, some are not, even though I have &quot;automatic download&quot; enabled for all podcasts (but this problem also existed in previous releases)
- If I download podcasts manually in the &quot;new eposodes&quot; list, they are not marked as downloaded after the download (at least in 90% of the cases) - so I don't know which one I already downloaded
- As already said, swyping is much more sensive than in any other app, which always makes you swype episodes away when scolling. Undoing the operation does not bring back the episode, at least not until changing to another list and then opening the first list again.
- Loading the list sometimes takes minutes - or maybe the process hangs somehow. I never experienced that with the previous releases.

Maybe going back to the last stable release and fixing the bugs beforde publishing the new release would be a good idea. I really appreciate the work you do for a good, free opensource app, but on my part I cannot really use the app in this condition.
 Me: Hmm. We honestly haven't had those problems (crashes, random downloads, etc...) and have received mostly positive feedback regarding this release.

However, I'm certainly concerned. I'll be sure to relay these concerns to the rest of the team and we'll see what we can do.

		I think we missed a major use case of 'All Episodes' From a recent play store review: All episodes listing removed No clue why it was removed, now I have to look at a list with barely visible episodes. The old listing was far better. Showed episodes and clearly showed what was new. Silly change for the sake of change. Nothing beneficial.
 The user from #741 also seemed to care quite a bit about 'All Episodes'. I think some users (not sure how many) weren't actually using the queue. They were just using All Episodes and playing things as they wished. Our changes disrupted their workflow significantly. We didn't notice this because we all play everything from the queue and thought of 'All Episodes' as a place to go simply to add things to the Queue. I'd like to suggest the following changes for a 1.1.1 release (based on the version_1.1 branch): Instead of defaulting to the Queue view, we should really just display the last fragment the user was looking at when the app closed We should probably decrease or remove the amount of fading that happens to 'read' episodes in the 'New Episodes' list We should see if there are any low risk ways to implement some of @heckler01's suggestions from #721 (if there's no easy way it can wait for a more major update) Thoughts?

		Sometimes I would like to control the order of episodes displayed. I might want to listen to the podcast from the first. Right now, I have to scroll all the way down to play each episode and this is especially a problem if there are a lot of episodes in the podcast. Could there be an option to control the order of podcasts by &quot;Date-Added&quot; or so on?

		From Google Play Can't see downloaded episodes Why did you remove the All Podcasts list? Once a podcast is downloaded, it is removed from the New Podcast list, and not added to my queue. Its hard to see what podcasts I have to listen to.
 So I wouldn't worry much about this, except that they say the that after the episode is downloaded it doesn't show up in the Queue. My guess is that they don't have auto add enabled. But that's definitely not good behavior. Once #748 is published his overall issue should go away, but the queue, at least for him, isn't working the way it should. We should take a look at this.

		I recently uploaded a release candidate of 1.1.1 to the Alpha channel for testing (you can also find it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7dyg37vi34gqunu/AntennaPod_1.1.1_release.apk?dl=0). This resolves some issues that were reported by users who missed the All Episodes view and used it instead of the Queue. All things considered this is a fairly minor change. But some feedback would be welcome before we push it out to production. Are there any other immediate changes we should include in 1.1.1? My hope is to get this out quickly to help out folks that are currently broken, but if anything is missing and straightforward we could include it now (or in a 1.1.2). Changelog: Version 1.1.1 All Episodes and New Episodes are now both present Remembers which activity was last active instead of always going to the Queue When adding a podcast the most recent episode is considered 'new'

		It would be nice if we prominently indicated which feeds failed to refresh. You can probably get this from the download log but something more in your face would be nice. An indicator on the Podcast itself in the Nav drawer perhaps? Taken from a play store comment: Stopped showing new podcasts Used to be good, but won't show which podcasts it has failed to refresh. Podcast Addict doesn't have this problem so will be using that from now on. Update: The app will not show me which podcasts have failed or succeeded to download. Podcast Addict shows that certain podcasts have new content, this app does not right now.

		It can make a mess of the crash reports. Yes, if we keep the mapping we could reproduce them. But is there any upside to obfuscating? We're an open source application. There's no IP to protect? I'm considering adding -dontobfuscate to proguard.cfg. Are there any reasons I shouldn't?

 This basically means that the events provided to onScroll are null. From onScroll: public boolean onScroll(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float distanceX, float distanceY) {

        final int x1 = (int) e1.getX();   // this is line 381
        final int y1 = (int) e1.getY();
        final int x2 = (int) e2.getX();
        final int y2 = (int) e2.getY();
 I don't think this is DSLV's 'fault', but it should be easy enough to fix.

		Sometimes when your connection is slow and you want to see which podcasts the app downloads. So you can decide if you want to stop the download. But often antennapod is not downloading anymore. And the notification only shows that the download has finished long ago. On devices with bigger screens it can be annoying to open the notification area for nothing.... You could alter the icon in the following way: Make the right arrow a bit shorter and add a dot between the arrows to indicate that the arrows don't go round and round but stopped at some point.

		I've been thinking that we have a bad user experience when you first subscribe to a podcast. Namely, you subscribe and then have to click back like 4 times to get to the main screen. It would be nice if when you subscribe it takes you to the subscribed podcast view (ItemListFragment), and then you don't have to navigate all those back buttons. This should make it much easier for people to interact with the podcast they just subscribed to.

		Hi, I would like to see a toggle option to have episodes deleted when swiped off the queue regardless of whether they are listened to or not. If that's not feasible a context menu option to delete the episode in addition to moving it up and remove it from the queue would be helpful. The way I use AntennaPod keeps me in the queue most of the time. That is where I play from (thank you for including direct playback from the queue) and organize my listening, so it would be great if I could delete episodes from there also.

		I use Tiny-Tiny RSS (a.k.a. TT-RSS) to manage my RSS feeds, including podcasts, but I generally prefer to use it as a backend for applications like Liferea on the desktop, which use TT-RSS's API to sync feeds. It'd be great if Antennapod could sync with TT-RSS similarly to the way it works with gpodder.net, with the ability to specify a particular folder/category within the TT-RSS tree as the root for podcasts and have new subscriptions added within Antennapod placed there, read/unread status updated as appropriate, etc. 👍 1

This could be shown in the side menu next to or on top of the Podcast image. Best example of this implementation is doggcatcher here with all podcasts showing unlistened to episodes and &quot;The Month Podcast&quot; also showing the in progress episodes

		There appears to be a small issue with the widget that when the current listening episode ends all the information updates for the next podcast except the time. What you get: podcast-new title
podcast-old time played / time total
 In the case of the time played and time total they are the same, eg 30:00 / 30:00 What you should get podcast-new title

		I would really like to see an option in AntennaPod to be able to set that all episodes older than 'n' days should be deleted. It could either be a sliding scale, or something like &quot;one week&quot;, &quot;two weeks&quot;, &quot;one month&quot;, six months&quot; or &quot;one year&quot;. It would of course be even better if you could set this on a per subscribed podcast basis.

		It would be great if a could put a quota in GB on the data folder. Therefore, if the storage space of all the downloaded episodes reach over this limit, the oldest ones will be deleted.

		1.1.2 fixed a problem with the gpodder.net certificate handling for 2.3 devices. We should merge that change in to 1.2. There will likely be a merge conflict when dealing with AndroidManifest.xml and about.html. We should probably just take the version of those files that are in develop.

		I've installed the latest version 1.1.2 from the PlayStore on both my mobile phone and my tablet and recieve connection errors with some feeds and when trying to connect to gpodder.net over wifi. With gpodder the following error message appears: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: failed to connect to gpodder.net/2605:2700:0:5::4713:9656 (port 443) after 30000ms Many feeds are working fine, but for these I get a similar error message: http://blog.ct.de/ctuplink/ctuplink.rss https://netzpolitik.org/category/netzpolitik-podcast/feed/ http://stimmen.univie.ac.at/feed/mp3 http://www.jungundnaiv-podcast.de/feed/mp3 http://feeds.feedburner.com/sowiradio?format=xml http://chaosradio.ccc.de/chaosradio-latest.rss http://cre.fm/feed/mp3/ The error messages always include IPv6 adresses and read like this failed to connect to cre.fm/2a01:a380:4408:a001::30 (port 80) after 30000ms The error does only occur over wifi. When trying to connect to gpodder or downloading feeds via mobile data connections everything is working fine. The issue also had appeared in the last version by the way. Thanks in advance!

		I noticed when there is 1 download remaining, the notification still says &quot;1 Downloads Left&quot;. Not &quot;1 Download Left&quot;. Not a big deal, but thought I would point it out in case nobody had noticed it yet. Love the application! I'm using a Nexus 4 with Android 5.1 in English, but it looks like this is language and version-independent.

		Hi Thanks for this app. It does the job for me except that I am confused about what I have listened and finished. It seems to me that there is no way to differentiate finished, marked as read etc from regular casts. For example I mark one mp3 as read but in the list it does not look any different. I can see that ones I dowloaded have a play icon. But that is the most visible identification that I can tell. I hope it makes sense. thanks

		Hi everyone, We're getting ready to release version 1.2 of AntennaPod and would appreciate it if people would take it for a spin. It should show up in the Alpha channel if you're enrolled (https://plus.google.com/communities/117446128636140585144) Otherwise you can download and run it manually here debug or release. Please let us know what you think or if you experience any problems. Thanks!

		I ran in to a deadlock issue when testing 1.2 build 53 on my HTC One M7 running 5.0.2. It started when playback was getting interrupted by navigation. Some of the interruptions worked and then eventually playback just never resumed. Eventually I hooked it up to adb logcat and was able to see it generate the traces.txt file. The entire time it was locked it was printing lots of these messages: 05-23 16:38:10.624: D/PlayerWidgetService(1653): Service was called while updating. Ignoring update request
 I think this may be due to this change where the tryLock() was changed to a lock(). Here is a dump of the thread traces

		When listening at higher speed than 1x, tail of the clip is being cut off. It's always a small amount of time -- but at a high speed, it's not negligible. Example clip: http://www.npr.org/2015/05/26/409673364/artist-makes-money-off-other-peoples-instagram-photos 1x cuts off the last word 2.3x cuts off last 2 sentences Notes: I listen to podcasts at up to 2.3x speed

		Currently playing clips are usually OK, but if the next one comes up -- the app frequently stops playing (and often can't start back up) until the BT headset is disconnected. When disconnected, next clip can be played and if BT headset is connected while playing, everything is fine. Notes: Does not stop on every clip transition. Some clips refuse to start playing via BT headset almost 100% of the time (different podcast/filetype??) I usually listen at up to 2.3x speed, but switching down to 1.0 doesn't seem to help much. Possibly unrelated: sometimes &quot;Prestissimo has stopped&quot; error pops up, then the clip starts playing at 1.0x speed (and speed controls become unavailable until playback is paused)

		An item that has been deactivated and reactivated download won't be auto-downloaded. How to reproduce this: Wait for an item to be downloading (or delete the download to force it). Cancel download. The app will disable auto-download for the item. Reenable auto-download for the item. Delete next downloaded episodes. Wait for download (or force it, by disabling and reenabling wifi). Expected result: The reenabled item should download Actual result: Following items would be downloaded instead Version. 1.2 build 54.

		Running: AntennaPod 1.1.2 on CyanogenMod CM11 M11 and a Galaxy S4. AntennaPod is set up so that podcast episodes must be manually downloaded Issue: If I have at least two new podcast episodes in my download list, downloading the 2nd after the first causing the error unfortunately antennapod has stopped and AntennaPod to restart If I have a number of new episodes, for example 3, available in my queue for downloads. podcast1_e12 podcast2_e05 podcast3_e634 I start to download these new episodes first pressing the download icon for podcast1_e12. The download begins, I then click the download icon for podcast2_e05. As soon as I do this AntennaPod crashes/restarts with error unfortunately antennapod has stopped. The crash is always on the 2nd podcast in the list and no others (largest sample to date is 4). However if I try and download them in any other order than 1, 2, 3 the download works fine. If I do it in any order other than 1, 2, 3 and then cancel all downloads I am then able to download in order 1, 2, 3 with out a crash.

		I listened to the podcast Glaubenssache in Februar without problems. Now i can not update the stream. Via Wifi (my DSL ipv6) i had the error &quot;gzip finished without exhausting source&quot;, with UMTS i had &quot;failed to connect to... after 30000 ms&quot;. What ever. For testing i deleted the podcast and tried to readd it: Now i have &quot;gzip finished without exhausting source&quot; with both network connections via iTunes search and the timeout for this direct feed: http://glaubenssache.info/feed/mp3/

		I see this issue in the French locale, not sure if this plays in other locales. The text &quot;Move to the top of the list&quot; says &quot;Move to the top of top of the list&quot; (&quot;Déplacer vers le haut de haut de la liste&quot;): It should be &quot;Déplacer vers le haut de la liste&quot;. Note that the string &quot;Move to the bottom of the list&quot; is displayed just fine. Ii wasn't able to find this string in Transifex, is this maybe an Android issue?

		I'm currently going mad with this. I can't find anything related to this in issues: in my Samsung Galaxy S4, it's almost impossible to swipe off tracks from queue when in portrait mode. The movement must be long enough and, many times, it fails.

		I have subscribed Logbuch Netzpolitk http://feeds.feedburner.com/logbuch-netzpolitik mp3 feed via gpodder.net, then downloaded an episode and start to play it. Everything work, but I can't forward any episode. When I use the forward button the episode jumps to the beginning. Same is happening when I type on any position of the track (line). A delete and afterwards resubscribe doesn't have any difference. It's not working. Device: GT-I9505 (Samsung Galaxy S4) Software: CyanogenMod 12.1 Android: 5.1.1 AndennaPod: 1.1.2 EDIT Streaming of an episode works. The issue appears only with downloaded episodes.

		It would be useful to see, artist, bitrate etc. (edit: title is already displayed in action bar). I think it could be added to the bottom of the description so that the UI for playing podcasts and playing back other media files would be similar. Or, bury it behind the overflow menu, but in this case white screen is often wasted.

		Hi, I have only recently begun to experiment with AntennaPod, but I like it so far. This is more of a question than a bug report maybe. I'm wondering about the skip button and the auto delete behavior. I am on the Google play version 1.1.2 and I download episodes manually so far. I understand that there's a cache where episodes go after I listened to them and the oldest gets deleted from there once it's full. Or do all episodes go there once I download them and they delete no matter whether I ever listened to them? Is there a way to list all episodes that I have currently downloaded? Does the cache only work with auto-downloading? The auto-delete after playback option is in addition to the cache, isn't it? #111 talks about a skip button in relation to auto-deleting. This is exactly the behavior that I am looking for. However, the skip button is just not there on my phone. Or I cannot spot it :) The notification area only shows play / pause. What's the easiest way to get to the next episode? Kind regards, Matthias Kauer

		Now that 1.2 is released it's time to start thinking about 1.3. There have been some suggestions for major UI improvements. Some visible, some under the covers. I think it would make sense to think through all the GUI related features and changes we want and try to make them all work well together. Some thoughts on improvements: Material design overhaul Use of RecyclerView in place of DSLV New subscription view (#848, #836) Better sharing of episodes (#861) Display of itunes 'explicit' tags (#724) Filtering by itunes 'explicit' tags (#725) Support for multiple queues I don't think this will happen in 1.3 Improve visibility of adding podcasts via iTunes - Done This is really the easiest way of adding podcasts Perhaps making it the first option users see and only labeling it 'search'? Download all episodes from a feed (#871, #520) Episode forward/back (#732) I bet there are some other good thoughts on what could be done. We should think hard about any changes to how we interact with the app, how these features would change them and how they could all work together.

		On my Nexus 4 and 7 (both running Cyanogenmod 12.1 nightly) I've noticed that downloading of feeds and episodes causes unusual high memory usage. It's increasing with the number of downloads in parallel but the used memory is not assigned to AntennaPod itself but seems to be used by the android system. While &quot;system&quot; is used to use around 300 MB on my Nexus 7 when idle, it's increasing to 750 MB while downloading 3 episodes and to more than 1.1 GB when downloading 10. Sometimes the used system memory stays at 800 MB, even after the downloads are finished and AntennaPod was killed using a task killer. I could reproduce this behaviour after reinstalling (only imported my previously created OPML file). In Version 1.1.2 the memory usage is perfectly normal so I'm now back on this version.

		Since upgrading to 1.2, switching between all the views (single feeds, the queue, …) in the sidebar takes a long time (10 sec to ~3 min), during which the blue rotating circle icon is displayed. When switching to another view and back again, it takes the same time again. I subscribe to ~20 feeds and have downloaded 3.35 GB of episodes. What can I do to help you debug this? There's nothing in logcat. I'm on Android 5.1.1.

		Hi there, after restoring my subscriptions from gpodder after a fresh antenna install my feeds don't have pictures any more. On the left in the action bar (is it called that?) I have the list of podcasts only with a name, not with a picture. see attachment : . The same in the new episodes tab. just names of new episodes, not the picture of the corresponding feed. If I add a new feed it works with the picture and all (see the empire podcast above). Is there a way to manually update the pictures or what do I have to do? Thanks

		Hi, I'm no contributer to AntennaPod, but simply a single user observing some issues with the newest version of AntennaPod. The update was done automatically within my Wiko Rainbow (Android 4.4.2) at 16.06. First of all thank you for this marvellous piece of software. I'm that glad to have it as no other podcast-player on Android is that simple, minimalistic, stable and focused. With the newest update from 16.06.2015 I observe a significant delay in displaying the episodes-lists, the played list, the podcasts themselves, etc. The feature showing the unlistened episodes on the right side of the podcasts is great, however it looks like all the changes have changed the speed of the application overall. Showing the playing list with 321 entries needs more than 20 seconds. Potentially a problem with the length of the list as after deletion of the playing list things are fine again. However adding a podcast-episode to the playing list by using the context menu lasts ~10-15 seconds. Opening a podcast-overview lasts 2-3 seconds. That's definitely longer than before. Not dramatic, but new. But the most significant problem I observed first today having no internet connection at all. I have downloaded all the episodes and placed them in the playing list. Opening the playing list lasted approx. 40-50 seconds. Jumping back and opening one of the podcasts directly was not possible, no episodes were displayed. From my perspective AntennaPod seems to unusable if there's no internet connection even the episodes are downloaded. I could not observe this behaviour with the previously installed version. Perhaps you can use these details for further improvement. With a heavy heart I will have to search for another podcast-player. Ciao, Georg

		Moto G 4G Android 5.1/4.4.4 AntennaPod: 1.2 23 Podcasts on external SD class 10 After the upgrade to AntennaPod 1.2 loading the different Views like &quot;all episodes&quot; take quite long (20 sec). It only happens if you switch between different views. Switching from App to Home Screen doesn't force it to reload. I didn't have this problem with 1.x. Loading times were way shorter.

		Hi I realize AntennaPod is geared towards audio but would not hurt is audio streaming from a video streaming is possible with it. Basicaly it will just play audio from a video stream if possible. The reason I am bringing it up because it might be cheaper from the batter usage perspective maybe?

		The per podcast new episode count shown in the side menu doesn't go down/ disappear after downloading the new episodes, whereas it does for the all new episodes count on the New Episodes button. Edit: This issue should be labelled as bug, but I can't for the life of me find where to do so. Edit 2: This not-disappearing-of-counts started in I think version 1.2, and it hasn't fixed the existing miscounts in updating to 1.2.1, but I don't know yet if it still miscounts in 1.2.1.

		In the side menu, there are buttons for the Queue, all the individual podcast subscriptions and the settings, among other things. Through some voodoo witchcraft navigation, it is possible to be in the window of a subscription, and when clicking on the Queue button, not going to the Queue instead staying in that subscription. I don't have a consistent way of arriving at this yet, but these are the approximate steps: Start at Queue Go to a subscription's page ???. Navigate to some pages that have back arrows in the top left Also, use the android back button not the app's one At some point, use the home screen to go to the android home page, and relaunch the app using the app icon Through some combination of the ??? above, you end up at the subscription's page but clicking the Queue button won't take you to the Queue, leaving you stuck at the subscription's page until you go to New Episodes or something like that

		In previous versions, the podcast icon seemed to always be scaled up to the full width of the phone when in 'playback view' (where you only really see the podcast you're playing and have all the playback controls). Now, some podcasts have really small icons in the middle, which I suppose means they aren't high-res enough to fill the entire screen. If this was a deliberate choice so be it, but I preferred it the old way so here's hoping it's accidental :)

		I like the long pressing on Queue, New Episodes, etc. to add/remove those to the nav drawer. I think the same long press should do something for the subscriptions, like giving you a menu to unsubscribe.

		When you go to a podcast subscription from the navigation drawer, and tap the little 'i' thing you get a page with information about the subscription. Among other things, it has the URL of the feed. This URL if longer than the width of the area for it, won't continue on the next line and instead just disappear off screen.

		When the podcast at the bottom of the Queue finishes playing, a message appears at the bottom saying &quot;Item Removed Undo&quot; where pressing the Undo returns the podcast to the Queue. This only happens for the bottom Queue item, perhaps because for the others there is always a bar with play button for the next episode at the bottom. Either this message should be removed entirely, or appear consistently at the end of every podcast, right now it seems like a built-in feature accidentally left on. How to replicate: Add podcast to Queue Play it Go to playback controls and drag time to end of podcast AP goes back to Queue and shows &quot;Item Removed&quot; message.

		If you play a podcast in the Queue and the next item in the Queue is not downloaded, when the playback ends the playback controls view doesn't go away if it was open, instead just showing playback controls that don't do anything and no cover. Furthermore, the bottom Now Playing/Play-pause bar shows the episode that just finished with the pause button. How to replicate: Put downloaded podcast in Queue Put not downloaded podcast in Queue right below the previous one Play first podcast Go to playback controls and drag playback timer to end of file Playback controls are blank (problem part 1) Go back to Queue Bottom bar shows just finished podcast (problem part 2)

		The most recent release of AntennaPod seems to have a bug that has been fixed. Last December I reported incorrect dates on a podcast in issue #545, this was fixed correctly when the issue was closed. With the newest release I am seen the exact same failure mode as was reported in that issue. From that issue: It is the podcast for &quot;Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast&quot;. Every time I add the feed it thinks every podcast is today. The next day when I updated the feed it increments the day and shows every podcast as today.

		Often use this app while driving and have my phone mounted on the dash. Play / pause, forward, rewind controls however are small and hard to access use while in this view. Propose that while in the episode player view have a slide up gesture added to the bottom control bar so that it makes that control bar take up 50-60% of the screen and finger swipe down to make back to normal.

		Now that AntennaPod isn't being maintained by @danieloeh any longer and a team of people are working on it, Daniel, mentioned that he felt we should change who the Flattr money goes to. After discussing with Daniel and @mfietz we decided that we should remove the ability to flattr the app. The reason being that since the team is split up, there's no one person who the money should go to. At the moment we have no expenses (apart from time). So there really isn't a great way to deal with the revenue Flattr was providing. We are, of course, very pleased that people like the app enough to donate. We just don't know how to deal with those funds justly, and as a result felt it would be better to remove the ability to Flattr AntennaPod directly. This should resolve #507 and #567 as we just won't support accepting money any longer. If people have a better idea of what to do, please share it here.

			<description>
		AP keeps resurrecting (downloading and adding to the queue) episodes I have listened to. The resurrected episodes get added as new ones come out in the same feed. At one point the queue was completely empty, the next day I had the new episodes released that day, plus the previous one for each of those feeds. I have auto refresh on every 4th hour, along with autodowload/queue. When long-pressing on the episodes I have the option to mark them as unplayed, so I'm assuming AP remembers I've listened to them, or marked them as played/skipped (difference?) before. Marking then as unplayed gives me the option to play them. All the files exist on the device and I can play them immediately and I don't have the option to stream them. When I notice this, I have to go into each episode, tap to remove the file, wait for the file to be removed, tap to remove it from the queue, back out, wait a while until the episode disappears from the queue (takes several seconds, if it even works), and hope they don't come back again. Sorting the queue while doing this can get really interesting as it randomly ressurrects episodes I just removed too. I have a Samsung S3 GT-I9300 with Cyanogenmod 12.1 and I'm currently in the alpha/beta program.

Autodownload was activated in settings and for all respective podcasts. Downloading each individual episode manually one after the other worked.

		Hi If I wanted to implement continuous playback by default - NOT VIA THE QUEUE. User selects the latest podcast and plays it, when done it moves to the next item what would be the easiest way to do this? We are creating an App with one podcast preloaded and preventing adding further. Adding to the queue does not make sense due to the nature of the audio, where some are 30 seconds and goes to the next item. Forcing the user to put audio into a queue would have to be repeated each time they used the app. So, on playing the latest it should move to the next item downwards. Any ideas?

		Hi This is a feature request for being able to play episodes with external apps that are installed on the system. For example my preferred player is Aimp for offline media. This kind of media passing is pretty common in other apps like file managers, media managers etc. I do not mean to recommend a replacement replacement player, I am merely asking as a way to &quot;share&quot; the location of the media on the disk to another local player when the user wants. thanks

I even deleted the images and refreshed APod(which redownloaded all the images), however that does not seem to help with gaining icons back. No shows no episodes have icons.

		Since my Moto X (1st Gen) finally got its update to Android 5.1 (first Android 5.x for this device) I do not have the media controls on my wearable Moto360 that I had when my phone was running Kitkat. In fact I see nothing of AntennaPod on my watch. The missing controls on my wearable are Play/Pause and Volume control. This might has something to do with the new MediaSession API.

		I believe this is caused by a race condition. The item is removed from the list before getItem is called. We could solve this by just checking the index in getItem before returning, but that could still cause a race condition. Better would be to see if we should be operating on a copy of the list, synchronizing access to it somehow, or using a better method of identifying downloads. java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 7, size is 7

			<description>
		The course of events is somewhat complicated, so here is everything in chronological order: My phone is an LG Optimus G (e975), running Cyanogenmod. This device has no sd card slot, external storage is emulated at /storage/emulated/0. It was running Cyanogenmod 11 (Android 4.4 iirc) and AntennaPod 1.1.2. I didn't encounter any of the issues below then. As CM 12 became available I upgraded to that version, upgrading the Google Apps in the process. Soon later I noticed AntennaPod wasn't updating feeds properly, a new episode wasn't shown even after manual refresh, though it was clearly in the feed. Using paged feeds also didn't work, the &quot;v&quot; button was shown, but pressing it yielded no results after loading was done. I noticed AntennaPod's version on F-Droid (1.1.2) was outdated, so I reinstalled 1.2 from Google Play. Starting AntennaPod results in the error: No external storage is available . Please make sure that external storage is mounted so that the app can work proplerly. Rebooting, removing cache and data, reinstalling, disabling PrivacyGuard didn't fix it. Best part: Reinstalling 1.1.2 from F-Droid now also yields the “No external storage is available” message. Despite all this, it's nice to see the latest progress!

		Hello, I previously opened #796 requesting the addition of an uplayed count in the Nav bar which was added. However there were some strange UX choices added which I'd like to see if they can be changed. Prior to this feature being added, the podcast list in the navbar was sorted alphabetically, these was optimal as you always knew where a particular podcast was in the list. Once the unplayed count was added to the navbar it appears to have changed the sort order of the podcasts. This looks to be sorted now as 1) most unlistened, then 2) alphabetically. This gives a terrible user experience as you have to pay a lot more attention to the list as there is guarantee a podcast will be listed where you expect it. Can this be changed back to just doing it alphabetically while keeping the unplayed count?

		Not sure if this would be the right place to discuss this, but is it possible that some developers take over the &quot;AntennaPodSP&quot; (https://github.com/danieloeh/AntennaPodSP) and update that version as well? I see that AntennaPod is updated frequently which is very good, but the other is almost one year without any update and there is no response from the original developer who forked the project. thanks

		As discussed in #441 The feeds were changed from alphabetical to number of unplayed episodes. Is it possible to make it an option? The two ways I use antennapod are affected by this: Listening to podcasts on demand: me or a friend have a specific feed that we want to listen to, so we want to pull up the feed, see if there are any new episodes or old episodes that we haven't listened to. Queuing up a small percentage of subscribed podcasts. I know some other people personally who are the same way. Detail from my previous post: I have a limited amount of time available to listen to podcasts compared to the amount of subjects and podcasts I'm interested in. Most of my feeds have a large amount of unplayed new episodes, but that tag is still useful to me: Subscribe to a large list of podcasts of various subjects (from educational to comedy to career-specific) Select a small amount of feeds to auto-download Add specific episodes to the queue (or for direct streaming) via description Let queue auto-download when on wifi Step 3 is of course what is affected by this: &quot;New Episodes&quot; tab mixes all the topics together low-frequency feeds can get lost amongst higher-frequency feeds. Static alphabetical view of podcast feeds allows quick access by subject or feed tagging may work as well as I saw in another thread, but one feed may be lighthearted or heavy on the same subject, where selecting individual feeds is still useful to me Unplayed tag still useful (in case marking all as read sorts it alphabetically) old unplayed podcasts are useful if I've exhausted my queue for that subject I'm open to suggestions in a better process for the same use case with the update. As the setting depends on your use case (which doesn't usually change), it should not be on the main UI, but rather somewhere in the settings, where I personally don't think it would be considered clutter.

		Imagine you drive in your car and hear some interesting things in a podcast that you like to google later, because you want to read more background information to a specific part of the episode that were not provided in the podcast itself. I would love to have a button which will create an entry with the playback time and the name of the podcast-episode which was played. This would give me the possibility to hear the minutes around the &quot;bookmarks&quot; again after I arrived at home.

		As you can see from the screenshot, quite a few episodes say &quot;0 B&quot; instead of their actual weight. The screenshot was taken some time ago, but right now I'm using v 1.2.1, Build 58 from F-droid and seeing it on episodes from Freakonomics Radio, TED Radio Hour and Note to self (previously New Tech City). I do not see it on the one episode of Planet Money that I have downloaded right now, even though the episode I had when I took the screenshot was affected. I don't know why there's a difference.

		When you're looking at the info for an episode and press the Download button, the progress bar pushes the buttons down, as you can see here: It would be a lot better if the progress bar showed up bellow the buttons, so that they're not moved. Two more things: Should the Stream button still be there after you've started the download? The Cancel download icon is missing a piece on the left side.

		Hi We have around 65 feeds and I was looking at having an android developer fork your code and then pre-load, if so what would be the best way for him/her to do this? The reason I want this is, is so they can keep up to date with your feature set and merge them into our version. I don't want them to make any enhancements or anything. Note, we will NOT be selling the app. Kind Regards

		Hi! There are problems when a video episode ends. The episode ends and gets deleted (if configured). But the next episode in the playlist is not being played after that. Pressing play for the next episode has no effect. Only killing and restarting the app helps. Playing the playlist should be continuous, no matter if video or audio. It seems there are some problems returning from the video player, as it pauses only when a video episode ends.

		With the latest version (1.2.1) I do have some playback problems which result in an error-message. This happens out of thin air when podcasts from opus feed are played. Especially when using chapter-marks or fast-forward to jump to a specific part in the podcast. I observed this with the following podcast: http://feeds.feedburner.com/freakshow/opus http://www.staatsbuergerkunde-podcast.de/feed/opus-rss/ To use AntennaPod again I have to force stop it. I'm using CM12.1 Nightlies on an OnePlus One.

		All items in the &quot;recently listened&quot; view are grey. I guess grey text implies that the episode is not new and the user listened to it. The problem is with the dark theme the contrast of grey text on dark grey background is a bit low. And it does not make any sense to indicated if something was listened in a view that implies that all its elements aren't new.

		I would suggest a change: On manual feed update AND episodes are ready to download AND on battery AND &quot;Download when not charging&quot; prefs is NOT set Antennapod should ask the user: New episode could be downloaded, but you are on battery. 
[download], [download always], [no]
 I tend to forget the reason why the download is not performed, so a manual update should override the prefs or inform me about this situation.

		Hi The current search results page is in thumbnails views which is fine but most of the time the titles and names etc are cutoff which makes it hard to see what the podcast is about. Sometimes the icons for the podcasts are generic which makes it harder to recognize what is going on. This might not be an issue with searches with couple results but when the search results return tens of results it makes it a tedious job to go into the details one by one to see what the podcast is about. thanks

		When I miss a word or two it often annoys me that I have to rewind by 30 seconds and listen again to what I've just heard. In other apps I figured that 15 second would the best fit for me (and when I feel like I missed more than a word I can rewind twice.) Can you please add an option to adjust the delta time to skip?

		An option to change playback speed to a lower (when listening to foreign language or otherwise difficult podcasts) or higher (easy listening) setting would be very appreciated. This could probably be integrated in the interface by adding a button on the right of the playback controls in the player view, which would trigger a pop-up menu with available speeds, Youtube-style, or a separate pop-up with a slider. However, a brief search reveals that the Android API by default does not include a functionality to change playback speed. See this Android issue and also this SO question. So this FR will probably have to sit here for quite a while, unless someone decides to re-implement variable playback rate, or Google suddenly releases an update. I might have been mistaken though, as I am poorly familiar with the details of Android development, so someone should look into whether this is actually impossible with the current API.

		(Please advise where you would prefer I post requests for information if this is the wrong place) It seems strange to call it &quot;All Episodes&quot; when it specifically does not show all episodes. What is the reason for this? I want to update the All Episodes fragment to show all the episodes in a feed. It seems relatively simple - just change the value of RECENT_EPISODES_LIMIT to a large number. Are there concerns I should know about when doing this? It must have been set at some point for a reason, but I can't find reference in the code about it.

		When subscribing to a new feed, only the first episode of the feed gets marked as &quot;new&quot;. This is apparent with only 1 item on the New episodes list, and only the top item of the All episodes list as well as the feed list showing &quot;NEW&quot;. Is there background on this, or another issue already logged? I was unable to find a duplicate. Fixing this is on the backlog for my customer so I should be able to feed that up onto this repo at some point.

		For some reason I cannot get AntennaPod to load the second to nth page of the following feeds: http://feeds.feedburner.com/mobile-macs-podcast http://cre.fm/feed/mp3 http://logbuch-netzpolitik.de/feed/mp3 http://newz-of-the-world.com/feed/mp3 When I press on the next page button for the first time after opening a feed list, the UI jumps to the top of the list, when I press the button a second time, the UI just briefly shows the loading circle and then nothing happens. Please have a look at this issue because it is rather annoying not to be able to listen to podcast episodes which were published before a certain date.

		I noticed that the folder &quot;files/images&quot; in the directory of AntennaPod was about 1,5 GB with over 2000 files. Is this normal? I have about 100 different podcast feeds and about 70 items (about 1 GB) in my queue at the moment. I deleted the folder because I was running out of space, but after updating the podcast feeds in the last several days only a few podcasts have regained their pictures. Is there a way to reload all pictures? I use Cyanogenmod 7 (I think) with Android 2.3.7 and have the newest version of AntennaPod.

		When going to a podcast feed and then doing anything from downloading an episode, marking it as unplayed, or simply going out of antennapod with the home button and then going back to it through the view-all-open-apps button, it resets the scroll position to the top. It only does this once for each time you open a feed view. Replication steps: Go to a podcast feed view Scroll down Start downloading an episode Result: feed view seems to reload, and snap back to the top Optional extra steps: Scroll down again Download other episode Result: now feed view doesn't snap back to top anymore Alternates for step 3: &quot;alt-tabbing&quot; out of antennapod and back in, marking episode as unplayed

		Removing an episode is sometimes not very permanent. For example, explicitly removing an episode that is in the queue, and then hitting refresh on the queue will immediately download the episode again. My gut feeling is that an explicit request to remove an episode should be permanent until an explicit request to reverse that state, which I believe is achieved by automatically marking as no auto download. Version 1.2.1 build 58.

		On previous installed version I had auto download enabled in settings (disabled for three feeds), no WiFi filtering. After installing the alfa I at first didn't change any settings, two days later I hadn't received any new podcasts (at this time I didn't check if any new episodes where available, but given the release schedule of my subscriptions there should have been some) so I went into the settings and checked to see if automatic download was still enabled, it was, I also set a download time (2 am). Today, two days later, I still hadn't gotten any new episodes so I went into each podcast feed (from the sidebar) and refreshed the feeds. It found 12 new episodes and the automatic download started.

		I had added raumzeit podcast from Tim pritlove yesterday while on mobile. Removed the auto download directly after adding. Now (&gt;30h after disabling) Antennapod fetched the newest episode. I don't think I was at wifi before. But why did that happen? Was it in a queue from adding the feed and waiting for wifi? I am not sure if this is related to #1009

			<description>
		There's been some confusion recently about when things get auto downloaded and when they get cleaned up. Part of this is from actual bugs and part of it is because the functionality is just plain confusing. The problem is that changing the behavior may break some users' workflows. Some might say that those users' workflows should be broken, but it's probably wiser to find a solution that can make everyone happy. To do that I'd like to propose a new workflow that will likely become the default, but give users the choice to retain the old one. AutoDownload and Queuing AutoDownload will download and add to the queue all items which are 'New' and have auto-download enabled (e.g. it will still support disabling downloads for individual feeds). It currently downloads any unread items. An item is new if it hasn't been acted on in some way. All new items show up in 'New Episodes' currently. This essentially makes New Episodes the list of items that will be downloaded the next time auto download is activated. While we think we have #1009 under control with the auto-download flag, this change would certainly have helped with it too. Cleanup Cleanup will consider any item that isn't currently in the queue as eligible for deletion. Currently an item has to be fully played and not in the queue for it to be deleted. Items won't get deleted immediately, but the next time AntennaPod needs space it will remove items that aren't queued. This will resolve the problem of having new items but them not being downloaded because you simply removed an item you didn't care about from the queue. Currently to make room for an item you have to mark the item as read and remove it from the queue, or go to 'Downloads' and remove it there. Which is more complicated than needs to be. This change to cleanup should resolve #939, #699. Enhancements Some users like to keep episodes after they've already listened to them. We could add (either now or as a future enhancement) a 'Favorites' capability (something that's been requested a number of other times). Items that are 'favorited' won't be deleted by the cleanup algorithm. (#538, wouldn't quite be as full featured as #851, but that would be more complicated to handle from a 'don't delete this' standpoint and take more time to implement) We might want to update what makes an item appear new. With this system an item added to the queue will never be new. A user might want to be able to see what new things have been downloaded and added the queue. Not sure what would be a good way to indicate that. Finally, we might want to add some ability to remove stale items from the queue. User can ask to bulk remove everything older than 7 days or something to that effect. Transition I think the user should be allowed to choose between this and the 'classic' algorithm, but I would like this to be the default in the future since I think it makes far more sense. So there's a question of how to transition without having people that would prefer classic lose all their episodes. I'd propose the following (though I'm not sure it's the best idea). For new installs, we just default to this new algorithm. But, if the user is upgrading, on the first launch of the app we ask the user if they want to switch to the queue centric model that allows for easier management of automatic downloads and easier cleanup of old episodes. If they prefer they can stick with classic which downloads more things and requires more interaction to clean up old episodes. Implementation We'd create a new EpisodeCleanupAlgorithm and a new AutomaticDownloadAlgorithm. Choosing the new mode would use those algorithms instead of APCleanupAlgorithm and APDownloadAlgorithm. Thoughts Any thoughts or opinions? Any other related issues I missed?

		I have a new podcast with many old episodes (i never heard before). One episode seems interesting after start reading its description so i click the &quot;download&quot; button. This starts downloading but throws me into the feed view (unwanted behaviour 1 as i was reading the description). Even the scroll position is lost, so i have to scroll down again to this old episode. While further reading the description my WiFi failed and so the download stops. But again i was thrown into the feed view (unwanted behaviour 2). Thanks for all your work with this software. I use them every day on my way from and to work. Cycling would be so boring without :-)

		With the growth of the project, the current license is probably no longer sufficient as it leaves much unclear and not explicit. For example, it asks for the copyright notice to be included, but doesn't say anything about whether forked code should disclose source code or not (relevant comment) It's probably a good idea for the community or maintainers to discuss/decide on a more appropriate and comprehensive license. A good summary of popular licenses is available here. Some of the more popular licenses are listed here (scroll down). An alternative listing of popular licenses is available here.

		After I updated the app today it is saturating my downlink. So far it has downloaded over 1 GB. It doesn't download any podcasts as far as I can see. Nothing in the download log either. What kind of stuff is it downloading? Over 1 gig of stuff. I have all updates set to manual since forever. Thanks.

		As there are quite a few strings that haven't been translated to Dutch I am working on that in Transifex. I have the app open in front of me so that I can check for the right context. In order to determine the the proper translation of 'Set subscription counter' (pref_nav_drawer_feed_counter_title) and the other counter items, I was wonder what the function (Setting the subscription counter) actually does: A) determine the displayed number in the drawer B) determine the numbers for the counter (the &quot;set subscription order&quot; setting 'sort by counter') and thus the order of the feeds if 'sort by counter' is selected C) both I would expect it's C) both, but from the english strings I would read differently, as the description of the &quot;Set subscription counter&quot; currently is: &quot;Change the information displayed by the subscription counter&quot;

		From the play store: Downloads already played episodes For the past week, seeing already played episodes in my queue. (Says so when I press on the episode) e.g. NPR Hourly News from 06-05-2015 and 06-15-2015 Have to delete the file and ep from queue every time. I'm not sure why this would be happening. I've subscribed to that feed so we'll see if I see the same behavior. Sharing this link back to the play store to get more feedback. Device reported as: L-01F (g2)

		Hello, Today I did not use my Phone and the battery went from 80% to 10% in a few hours. A look in Wakelock Detector told me that my Phone was active all the time. AntennaPod (more exactly: com.aocate.media.ServiceBackedMediaPlayer) prevented the CPU from sleeping for 93% of the up time (since 1d and a few hours)! During this period I was in flight mode, did not listen to any episode and nothing was paused, either. So AntennaPod should have been (almost) completely inactive. After I forced AntennaPod to exit the battery stayed at 10% for 3 hours :) I use CyanogenMod 12.1 and AntennaPod 1.3.1.

		I synced with my gpodder.net account, which included several subscriptions that no longer have active RSS feeds. It seems that since AntennaPod has never successfully downloaded the feed, it doesn't appear in the subscription list, so I can't remove the dead subscription. I have unsubscribed via gpodder.net, but AntennaPod doesn't seem to be syncing the removal of a subscription. As a result, every time I refresh my podcasts, I get errors for four RSS feeds that I don't have listed in my subscriptions. Also, is there a way to get to the download history / error log from inside the app?

		This has been reported on Google Play in a couple of spots now. I'm not entirely sure why we're seeing this now but weren't before. The simple solution is to check everything for null first, but it would be better to know why it's null in the first place. First example: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to read from field 'android.view.View android.widget.AdapterView$AdapterContextMenuInfo.targetView' on a null object reference

		Hi, I'm subscribed to Radio Berkman: http://feeds.feedburner.com/radioberkman When I resume playing an episode after closing AntennaPod, it resumes playing at a point different than the point it was paused. If I seek within an episode using the slider, it displays one time for a fraction of a second, then displays another time as it starts playing back. If I seek using the Forwards and Backwards buttons, it doesn't seek by 30 seconds. Sometimes seeking using the Backwards button will cause it to seek forwards. When I open the episodes using Totem on my computer, the duration doesn't match the duration shown by AntennaPod. Matt

		Occurred 5 times on a LG Spirit running Android 5.0. I think this is because PreferenceActivity.MainFragment is created before PreferenceActivity.onCreate is called, resulting in PreferenceActivity.instance being null. This seems like a very strange setup for PreferenceActivity. Any idea why it was setup this way @mfietz ? java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{de.danoeh.antennapod/de.danoeh.antennapod.activity.PreferenceActivity}: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to read from field 'de.danoeh.antennapod.preferences.PreferenceController de.danoeh.antennapod.activity.PreferenceActivity.preferenceController' on a null object reference

(really just remove the 'new' mark?) I am not aware of an option to manually mark items as 'seen' (i.e. removing the 'new' status, applying 'unplayed' status); but only to mark items as 'played'.

		I've seen a couple of these in the play store now. If I had to guess media.getDownload_url() is returning null or an empty string. Kind of hard to tell because we're not getting much help from the stack trace. Perhaps adding the onError handler would help? java.lang.IllegalStateException: Exception thrown on Scheduler.Worker thread. Add `onError` handling.

		Even when I've pre-downloaded all the podcasts in my queue and disabled mobile data updates, AntennaPod still seems to be using plenty of data during my commutes as I listen. I have auto-downloading completely disabled and I manually queue and download each podcast while on WiFi. Just in the last 12 hours since I installed a network monitor, AntennaPod has downloaded 39.05MB on mobile data (63.14MB on WiFi, which would account for one downloaded podcast). During the same timeframe, Prestissimo has used 114.68MB on mobile and 19.55MB on WiFi, which could be another matter, though this is the only app I have that uses Prestissimo. I've already reached my monthly bandwidth cap in the last ten days.

		Go to the menu, select &quot;Downloads&quot;. Then swipe to the &quot;Completed&quot; tab. The size of the downloaded podcast is shown next to the lower right corner of the podcast icon. Usually this is a plausible value. For example: &quot;21 MB&quot;. Occasionally it displays &quot;0 B&quot;. The download will still play, so this is not a failed download. This happens on AntennaPod 1.3.3.0. It occurs on both phones I use for podcasts: Moto G (XT1031) with Android 4.4.4. Kyocera Hydro Vibe (C6725) with Android 4.4.2 Some podcasts seem more likely to have this problem. But it does not happen consistently. &quot;On The Media&quot;, &quot;This American Life&quot;, and &quot;Planet Money&quot; seem to have it occur most frequently. This is a really minor issue. The strange download size is just a little confusing as it might indicate a problem with the download.

		It seems that adding retrolambda in 3abce4c is breaking my build. Parent commit fd2633e is working fine. when set my HEAD to 3abce4c, and tried to sync gradle in AndroidStudio, I get: Error:Execution failed for task ':core:compileReleaseJavaWithJavac'. When running gradle with java 5, 6 or 7, you must set the path to jdk8, either with property retrolambda.jdk or environment variable JAVA8_HOME What do I need to change in my build environment to get this to work again? Do I need to install the Java8 SDK?

		Hi I can t be sure when this stream crasher is introduced but I am unable to stream with APod anymore. Every attempt to stream from hundreds of subscriptons crashes for no good. I can download them but cant stream them. I was able to stream somewhat steadily in the past but not so easily nowadays. Bear in mind that I have not upgraded my Android since then, so same Android but crashing Apod. This has started showing signs of crashloving in last couple months if I am guessing right.

I have automatic downloads turned off and I can't figure out why it keeps starting up by itself. Is there another setting that I'm missing? Thanks. (Android Kitkat 4.4.2)

		This idea results from reading through the sleep timer improvements implemented with #1072 :-) Those could IMHO be supported by a function to dynamically reduce the playback speed (if Prestissimo is installed) from whatever the user has set to 1.0. It could work by simply distributing the Playback Speeds steps along the Sleep Timer's time axis with the 1st &quot;downstep&quot; happening immediately. Example: Speeds 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 are set upBefore starting the timer, playback is at 1.5x. Setting the sleep timer to 20min, the first 10min play at 1.25 (immediate downstep) and the last 10 at 1.0. If 1.75x was used before and 30min are then timed, 10min each would play at 1.5, 1.25 and 1.0.

		Issue Description I have a 2014 Moto X running official 5.1. I have an issue where if I am listening to an episode, and fast forward it with the slider all the way to the end, it will freeze, and if i get it to move it will give me an error message. Additional Info I listen to episodes at 2x speed and am using the prestissimo library for that. I set the option to auto delete when 100% listened. There is another episode in the queue after the one I am fast forwarding through Thank you very much for all your work.

		Antennapod feature request - &quot;Cog Gears&quot; multiselection for Downloaded Episodes. Hello Antennapodders, Good work and many thanks! Here is a feature request for a workflow: Please enable the enhanced &quot;cog gears and filter&quot; multiselect interface, as it exists for the Podcast Episode listing, for the &quot;Completed Downloads&quot; group. (This button appears in the top row of icons) My particular circumstance (Antennapod 1.3.4.1 dark theme- Samsung S4 mini running AICP custom ROM): I've downloaded LOTS of episedes while I have a good wifi connection. They all enqueue, which is good, but for so many it's hard to sort them properly. So I actually cleared the queue of 145 episodes and now its quite difficult to rebuild it. When I go to the Downloads section via the side bar, I find myself on the blank Running slide-tab. Since any particular user is only actually running the downloads for a short period, it might be better to have &quot;Completed&quot; as the initial display. On the completed slide-tab, I've got the rubbish bin icons on the right to delete individual episodes, but I can't multiselect, filter, group or sort the downloaded episodes. If this Completed Downloads interface had the enhanced filtering and multi-select, we'd be able to 1) rebuild the queue much more efficiently, 2) bulk delete accidentally downloaded, 3) use sort and filter to review the entire collection. This appears to have a similar background to #1209&quot; Add filter and sort options to the &quot;All episodes&quot; view #1209 &quot; Apologies if this has been requested or phrased in a different thread. I just signed onto Github with Antennapod as the catalyst (hooray!)....and while I think I saw something similar in the issues archive, for the life of me I cannot find the thread!

		Last alpha release from yesterday (1.4.0.1) implemented shake to reset (and vibrate) in sleep timer. When shake to reset is not set antennapod dial down sound but do not stop playing. Beside you end up stuck with a low sound level. The only way to get back normal sound level is to set sleep timer with shake to reset and let it stop playing audio.

If you do not install it you can't set play speed option (It asks to download prestissimo) and you can't change speed in player view which do not have speed switch button.

		Antennapod allows for playing of media files via a file manager. The options available during playback are to configure the auto-pause time and to skip the episode. The latter doesn't make sense in this context. It would be better if the option was to delete the file directly. Not only this, but the setting to automatically delete the file once playback completes isn't observed. It would be very useful to add deletion to Antennapod, since otherwise I have to return to the file manager, find the file I was playing etc.

		https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/antennapod/2XSuuRTBUsM: I have set my play list to sort it by (last publishing) date. It would be nice, if the sidebar could be set to sort it by this date, too. Actually it is only sortable by alphabet or by number of episodes. This option would give me the same order in both lists and it would be easier for me to find podcasts that are &quot;dead&quot; and which I could unsubscribe.

		Phone: Motorola Moto X 2011 Android Version: 5.1 Kernel version: 3.4.42-g756aa87 AntennaPod version: 1.3.4.1 I have my phone synced to my car's Bluetooth, and am able to play audio. When I turn off the car, playback pauses, as expected. But when I then hit &quot;play&quot; on the phone, the progress bar does not activate, and the &quot;play&quot; button does not change to &quot;pause&quot;. I need to then open up Android's task manager, kill AntennaPod, then open it again, at which point I see a popup stating that the AntennaPod app had crashed. I click OK, open AntennaPod again, and now playback starts working again. In fact, the same scenario plays out when I go from playing on my phone's speaker, to starting playback over Bluetooth. This bug was first noticed after both upgrading AntennaPod to 1.3.4.1, and upgrading my Android OS from 4.4 to 5.1.

		Hi! We are 3 university students that are doing a course in software engineering and the goal of the course is to take a application like antennapod which we have choosen to do and to investigate it like software architecture design strategies and so on. We also have to investigate different design patterns which has been implemented in this application where we chose Observer Pattern, Singleton and Adaptor. We would like to double check that these patterns are being used in this application!? Another problem, for our next task we need to do a change/feature request, As this is a pretty large application and we are planning to do a bug fix/ change request. A couple of days ago there was a change request about changing the background color for something in the application. We were planning to take that but we can not find it anymore so we figured that someone did it already. Are there any other easy change requests that the community has that we can do for our project? (At the end of the project, we will have to submit a pull request so that we &quot;give back&quot; to the community) Thanks for Helping us out!! Vikhram - Luleå University of Technology

		If an item is playing or in progress (position &gt; 0) then we can't mark it as 'Played' or 'Read'. That's probably wrong since we don't consider an item read until it's actually finished playing.

		I'm sure I have translated a string before with the warning about the necessity of a plugin for variable speed to work. This translation never made it into the app and has now been removed from Transifex as the source string was replaced. The relatively long string changed only a little, however, and I would prefer to update my previous translation rather than thinking of a new one. Would it be possible to recover this string somehow?

		Recently I tried to listen to the System Mastery podcast. The feed's here: http://feeds.feedburner.com/SystemmasteryPodcasts?format=xml It's hosted on Wordpress. The feed loads fine but I get a PROTOCOL_ERROR in AntennaPod. I get the same error in Pocketcasts. The audio files download just fine with desktop clients, curl, etc. The System Mastery folks are at a loss as they didn't change anything, but were getting reports from their users things didn't work properly. I went looking around and found this issue: square/okhttp#1897 so it's possible that there is some change in Android 5.x that in combination with a server change (HTTP 2 support on part of Wordpress?) triggers this problem. I recently learned another podcast, Heavy Cardboard, also hosted on Wordpress, is experiencing very similar issues with Pocket Casts. According to them Pocket Casts is working on a fix but I figured I'd inform you too. http://feeds.feedburner.com/HeavyCardboardPodcast?format=xml

		When resetting the playback position with the context menu in the queue, the info that is shown for that item doesn't get updated immediately. I.e.: AP doesn't replace the 'current play time' and progress bar with the space (MB) that the episodes takes. Info is updated after screen turns off (inactivity), after scrolling the item off-screen or changing screens (go to feed view, for example). Expected behaviour to give immediate feedback that the playback position was reset. AP v. 1.3.4.1 on Android 4.2.2

		I recently flashed my phone to the factory image and now Playback on Antenna Pod is borked. This may be related to issue #1223. Longer podcasts take a few seconds (~2-5 sec) to begin playback, then stop playing after ~3 minutes; if you press play after it stops 3 minutes into playback, it plays again for ~3 minutes -- repeat. Sometimes podcasts will not play at all. this happens especially when I try to play another podcast after pressing play on another one before it has started playing (during that 2-5 second buffer timeframe). Symptoms: Playback only works on occasion. Playback only continues for ~3 to 3:20 minutes. Tested With Episodes Roosterteeth Podcast: 343 Planet Money: 657, 656 Specs: Android 4.4.4 Moto G Generation 1 AntennaPod Version 1.3.1, Commit 2f55256 (From fDroid)

		As @TomHennen suggested in #1152 (comment), I've been working on re-writing the app description. Below is my proposal. If you feel like adapting it, it's easiest to go over to this TitanPad. Please do fill in your GitHub username if you make changes; it makes any discussion easier. Please also provide some explanation if you changed things in the chat facility there. I'll only do a PR to change https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/description/en.txt if some consensus has been reached on the change (hence the TitanPad). Proposed description With AntennaPod you get instant access to millions of free and paid podcasts, from independent podcasters to large publishing houses such as the BBC, NPR and CNN. Add, import and export their feeds hassle-free using the iTunes podcast database, OPML files or simple RSS URLs.

		Phone: Motorola Moto X 2011 Android Version: 5.1 Kernel version: 3.4.42-g756aa87 AntennaPod version: 1.4.0.2 The home screen widget is a 1-high-by-4-wide widget that lists the podcast's title, includes a track progress time indicator in the form of &quot;current hh:mm:ss / total hh:mm:ss&quot; and a play/pause button. I noticed that they current playback time does not update every second, but instead only ever 5 seconds. So if you stare at it while it's playing, instead of seeing 00:02:43... 00:02:44... 00:02.45..., etc, over the course of 20 seconds, you will only see 00:02:43... 00:02:48... 00:02:53... 00:02:58.. 00:03:03. This may be intentional to reduce battery/resource consumption, or may be a limitation of Android's widget refresh rate, but I figured it was worth mentioning.

		Phone: Motorola Moto X 2011 Android Version: 5.1 Kernel version: 3.4.42-g756aa87 AntennaPod version: 1.4.0.2 The home screen widget is a 1-high-by-4-wide widget that lists the podcast's title, includes a track progress time indicator in the form of &quot;current hh:mm:ss / total hh:mm:ss&quot; and a play/pause button. If the AntennaPod app has not recently been opened, is not listed in the recent apps list, or was at some point exited by the Android OS to clear up RAM, the widget does not fully work. In this situation, you see the most recent track's title and the play button, but no progress/total time. Upon hitting the play button, I do see it's on/off-touch actions as the background highlights, but it does not start playing. At this point, I see two options: Option 1: First open the app (using its main icon or clicking elsewhere on widget) and then hit the play button. Now it's registered, and so when you go back to the widget, you now see the current/total time and the widget's play button will function. Option 2: First open the app (using its main icon or clicking elsewhere on widget), but then do not actually hit the play button. Go back to the widget. If you do this, the play button will now function, but the area of the widget which should show the current/total time is still blank. Once this happens, I can't figure out how to get the current/total time to show on the app again. Play/pause it as much as you want, either from the widget or within the app, it looks like the current/total time will not return to the app until the app is cleared from memory (by Android or by you manually) and you execute the steps listed above in Option 1. I know this is really corner case stuff. You have no obligation to address my issues, I'm just happy to provide you information.

		Phone: Motorola Moto X 2011 Android Version: 5.1 Kernel version: 3.4.42-g756aa87 AntennaPod version: 1.4.0.2 I use my phone with two different Bluetooth audio devices. These devices both include one &quot;forward&quot; and one &quot;back&quot; button. In the past, these buttons mapped to the in-track Rewind and Fast Forward functions, which would step back/forward some number of seconds. I liked that. It looks like this functionality changed. It seems now that the &quot;back&quot; hardware button on my Bluetooth devices does nothing within AntennaPod, while the &quot;forward&quot; button now skips to the next podcast file instead of fast forwarding in the current track. Unfortunately, I am unable to say with confidence if this change came about because of a recent update to AntennaPod, or with the recent upgrade my phone experienced from Android KitKat to Lollipop. Please feel free to swat this down if you're confident that no such changes were made on the AntennaPod side, or if this working as intended. Thanks for your consideration.

		AntennaPod currently resumes playing from the position where it was paused, but it would be nice to have an option to rewind a predetermined amount of time when resuming playback. The best solution would be to make the amount of time to rewind a function of the amount of time occurred between pause and resume, up to a certain limit, like 30 seconds or so. For example, it would rewind 10 seconds if we paused for 20 seconds or rewind 20 seconds if we paused for 40. If we paused for a minute or more, it would rewind 30 seconds.

		This is less of a feature request, and more a question of is it currently possible. If I have to uninstall and reinstall Antennapod without a backup, is there a way to let Antennapod know that I have a bunch of episodes already downloaded sitting on my SD card? Or should I just delete all the previously downloaded episodes and redownload them again? Apologies if this is not the right place for these types of questions. I'm new to Github, but this seemed to be the closest place I found that was discussing the software (which is excellent btw)

		Hello everyone, I am using the android application. I have synced with gpodder.net. This is how I made selection in a subsribed channel: I navigate to the podcast I'd like to download, the I tap the download icon. That podcast is now downloading, but the display is scrolled back to the first podcast in the list and I have to scroll to find my last viewed podcast. This happens for the first download after I changed to a new channel. Is it possible to disable that auto refreshment? Thank you!

		I have a S5 mini running KitKat 4.4.2. Setting AntennaPod's download folder to the sd creates empty folders for all of my podcasts. My podcasts continue to be stored on the internal storage. @mfietz and I talked about this in #1207. I assumed from @LoopinFool's comment that #1207 covered KitKat as well... but, I guess I was wrong.

		My device went into a continuous loop of attempting to download a new episode and failing with the message &quot;Insufficient Space&quot;. This also caused the Antennapod download notification to rapidly expand and collapse. I was able to get it to stop by going into the settings and disabling auto-download. Download log screenshot Solid Explorer is displaying memory usage as: Root: 97% (28.8 MB free) Internal Memory: 84% (1.97 GB free) This is on the 2013 Nexus 5. The feed url is: http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/The-Defrag-Show/feed/mp3 I also saved a sample of the feed here: https://gist.github.com/dander/2330a550147b835fbebc The latest episode appears to be ~33 MB, however I think there may be a problem with the feed itself. Even after cleaning up some space, I am unable to download that episode, and the file shows up as 1B in the Queue. However, the download failure loop has stopped.

		hey at first, thanks for your awesome work on this app. i really use it every single day! i listen to a lot of sounds on soundcloud.com, though i thought it'd be cool to handle a soundcloud-stream as kinda podcast-channel and download the tunes to play them offline e.g. when traveling. is that idea possible to implement? best regards

		The best example is when your device is paired with a car stereo. AntennaPod will start playback as soon as the device connects to the car. However, the car stereo may not have the Bluetooth source selected. As a result AntennaPod podcasts will be playing through episodes, but the user will have no idea this is happening. As far as they're concerned they just started their car and are driving somewhere listening to the radio/cd/nothing. One thought for how to resolve this so that it works properly for people with Bluetooth headsets is to have a setting that determines if AntennaPod will start playback on bluetooth reconnect. It has also been suggested that AntennaPod should vibrate some when it starts playback due to a Bluetooth reconnect. This behavior changed in AntennaPod 1.4 alpha, so I think we should try to resolve it before we release 1.4.

		Long ago I was using Prestissimo but there was often an error stopping playback when ending an episode and switching to next in queue. Due to that I stopped using prestissimo. I have been using sonic media player as default since it has been implemented and got no problem with it. I think it would be nice to promote it as default and set it to on with x1 / x1.25 / x1.5 speed. Variable speed is a nice addition and I'm sure a lot of people do not know this feature. (And never go in parameters)

Deleting cache and restarting phone did not help, I had to delete the app data to get the app work again and then reimport all feeds (I luckily had an opml backup from not too long ago).

		Hey, my AntennaPod has a bug with the ordering of the podcasts. Its basically the same problem as described here: #339 I have version 1.3.1 (2f55256) and the issue still exists for me: #339 (comment) Thank you :)

		I've been pregnant with this idea for a while. Recently @keunes reminded me of it: I think it would make a lot of sense to have some kind of knowledge base with tutorials, workarounds (known issues) and other general information. This knowledge base could be started in the wiki. Once we got some information in it, we can integrate it into the app, either at the bottom of the settings (near about) or in the drawer. For the tutorials, we might even have those in the app itself, through something like https://github.com/amlcurran/ShowcaseView (My ideas go from having just screenshots explaining the steps to guiding the user visually through the app)

		It just happened to me that when using the latest AntennaPod version on MM, the lockscreen notifications were repeated under each other again and gain and in the background there also was the lockscreen again and again just like standing between two mirrors. This does not happen all the time and i don't know how i got there. Even the pin entry dialog was doubled.

		I have been a regular subscriber to the &quot;The City Church with Judah Smith&quot;, but lately when I download episodes, the audio run time is 3 or 4 times the actual length of audio for the episode and I am also having playback issues. For example, my wife has an iPhone has downloaded the last two episodes, and here is a comparison of the episode length from iTunes and AntennaPod: Friend of Jesus - Part Three (iTunes Run Time: 45:05, AntennaPod Run Time: 2:06:35) Friend of Jesus - Part Two (iTunes Run Time: 40:17, AntennaPod Run Time: 1:51:03) When I let an episode play uninterrupted, it will play until the exact time listed in iTunes and then it will end and the episode will be removed from the queue even though it has not reached the end of the listed run time. If I pause an episode and then resume play, the audio will not begin from the spot where I paused it and will jump back to near the beginning. It seems as though something is getting corrupted with the run times because the audio quality is fine but I'm not sure why the issues are happening. Here are some further details: My Device: Samsung Galaxy S5, Android Version 5.1.1 Podcast URL: http://thecity.org/feeds/audio Any help would be appreciated.

		Currently, the latest available version of AP on F-Droid is version 1.3.1 while the latest available version on Google Play is 1.3.4 I guess that's not that big of an issue, but it would be great if from 1.4 onwards the two could be in sync again. On the wiki page for AP on F-Droid it says that versions 1.2 and 1.3.4 couldn't be built: We can't build this version: The build for this version was manually disabled. Reason: requires java1.8 Is this something we can resolve? Or would it require action on the side of F-Droid?

		For the Last 2 months or so, most of my podcasts will repeat approx the last 5 mins of the episode. So let's say a podcast is reported by AP to be 40 mins, the podcast might only be 38 mins long but will have the last 2 mins repeated. I suspect this may be related to either pausing or skipping forward in episodes as shorter episodes do not do this. I usually skip adverts, and longer episodes i may not listen to in one go. However, I have also had intermittent problems with skipping lately as well, where skipping forward will sometimes take me back to where I started skipping from (eg I skip at the start of an advert, it tkaes me forward to half way so I skip again and I end up at where I started skipping). My current device is HTC M8 running 5.0.1. I am on the beta program and have the latest version.

		It would be useful to add a skip forward button to the notification tray control. This would make it easier to skip the end of podcasts and/or adverts breaks, rather than having to unlock, open AP, navigate to the player and skip.

		Apart from my name not being in the developers or translators list (I think I am in dev branch), there's a real issue with the 'about' screen. it's nice that the screen now follows the dark theme yet upon every first scrolling after opening there is black flickering overlaying the grey background (once the whole page has been scrolled through, the black flickering stops; after moving away from the screen by opening the contributors list or by going to another app in Android, it flickers again until the first scrollthrough) my Android 'back' button doesn't work (goes to top of/refreshes the page) swiping from left to retrieve the menu doesn't work so now basically I'm stuck in the about screen until closing the app

		The developers have indicated the Google Play crash report contains a lot of valuable information. However, some bugs don't lead to crashes and it may be hard to pinpoint what exactly is going wrong (see e.g. my very vague issue #1264). In those cases, it may be handy to be able to easily copy/send a debug log, as is possible with Open Whisper System's Signal. They've put the option in the settings screen under 'advanced'; in AP the option might fit under the 'Other' section.

But after pressing play in AntennaPod I got audio from both sources: A few seconds from AntennaPod than a few seconds from VLC. After more trying I even got only the last file played from VLC instead of the audio from AntennaPod. My Device: YP-G1 CyanogenMod-Version: 11-201511004-NIGHTLY-ypg1 Android-Version: 4.4.4

		It makes it easier for AP supporters/backers to promote their favourite feature, for developers to check which features are most popular, and for userbase in general to engage with AP. Registration is really simple Maintaining seems doable, meaning there's not much project maintainers need to do except for closing implemented features. Unfortunately, the system doesn't rely on GitHub data and new feature 'requests' created on the platform don't lead to features created on FeatHub, and vice versa. However, the community (including me) can make sure cross-linking happens between feature requests on GitHub and FeatHub. A list of the most-voted features can be embedded in the AP website and/or the project page here on GitHub. (I found this as I was originally searching something to implement this voting-system in an easy way).

		📱 Droid Maxx, Android 4.4.4 This happens when attempting to download episodes of two of my favorite tech podcasts. Podcasts that have this error (both are from DevChat.TV): http://feeds.feedwrench.com/TheFreelancersShow.rss http://feeds.feedwrench.com/JavaScriptJabber.rss I can see the errors in the log section, but I haven't figured out where to find the log file yet. I'm wondering: What might I be able to do to work around this issue? If this is a bug in the podcast feed, what should I tell to the feed owners to fix this? I couldn't figure out whether this is the same issue as #1086. Sorry if it's a duplicate.

		Not sure if this is by design or not. Curiously, it has worked as play for me exactly once. It was at the same time as a different bug with the same headset[1], so I discounted it. 1: That one is on Touchwiz not you. Two devices can connect to the headset at once, and every once in a while Android responds by switching its audio feed to the speaker without changing anything on the UI)

		Version 1.3.4.1 Commit: a083a0c I am having an issue where playing (and seeking through) several episodes of the Monstercat podcast does not work. I think it may have something to do with the media files, since MX Player also crashes, but Google Music does not, and it also works perfectly on the iPhone podcast app. Particularly episode 81 causes crashes. I have redownloaded the media files, but the problem persists. There is no problem playing any other podcast on my device. I am wondering if anyone else sees this same problem. If I can turn on error reporting somehow, I would post a log.

		Comparing the list of languages translated to this Transifex import list (if that indeed is what it is), it seems that Norwegian Bokmål (Norway) // 99% // Nov 01, 04:03p.m. // [nb_NO] is fully translated but not imported from Transifex. Bokmål ([ˈbuːkmɔːl], literally &quot;book tongue&quot;) is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90%[2] of the population in Norway. (Wikipedia) Given the above, I assume [nb_NO] strings could also be used to cover [no].

		Following the discussion in #1369 and earlier thoughts, I would like to propose a translation threshold for including languages in the app. If a language has less than that threshold translated (the 'English' resource, not considering the description or changelog), then we shouldn't provide it in the app. This would create a cleaner interface in the app itself. But it also relates to the question of claiming which languages you support in Google play, maybe later on the website as well: if you have just 50% translated, than it wouldn't be fair to claim that language is supported. Though a bit arbitrarily, I would suggest a threshold of 75%. This would cut off the following languages: Hebrew (Israel) 74% [he_IL] Russian (Russia) 74% [ru_RU] Polish (Poland) 68% [pl_PL] Danish 68% [da] Portuguese (Brazil) 62% [pt_BR] Greek 59% [el] NOTE: Greek is currently not imported from Transifex either Hindi (India) 52% [hi_IN] Italian 49% [it] NOTE: Italian (Italy) // 85% // Nov 01, 04:03p.m. // [it_IT] is available, so it_IT can be used for it Romanian (Romania) 44% [ro_RO] Azerbaijani 38% [az] Spanish (Spain) 35% [es_ES] NOTE: Spanish // 100% // Nov 03, 05:03p.m. // [es] is available, so escan be used for es_ES and other languages with less than 35% of the strings translated I put the languages that will be available on the wiki: Supported languages I would be willing to spend some time activating people to update the languages that are just below the threshold.

		Hello! I had to reset my factory smartphone and am now struggling to get AntennaPod back to the previous status, which I had saved by syncing the /data/de.danieloeh.antennapod/files/folder. I synced it back, but neither AntennaPod 1.3.4.1, nor 1.4.0_rc10 and 11 recognise the files that are already present in its new data folder. Adding new subscriptions works fine, but what can I do to get the old subscriptions, downloads and playback status back? Thanks for any advice! PS: And in order to prevent the same problem in the future: Is the cache folder required in the backup, or other locations as well? Can the playback queue be backed-up?

		Since the 1.4.0.12 update, reordering episodes in my queue exhibits strange behavior. Suppose I have 5 episodes in order: A B C D E and I want to move 'A' to the end of the queue. I tap the squares on the left, and drag it down. The episodes wiggle back and forth and maybe half the time A ends up at the end. Sometimes it ends up in the middle, sometimes it moved down one spot. Sometimes I get a queue like this: B E A C D That's the actual order I ended up with just now on my phone, trying to drag A to the end. Also, this may be unrelated, but if I turn off the display, sometimes the queue is scrolled back to the top when I turn the screen back on. I'm not sure yet exactly what triggers it, but it'd be nice if it stayed where I was previously. Just now, I tried it 10 times, got bumped back to the top of the queue 7 out of the 10. I love the product, but this feels less polished than the previous release. If any other information would help diagnose the issue, I'm happy to help. I am on a Nexus 4 with android 5.1.1.

		Hi there Since the last update (1.4.0.12) I'm experiencing big performance problems. The UI is much slower now. The biggest problem is the feed update. Instead of 1-3 seconds, it now takes about 30 seconds (6 parallel downloads, 26 podcast-feeds). In this time the app is not usable. (freezing, slow) Is there anyone else with the same problem? Is there a fix? I'm using a Moto G LTE with Android 4.4.4 best regards Jürgen

		Hi, I would like to get rid of episodes I either have listened or marked as played. When I mark an episode as played is that considered to be played so that Auto Delete kicks in and deletes them? That's the way I would like for it to work. If they are not deleted, what happens to episodes that are marked as played? Does it make any difference when it comes to deleted if they also are removed from the queue?

		The latest version from F-Droid, 1.4.0.12 fails to load RSS feeds from KPFA such as: https://kpfa.org/program/flashpoints/feed/ The TLS config looks good: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=kpfa.org The XML is valid but there are some feed validity issues: https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkpfa.org%2Fprogram%2Fflashpoints%2Ffeed%2F This is a screenshot of the error message: https://docs.webarch.net/w/images/Screenshot_2015-11-25-16-50-29.png I note that the MP3 URLs use HTTP and not HTTPS which is a shame, but the KPFA RSS feeds were working with previous versions.

		I ran into some problems when trying to replay an episode that I just finished playing. As soon as the episode finishes playing, its entry in the episode list becomes &quot;grayed out&quot;, and there's no way to play it again: the &quot;play&quot; icon is actually stuck in the &quot;pause&quot; state, and the time navigation bar is unresponsive. Please note that the &quot;Auto delete&quot; setting is off (and I can see the downloaded file is still in the media folder). If I close antennapod, open it again and try to play the episode (which is still grayed out): sometimes the app still behaves as described above sometimes the app crashes when I click on the episode (&quot;Unfortunately antennapod has stopped&quot;). sometimes I can replay the episode by long pressing on it and selecting &quot;Reset playback position&quot;, but then there is no way to control playback (pause, seek, stop), and playback goes on even if I close or kill the application! I'm using version 1.4.0.12 from the f-droid repository, on android 4.2.2

			<description>
		Usually podcasts last way longer than songs, 60 and 90 minutes are quite common. And many of them have 'garbage' (ads, uncut overlapping times from other contiguous chapters or programs), that you would like to skip especially at the end of the episode, all while considering current episode as fully played. I guess that this is why a 'smart mark as played' optional time is offered; you can currently choose between No and 15/30/45/60 seconds. I would like to request to expand this to allow to select for several minutes. For example, my typical podcast has usually around 5 minutes of overlapping content at the end I have to skip to go to next episode. I would bet that 5 minutes for something 60/90/120 minutes long is way more frequent than 60 seconds, the longest I can choose. Adding 5 and 10 minutes to the current available options would more or less make it for many people with minimal developer effort. Alternatively, I would rather prefer to let me choose the amount in seconds I want, instead of being only offered a closed set of predefined values. This way developers would not need to guess which options to offer, simply let the user enter what they feel it fits him. That would be slightly more complicated to code, but not much; perhaps only some code to prevent absurdly high or negative values to be accepted would be in order for safety.

		Hi, I am getting a lot of these in my download log: 'Parser exception at line x,column y: not well formed (invalid token)' It happens to random subscribed podcasts it seems. But it looks like most of the episodes with this error eventually get downloaded. I wonder what this error means and if there's anything I can do about it? I'm running AntennaPod on an Oppo Find 7 with Oppo Android 5.1 AOSP.

		I love the app and this is an exceedingly minor gripe, but I imagine it is likely pretty easy to achieve as well. Since 1.4 the podcast art now displays as the background of the lockscreen. I don't really like this. Artwork like this, pretty much by definition doesn't fit a 9:16 ratio screen. I don't want it to be stretched, tiled, centered, letter-boxed, etc. I'd much rather just see my regular background than have artwork that changes every 20-90 minutes anyways. It's not like I don't know what I'm listening to anyways and the notification is already there if I don't. Just hoping that this can be made optional in the settings, even if ON is the default. Thanks.

		Android version: 4.4.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo Expected behaviour: The scrolling position in queue view should persist. Current behaviour: Running version 1.4.0.12, the scrolling position in queue view is not properly persisted. After the device comes back from lock screen, the top item of queue is shown. Usually I want to select a recent Podcast from the bottom of the queue and, thus, I have to scroll down again and again which is annoying. First occured: After update from 1.3.x (or 1.2.x?) to 1.4.0.12 Steps to reproduce: In a queue with many items scroll all the way down. Lock the screen. Unlock the screen. The queue view appears scrolled all the way up.

		When one of the downloaded podcasts is corrupted (e.g. I can see the file size is just 3.95kB), I am no longer able to play any of the already downloaded podcasts. When I click the play button, the episode appears at the bottom edge of the screen, but it does not play. I am able to fix this by deleting all such episodes See attached log. It may be related to issue 1080. This is on Android 4.0.4, antennapod 1.4.0.12 from F-Droid logcat.txt

		Is it possible to move data to the SD card by creating a folder there, move the data from ~/.Android to the new directory and then point to it from Settings? Actually, instead of having a way to set the data directory a move option would be better since it could be used also after the app has been in use and have data gathered.

		Android version: 5.1.1 Device model: Nexus 4 (LG) App version: 1.4.1.4 After upgrading the app to version 1.4.1.4, the filter option in the podcast view stopped working. It still shows &quot;Filtered&quot; under the header, but no filtering is applied. When I click the filter button, not option is selected despite my previous setting. When I select any option, nothing happens. When I return to the filter menu, the previously selected option is deselected once again in most cases (though sometimes a selection sticks, though it is still not applied).

		I am running AntennaPod on my Galaxy S2 with CM 12.1. When I open the side menu and press the physical back button on the phone, the app closes. In other apps like the email app or the play store, the physical back button closes the side menu, when it is open (, when pressed again with the side menu closed it closes the app). It's not a big issue, but it interferes with my muscle memory, since all other apps react as described.

		The last AntennaPod update (1.4.1.4) seems to have affected the refresh process on my phone (HTC one M8, KitKat v.4.4.4). When I press the refresh arrow, the arrow icon continues to &quot;circle&quot; and only stops when the phone goes into sleep mode (after which the new episodes are loaded). It used to be a fast process and I never had any problems before this update. I love this app - any help resolving this issue would be much appreciated.

		Galaxy tab 3 8 android 4.4.2 antennapod 1.4.1.4 with french locale from Fdroid With the last update &quot;Number of new and unplayed episodes&quot; and &quot;Number of new episodes&quot; seem to have been inverted. I need to select &quot;new and unplayed episodes&quot; so it can display the numbers of new episodes. Don't know if its a inversion at the translation level or code level. Had to check trough Transiflex to get english text.

		I just upgraded from 1.4.0.12 to 1.4.1.4 (f-droid repository) and antennapod now seems to take a very long time when refreshing feeds: instead of 5-6 seconds per feed, often almost 20-30 seconds: indeed often my screen goes off for power saving (30 seconds) and the refresh icon is still running in circles. Anyway, as soon as I turn on the screen, the feed is always updated. So I tried this: press &quot;update feed&quot; wait 5-6 seconds (the average time it usually took for refresh in previous versions) and turn off the screen (press power button) wait 1 second and turn on the screen And the feed is almost always refreshed! So it seems the refresh process is running at the usual speed, but it's not properly displayed on the screen, it takes some triggering event (screen power off-on) to have the display status updated. I also tried deleting and re-adding feeds, but this doesn't affect the problem.

		Sometimes loading the completed downloads screen takes unreasonably long (over 1 minute). Other screens such as the page for a podcast also sometimes takes very long, but this might be due to loading content from the internet. The completed downloads screen on the other hand should only need local data and should take at most 1 second to load.

		Current situation: update interval isn't set (ie every feed needs manual updating) Proposal: update interval is set to 24 hours Novice users aren't necessarily going through all settings. Personally I did expect auto-update to be on by default. Other news-ish apps (like email, of our public broadcaster) also do auto-update, at least on opening the app, so I'd say it's not that strange of behaviour (in today's fast-moving world). Considering 'mobile updates' are disabled by default, there is no negative consequences for the user in terms of costs or data usage (we can assume in virtually all cases wifi is means absence of negative outcomes for users such as unexpected costs/speed deprivation).

		There currently is no way to find out current interval/time settings. If I set an interval value for updating before, I would expect that specific radio button to be on. (i.e. I set the interval to 12 hours, go again through interval/time introduction and re-open interval setting screen, i expect that one to be 'on') Also, the interval setting screen closes almost immediately after selecting an interval. The only feedback to the user is the highlighted button, but that's probably (at least in my case) below the user's finger and invisible. Maybe the whole row should be highlighted, or the window should close with a bit of a delay.

		Actually I had started to write the following: I checked in transifex if it wasnt some translation mistake, but it seems it's not. In 1.4.2.0 it seems filtering of 'downloaded' and 'not downloaded' episodes are reversed. I.e.: when filtering for downloaded episodes Until I realised that actually it does work as expected, technically at least. From a user perspective, filtering is a bit counter-intuitive (to me, and). Rather than 'Hide episodes [that fulfill selected criteria]' I expect(ed) 'Only show [episodes that fulfil selected criteria]. I know I'm stupid not to read the dialog title, but I think it does show current practice may not be so intuitive. Looking at other apps I have installed, positive filtering does seem standard practice. Now, I understand this is yet another issue where 'users may get confused if we change things', but I wanted to share this 'insight' and I'm curious to what the developers think of positive filtering in this case (especially in the imaginary circumstances the filtering was new and unknown yet to users).

		I re-installed antennapod and tried to import some feeds from a local OPML file but it didn't work. In the &quot;OPML import&quot; screen, I click on &quot;From local filesystem&quot;, I get the &quot;Complete action using...&quot; popup dialog, I choose my usual file manager (Ghost Commander), navigate to the file, click on the file and nothing happens, I'm back in the &quot;OPML import&quot; screen again. I'm sure the OPML file is OK, importing podcasts from the very same file used to work in previous versions of antennapod (unfortunately I can't recall the exact version when it worked). Another small bug: if I repeat the import process, I always have to choose the external filemanager, even if I select &quot;Always&quot; in the &quot;Complete action using...&quot; popup dialog; so it seems antennapod is not keeping track of the choice. (BTW Importing from gpodder.net works)

		Antennapod should verify that the data downloaded is the media data. If connected to a hotel or airport Wifi that require further login, the downloaded file is small, around 1-20 kb. It is probably the network login screen, but antennapod assumes that it media file and trys to play it. Which generally hangs the program and it is killed. A connection with blocking, may also have similar problems, where the blocking message is received instead of the media data. I suggest two corrective actions: Verify that the internet connection is available, before attempting to download the episode. Check that the received data is actually a valid media file after it is received. If not, don't let it be played. Workaround: Look for media files that are too small and delete them from the cache manually. I also have problems where antennapod hangs when an audio podcast ends, followed by a video. Again, checking the data, before attempting to play it should allow using the correct codec. The check should be done on the next podcast in background while playing the first podcast or when it approaches the end.

		Using AntennaPod in Dutch, some of the tab/button labels are cut off (for buttons) or characters are put on a next line (for tabs) because the strings are too long (due to the way our language works). Would it be possible to build in some mechanism for automatic line ending (for labels)? Shouldn't tab sizes (width) auto-adept to label length?

		Here's a frequent offender: http://www.kqed.org/.pod/forum They add new entries without media content, then add the content to the entry several hours (days?) later. In AP, these new &quot;episodes&quot; show up with a &quot;mark as played&quot; check mark instead of download icon. There seems to be no way of adding these episodes to the queue (so I can remember to download them later, when they become available) If marked as read/played, these don't reappear as new when actual content is added later (even if the updated feed now includes content) A similar (but slightly different) offender: http://www.sciencefriday.com/feed/podcast/podcast-video/ Adds links to the media file, but the media file is not available (HTTP/404) for some days. Possible solutions: implement a &quot;download queue&quot; -- use standard download rules, but don't start the download until the media file is available. If media file unavailable, don't remove from download queue. This is probably the best solution, though most effort to implement... allow adding episodes without media to the queue -- let user download manually later when media file becomes available, episode should be re-added to the &quot;New&quot; episode list

		App version: 1.4.2.2 Android version: 4.4.4 Device model: HTC one M8 Expected behaviour: When opening a podcast feed (the list of total available episodes for an individual podcast) and manually refreshing via the refresh icon, the new episode should show up in this list after the refresh process has finished. Current behaviour: When opening a podcast feed (the list of total available episodes for an individual podcast) and manually refreshing via the refresh icon, the new episode does not show up in this list, initially. Only after some triggering event (such as selecting another podcast, selecting an individual podcast episode, selecting the Queue) and then returning to the podcast feed, does the new episode display in the podcast feed. Note: This issue is just for the podcast feeds. The new episodes in the Episodes list display right away after manually refreshing (they do not need some triggering event to display). First occurred: After the update to Version 1.4.2.2 (I believe this issue was described by Virhub in the closed thread #1483 after the update to 1.4.2.2)

		In 1.5.0rc0 , on the queue activity, there is much more space between the episode title and the play/download buttons. This would be great but I now have no way of viewing the show notes in landscape mode, since they only have about 4px of the screen, if the player is also visible at the bottom of the screen. App version: 1.5.0rc0 dropbbox Android version: CM11 Device model: Nexus S resolution 800x480 Expected behaviour: Plenty of pixels for show notes like in 1.4.x Current behaviour: Hard to read show notes First occured: 8 days ago

		Currently, almost half (95 of the 201) issues don't have labels. Also, sometimes labels aren't updated according to new comments from the OP. Lastly, I think we need a new label called 'Under discussion' (for larger issues like updated logo, auto download oldest episode first, etc). I don't want to pretend to know what's good/useful for the developers, but I can imagine the project would benefit of more (consequent) use of issue labels. Especially after @mfietz' great work on the 'early spring clean-up' :) I'd like to volunteer to take on the job of applying issue labels. I know that'd (unfortunately) mean I'd also be able to merge PR's and do other technical stuff, but wouldn't wan to and you'd have to trust me not to do so.

		Playback stops and AntennaPod notification vanishes. Backward skip works fine. Soft buttons (ie. fast forward while screen on) work fine. Same result with buttons on bluetooth headphones, even with screen on. Same result if episode skip or fast forward is checked. Deinstalled Prestissimo, same result. I don't know if this is related to the other hardware button issues.

		Hi, I'm using AntennaPod 1.4.2.2 on CyanogenMod 13 (Android 6). Since I upgraded to Android 6 (with factory reset) I cannot seek a time position in the audio anymore. This also means I cannot pause the playback because the title will start from the beginning, again. A short pause leaving the app active will work, though. I tried the Sonic Media Player, Prestissimo and the vanilla after reinstalling the App.

		I'm sure if this is a problem in the settings or wanted behavior, but AntennaPod doesn't pause for an incoming call if the phone is on vibration and i can't find the place where I can set the behavior to pause every time, when a call comes in. Thank you for all your work!

		Since yesterday both manual and automatic feed refreshes are failing. I get a while host of errors under the Episodes menu at the different times when I attempted to refresh including - unknown error, IO error: open failed: eaccess etc. The only change I made was to install CM Security and AVAST Antivirus but after the error I uninstalled both. Then after restarting I was able to refresh all feeds successfully one time. Next I installed CM Security again as I need an antivirus and wanted to isolate which one of the 2 I installed previously might have something to do with the AP error. The feeds failed again this morning. I installed CM and restarted the phone. However this time without any antivirus on the phone AP is still unable to refresh the feeds giving an &quot;unknown error&quot;.

		The title says it already. I have a podcast episode, which has a size of 109444697 bytes. This is 109 MB or 104 MiB in the IEC standard (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte). In the list overview of episodes, AntennaPod displays 104 MB, but it should rather be 104 MiB or 109 MB.

		Android version: 5.0.2 Device model: MEDION X5004 Expected behaviour: Seeking in any podcast episode should just work. Current behaviour: With one particular podcast, I have this problem that seeking beyond a certain position does not work correctly. The Podcast is Linux Voice, Season 3 Episode 22. When the podcast starts, I seek to a position beyond 35 minutes (e.g. 00:36:54). Then one of the following two things happen: Either the podcast stops as if it was hitting the end of the mp3-file. The next episode starts playing automatically. Or, and this is quite strange, the (visual) seeking succeeds, the new display time is 00:36:54 and continues to increase in every second (00:36:55, 00:36:56, ...), but the audio track is wrong. The audio that is played is from the start of the podcast episode (00:00:01, 00:00:02, ...). First occured: Version 1.4.2.2 / occurred sometime around 2015-12-23 Steps to reproduce: Subscribe to Linux Voice Podcast via iTunes. Download Season 3 Episode 22 Start playing the episode. Seek to position 00:35:00 or beyond. Repeat step 4 several times, until you see the above behavior. Environment (Settings you have changed, e.g. Auto Download. &quot;Unusual&quot; devices you use, e.g. Bluetooth headphones. Do you still use Prestissimo?): I have changed some setting, but can't remember what. I do not use any headphones or other devices with the phone. I do not have Prestissimo or any other related app (to my knowledge) installed.

		In 1.5.0.2 alpha we got a nice audio player redesign but I feel there is a problem with play controls. In #1561 screenshot it looks like play control bar is still the same size as previous design but it's not actually true : Play controls are too close to time bar making it more difficult not clicking by error on time bar. Besides if you compare with screenshots in #1561 you can also notice there is more space above podcast name and below episode name. (Maybe it's normal since podcast image is smaller in my screenshot)

			<description>
		When in the playback view, changing the playback speed unpauses playback. Reproduction steps: Staat playback Pause it in playback view Tap playback speed, a few times -&gt; playback unpauses, play button doesn't change There are a few other oddities I noticed related to this. By my knowledge I only had 1x playback selected before the last few updates. After, I could change between 0.5 up to 2.0. I went into the menu, afterwards only between 1.0 and 2.0. Curious, I went to look at the specific setting and found a range of 1.1 to 2.0 enabled, all these ranges in steps of 0.1. Going back to the playback view it no longer went to 1.0, keeping to the range in the setting. I suppose something in the update did something strange, or that one time when I enabled sonic for a second. It's so strange a collection of bugs I doubt it'll be easily reproduceable.

		I don't use different playback speeds so I have all but 1.00x disabled in the settings. Despite that, it still appears in the lower left corner, which isn't too bad but unnecessary. It however also still appears as a slider in the audio controls, where i can set it to anything still, though it gets ignored upon exit. I understand where this all comes from, but I feel like between the settings and the UI controls there is some excess of options. I can't think of a perfect solution, so I hope you will.

		When you do an OPML export, it gets saved in the antennapod folder, which gets deleted if you uninstall it. This is rather unfortunate, as keeping the data even though you're uninstalling the app is rather the point of the OPML export. Could this be changed so it either saves it in someplace which doesn't get deleted, or doesn't delete that specific file when uninstalling? As a secondary concern, doing two exports results in only one file. Does it get overwritten? I suggest saving it with timestamps in the name or just numbering them. Thirdly, maybe you should by default leave some settings and subscription data behind when uninstalling? You make it far too easy to lose all settings and subscriptions. Sincerely, A quite grumpy settingless and subscriptionless user Nexus 5 | AP v.1.5.0.2 | Android 6.0.1

		I would love to be able to make multiple playlists. For example one for news and another one for documentaries. An example of usage would be the history podcasts by Dan Carlin. They're long and should be heard in the correct order. I would make a playlist of one period of history (as Dan does in his naming structure of podcasts). Then I could listen to topical podcasts of news and current affairs for a while, and when I have more time I can listen to another one is a series of history podcasts. Maybe a solution could be an ability to add tags to podcasts, manually and automatically, and then create, sort and play queues based on tags? Related topic: sorting the order of podcasts is not very 'discoverable'...

		I have searched on iTunes for the podcast &quot;Blue Ocean World&quot;. I subscribed to it (and I don't need to emphasize, right?, that I am very grateful that AntennaPod allows me to search subscriptions on iTunes). When downloading the subscription correctly propagated to my gpodder.net account as well, and it has correct name and issues in the AntennaPod. However, when I look on the subscription on gpodder.net, I see it named as &quot;Unnamed Podcast&quot;. That is not good. It's true RSS stream turns out to be http://www.hellohoratio.com/podcast.xml (and if subscribe to it on gpodder.net via this URL then it gets name, issues, correctly). Is there something wrong with propagating metadata obtained from iTunes?

			<description>
		Sometimes when downloading a file the download cannot complete for one reason or another. When the download is re-attempted / resumed, it eventually can succeed. The interesting bit is that when the file is finally played, it sometimes has a section of audio repeated around where the download failed and was restarted. That is, the audio plays, then at some point the last few seconds repeat. However, the issue is not the playback, as once the file is downloaded the repeating bit can always be reproduced. It is also possible that when the download is continued from being interrupted the resulting audio file may contain a section which is invalid and sounds like static when played for a brief moment around the section where the re-download occurred. This can be observed on AntennaPod 1.4.2.2 from F-Droid.

I then tried to download a podcast episode, but the message &quot;Failed to access external storage&quot; pops up. Also, if the path stated above is selected, OPML Import doesn't work, either. Internal storage must be selected for it to import subscriptions successfully.

		This has happened to me recently when upgrading my galaxy s4 (i9505) from stock 4.3 to cyangen 12, then more recently to cyangen 13. Basically after the update antennapod loads and says 'external storage not mounted' I can't do anything in antennapod. I managed to fix it both times by flushing the app data, which meant I had to manually subscribe again to every pod cast and download them all again. From what I've seen online it seems to be where the previous path to the data (which I keep on an external sd card so my internal card doesn't get bloated) is invalid. Would it be possible to add an option when the expected storage path isn't found to redefine it?

			<description>
		Currently, when importing an OPML file, 'deselect all' is hidden behind a menu button, and both 'select all' and 'deselect all' are still visible when it makes no sense to apply them. Proposal: when none or a few (up to all but one) are selected) display 'select all', otherwise (in case everything is selected) display 'deselect all'. This unclutters the UI, and (at least to me when migrating to a new phone) the only most logical thing to do is to select a few feeds manually, or everything via the button. The rare case when 'deselect all' is wanted, is (I guess) when a person changes their mind: A) first thought 'I want all' then thought 'I want just a few', or B) first thinking 'I want feeds A-G' then thinking 'I want feeds Q-Z' (e.g. in case selecting many feeds manually and wanting to switch to another set. In these cases users will likely figure out to press 'select all' and then 'deselect all'.

		Hi! I do not have apps from the play store set to automatically update, so when I switched to a new phone Antennapod was an older version (1.3.4.1). On the new phone the newest version of Antennapod was installed (1.4.2.2). I backup the application data for Antennapod using Helium then restored it on the new phone. When I tried to fetch the feeds they all produced an Unknown Error. I then tried upgrading the old phone to the newest version (1.4.2.2) of Antennapod and started Antennapod fresh and fetched feeds. This worked. I then backup Antennapod on the old phone and restored on the new phone. I started Antennapod fresh and tried to fetch feeds. I got an Unknown Error for each feed it tried to fetch. I then tried uninstalling Antennapod on the new phone. Then reinstalling Antennapod and restoring the data with Helium. I got an Unknown Error for each feed it tried to fetch. I am not sure how to proceed other than I would need to start fresh and export then import via OPML or via gpodder.net. This means I will lose all my downloaded episodes and their status. Correct? Any other ideas on moving Antennapod to a new phone? Thanks again for all your hard work on Antennapod! Frederick App version: (from Google Play) 1st time 1.3.4.1 ==&gt; 1.4.2.2 2nd and 3rd time 1.4.2.2 ==&gt; 1.4.2.2 Android version: 4.1.2 ==&gt; 4.4.2 Device model: Samsung S3 mini ==&gt; Samsung S5 mini Expected behaviour: Moving the data should allow feeds to be fetched Current behaviour: Fetching feeds on the new device produces and Unknown Error for all feeds it attempts to fetch First occured: Version 1.4.2.2 / yesterday Steps to reproduce: Move Antennapod data from one Android phone to another using Helium.

		I suggest a change to the on-screen video controls. It would be nice if the controls do not disappear while using them. Currently, if I am playing a video podcast and hit the 30sec FF button (on the screen) several times, the controls will eventually disappear, no matter how frequently I am hitting the FF button. I can be rapidly hitting that button, and all of a sudden they on-screen controls disappear. Obviously they come right back after touching the screen again, but it may be nice to prevent them from going away. It is good to have the on-screen controls disappear eventually, however, I suggest to keep the controls on-screen for a minimum number of seconds after touching a playback control button. Maybe 5 seconds. Then the controls should disappear after that. Hopefully I am clear in my description.

		When setting my development environment following the wiki instructions I noticed that the link to flattr4j which points to http://www.shredzone.org/attachments/download/250/flattr4j-core-2.7.jar is now broken, as you get redirected to https://shredzone.org/index.html There doesn't seem to be a place where to download the &quot;compiled&quot; jar file. Also, the following is mentioned on the Github page of the project at https://github.com/shred/flattr4j : Important Note Flattr is currently changing its API. Because of that, some of the flattr4j calls are failing or not delivering the expected results. It is unclear to me what a future API may look like, and to what extend flattr4j is going to support it. For the time being, I recommend not to use flattr4j in new projects. So to create PR #1722 I didn't include this jarfile. The app runs fine, but as I have not been using Flattr since ~2013, I can't test the Flattr-specific bits. Question: Is the Flattr integration from AntennaPod still working, or is it affected by the API changes mentioned above? In any case, the wiki should probably be changed. The reason I didn't do it myself directly, is that I don't know what it should be changed to: either, if the code is broken, remove this .jar dependency (and thus also probably remove all Flattr code from the app?) or, if the code is still working, try to find another place where the jarfile can be downloaded from. (I suppose we don't want to ask new contributors to compile that jarfile, I for one have no clue what needs to be done for that, and am not interested in a git clone of that project's source code.

		App version: 1.5.0.9 from F-Droid Android version: 4.4.4 Current behaviour: Play/pause button can stop working after the screen has turned off (after the screen is turned back on of course). First occured: Version 1.5 (worked on 1.4) Steps to reproduce: With the current episode in focus: Play something Turn off the screen Turn on the screen Pause (this works) Play/resume doesn't work AND Stop/pause playback Turn off the screen Turn on the screen Press play (this works) Pause doesn't work As a workaround, if you press back you get the currently playing episode at the bottom and the play/pause button there works. If you focus a different app before turning the screen off, turn the screen on and then focus AntennaPod again it works fine. So the problem occurs only when the app has focus (on the current episode). Environment: Do you still use Prestissimo? No, and I have tried Sonic on and off.

		App version: 1.5.0.9 (commit a97788a - from Google Play) Issue: Usually in the New Episodes or All Episodes list, the podcast an episode belongs to is identified by the thumbnail. If the episode has an episode specific thumbnail though, its difficult to tell which podcast its from. Currently I copy the URL and paste it in another app, rather than go through the episodes list and find the match. Requested change: In the episode view, display the podcast name in a smaller text size below or above the episode title. I think the size and style of the date and length would work well.

		I'm running AntennaPod 1.5.0.9 on Android 6.01. Since the latest update I keep getting download report notifications that are stuck. The only way to get rid of them is to kill the app. I was expecting to be able to swipe them away. The notification in the screenshot was stuck for hours.

		When dragging episodes up or down in the queue, I often get crashes. If there is no crash, the queue frequently ends up out of order. Sometimes merely dragging an episode up or down one slot causes a crash. I have found at least one reproduction case. Suppose you start with episodes A, B, C, and D in order: -A -B -C -D Tap on A and start to drag down, so you should end up with B A C D When A's row gets to where you would expect it to swap with B, the app does one of two things: crashes immediately (I haven't figured out why this happens yet), or the remaining episodes all slide down another row (D pushing into a previously nonexistent row): -A -B -C -D If you continue to hold and drag A down, when it gets to B's new row, the app crashes. This reproduces for me 100%. I also am experiencing some bugginess moving an episode up, but haven't found a watertight repro case yet. Usually it manifests itself by moving the episode an extra space or two. Sometimes the app crashes. I noticed this in the last few days. I don't remember the exact first time, but I would guess no earlier than a week ago. AntennaPod version: I signed up for the beta some time ago, but am not sure if I'm actually getting beta builds. My App info says I have version 1.5.1.3 Android 5.1.1, Nexus 4

		Hi! When trying to play episodes from the NSFW podcast, Antennapod crashes. I did not have that problem in the past, I think since version 1.5.x. The crash does only appear with sonic mediaplayer checked. Without sonic mediaplayer, the episode plays as it should. The device runs with CM12.1 nightly. Here is the link to the podcast: http://not-safe-for-work.de/feed/m4a and here the crashlog: [ Environment ] Android version: 5.1.1 OS version: 3.4.0-cm-g28a6663 AntennaPod version: 1.5.0.9 Model: Xperia Z1 Device: honami Product: C6903 [ StackTrace ] java.lang.IllegalStateException: play() called on uninitialized AudioTrack. at android.media.AudioTrack.play(AudioTrack.java:1141) at org.antennapod.audio.SonicAudioPlayer$2.run(SonicAudioPlayer.java:733) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:818)

		While I am listening to a podcast, I unlock my phone to pause it. I cannot play the podcast again since the button becomes unresponsive. Details below. App version: 1.5.0.9 from Google Play Store Android version: 6.0.1 Devide model: Nexus 5 Expected behaviour: Press play button. Podcast plays. Play button icon changes to pause button icon. Current behaviour: Press play button. Button is unresponsive. The podcast doesn't play. Play button icon remains. First occured: about a week ago Steps to reproduce: Open a podcast and be on the main podcast screen with the audio controls and podcast picture/description. Make sure the podcast is playing. Press power button to lock phone. Unlock phone. You should be back on the main podcast screen. Press pause button. The podcast will pause. Press play button. The button will be unresponsive. This can also be recreated with the podcast not initially playing, in which case the pause button will be unresponsive. If you press the back button and then click on the bottom tab to get back to the main podcast screen, the play/pause button will once again be responsive.

		When playing Opus files in AntennaPod there is a loud noise (similar to random noise). The actual audio can faintly be heard, which means there might be not that much going wrong. Tested files: some episodes in http://feeds.metaebene.me/newz/opus https://people.xiph.org/~giles/2012/opus/ehren-paper_lights-96.opus The files play back fine on the same device both in Firefox and in VLC with full hardware acceleration enabled. Other formats play just fine. App version: 1.5.1.4 (Google Play, commit f197f0e) Android version: 5.1.1 (Cyanogenmod 12.1-20151213-NIGHTLY-e975) Devide model: LG Optimus G (LG-E975) Expected behaviour: Proper audio output. Current behaviour: The actual audio content is played, but overlaid with loud noise. Environment: Sonic mediaplayer is enabled and Prestissimo not installed. Would be marvelous if that was fixed as I'm currently working on a proxy which recodes podcasts to bandwidth saving opus.

		App version: 1.5.0.8 and later (now 1.5.1.0), F-Droid build Android version: 5.1 - Using CyanogenMod 12.1 Device model: Samsung S4 Mini Expected behaviour: Works as expected without crashes Current behaviour: Crashes either on open, or sometimes after reinstall works for a short while. After initial crash however it never works again (unless reinstalled). First occurred: 2- 3 weeks ago. In a bit to save some RAM, I force closed services for a number of apps, stupidly ignoring the warnings Cyanogen gave me that this might cause apps to fail. Following this Antennapod crashed every time I tried to open it. Steps to reproduce: Go into android task manager and force stop the Antennapod service (in Cyanogen this means going to running apps, clicking into antennapod, forcing stop service, ignoring the warning). Try to open Antennapod. App fails ('the app has stopped' or similar message). Sometimes after reinstalling Antennapod it works again for a short while but afterwards fails to start. - Hi, I've posted about this in the Cyanogen forums as well and it seems like the only fix might be factory reset. I don't really understand why this is happening even when I use various forms of uninstall, reboot, reinstall, clear data for the app, but none of this seems to fix the problem I have caused! I'm not at all sure this is a problem with AntennaPod, but I'm including this bug report here for your information. Thanks, Nick

Current behavior: in Queue, slide episode to right to mark as played the little message at bottom correctly says the episode has been marked as played, and there is an undo button but the episode gets back in the list to really mark as played, i need to slide the episode again, or navigate away from the Queue and back to it the &quot;undo&quot; button doesn't work as well First occurred: Version 1.5.0.9 Steps to reproduce: Choose Queue Make sure queue is &quot;unlocked&quot; Slide from left to right on any Episode It displays the little message indicating that the episode has been marked as played. Episode re-appears back in the list To really remove the episode from the list, do one of 2 things: Slide the Episode again OR Go to different view (another list or open an episode), then go back to the Queue view If this is not clear yet let me know and i'll shoot a video, i also answered the questions above about the version and rom.

		I changed from an other podcast app to AntennaPod and I missed one feature. I can setup the maximum number of downloads unter the general settings. But it would be a great feature, if I could setup the maximum number of stored episodes for each subscription separately. I think this option could placed in the context menu of each subscription. And if the maximum is reached, the oldest, not played episode will be deleted. Episodes I've started, but not finished shouldn't count. Example for unplayed episodes: I will have 2 Episodes for Podcast X. I download Episode 001 and after a week 002. One week later Episode 003 is released. AntennaPod should remove Episode 001 and than download 003. Example for played episodes: I will have 2 Episodes for Podcast X. I download Episode 001 and after a week 002. I started (but not finished) Episode 001. One week later Episode 003 is released and should downloaded (becourse Episode 001 is not counting). An other week later Episode 004 is released and AntennaPod should delete Episode 002 and than download 004.

		Hi, since a few weeks I can not play episodes from Resonator Podcast any more. This started with Episode 80. At the moment I have no problems with any other podcast. Greetings Florian App version: 1.5.2.0 (from Google Play) Android version: 5.1.1 (Cyanogen 12.1.1) Devide model: Wileyfox Swift Expected behaviour: Play podcast Current behaviour: Crashes :-( First occured: few weeks ago Steps to reproduce: Subscribe to http://resonator-podcast.de/ Download Episode 80 or 81 Try playing it Environment: If I use sonic the software crashed. The default player just plays static noise. I tried the mp3 and opus version of the podcast with same results. Stacktrace/Logcat: No stacktrace found

		App version: 1.5.0.9 (from Google Play) Commit: a97788a Android version: 4.4.2 Device model: Samsung S5 mini (SM-G800F) Position in audio does not change when dragging slider and slider disappears when paused Expected behaviour: When I drag the slider on the lock screen controls the audio will jump to the position I release it at. Current behaviour: Slider moves but the audio continues to play and the playback position in the audio track does not change. First occured: Current version after switching from a Samsung S3 mini to the S5 mini Steps to reproduce: Start playing a podcast then let the screen lock Press power button to view lock screen Drag the slider, notice that the playback position in the audio track does not change, even though you can move the position of the slider. Press power button to turn screen off. Press power button to turn screen on, notice that the slider has now jumped to the real position of playback in the audio track. Slider disappears when paused Expected behaviour: Lock screen slider always stays visible or at least reappears when play is re-started. Current behaviour: Lock screen slider disappears when the audio is paused. It does not reappear when play is restarted. It does reappear when the display is turned off and then back on. First occured: Current version after switching from a Samsung S3 mini to the S5 mini Steps to reproduce: Press power button to view lock screen Touch the pause button, notice the slider disappears. Touch the play button, notice that the slider does not reappear. Press power button to turn screen off. Press power button to turn screen on, notice that the slider has now reappeared. Environment: I am not sure if I was using Prestissimo. It was installed but the Use built-in sonic media player . . . was checked in the settings. I uninstalled Prestissimo, restarted and retested, results were the same.

		App version: 1.5.2.0 (from Google Play) Android version: Cyanogenmod 11 (unofficial) Devide model: Samsung Grand Duos i9082 Expected behaviour: should sync subscriptions, cancellations of subscriptions and downloaded / played episodes Current behaviour: initial subscriptions sync works, however subsequent new subscriptions/cancellations as well as downloads/plays don't seem to be propagated across devices. While the gpodder.net websites lists a certain podcast as subscribed on a particular device, antenna pod shows no such subscription, I have marked most episodes as listened to but an other device also with antenna pod, synced with it through gpodder shows hundreds of unlistened episodes. First occured: Version 1.x / about x days/weeks ago Since I first tried, which was some days ago.

		App version: 1.5.2.0 (from Google Play), already had the issue in 1.4.2.2 Android version: 6.1 Device model: LG Nexus 5X Expected behaviour: On the &quot;Episodes&quot; Screen I click on the refresh button to check whether new episodes of my podcasts are available. In the status bar Antenna Pod shows a shrinking number of how many feeds still must be updated. After all feeds are updated it shows the message &quot;processing downloads&quot; and after this is closed all new episodes are shown in the &quot;Episodes&quot; Screen. Current behaviour: My feeds are not updated with this refresh function. Nevertheless an update on each feed still works. The message &quot;processing downloads&quot; persists. It seems to do something in the background all the time, because my battery is drained. The only chance to get rid of this is to kill Antenna Pod. First occured: Version 1.4.2.2 / about 4-6 weeks ago/ I'm using Antenna Pod since beginning of year 2016. I already had the same problem in the end of January. I reinstalled Antenna Pod (which fixed the problem). About 4 weeks later, it appeared again. A week later I had no problem anymore, now it appears again. Steps to reproduce: It happens every time I update my feeds. Before it happened the first time, this issue did not occure. I didn't change settings in-between. Environment: I'm using Prestissimo. No Auto-download, Auto-update feeds once a day. Stacktrace/Logcat: The way it described in this wiki, I couldn't get it to work on my phone.

		Sorting the queue &quot;Alphabetically&quot; is not always that useful. Episodes from a single feed are in this way not always grouped together, depending on the episode naming convention. Feature request: Add sorting the queue by feed title + episode publication date, ascending and descending. f1.getMedia().getFeedTitle()+f1.getPubDate().getTime()    // QueueSorter.java
 Add menu item title &quot;Feed&quot; to menu Queue --&gt; Sort. Menu item &quot;Alphabetically&quot; in menu Queue --&gt; Sort could be renamed to &quot;Episode&quot;. Alphabetically is a method of sorting. It does not indicate what is being sorted.

		edit: 04-Apr-2016 @keunes proposed to start a new issue thread in #1795. So this is what I did. App version: 1.5.2.0 (Google Play) Android version 6.0.1 | Cyanogenmod 13 Devide model Samsung Galaxy S4 | GT-I9505 General information Syncing of podcasts feeds and the current (play/pause) state of one or more episode(s) when pressing the update button in episodes and inside the tab &quot;all&quot;. All devices devices, the cell phone mentioned above, and a tablet (Sony Xperia Z4 tablet same AP version from GooglePlay and Stock Rom Android 6.0 (not sure about the version, can't check right know) are registered in gpodder as cell phone. The devices have also the same subscriptions (small icons of a cell phone on the right of each row for each podcast feed listed in the gpodder website). Expected behaviour 1) After starting to stream an episode on the smart phone I pressed play/pause. The expectation is, that AntennaPod is starting the synchronization to gpodder. 2) After that I expected to make an update of all feeds (as described above) on the tablet to get the latest feeds updates and the updates from gpodder regarding the play/pause on the same episode. 3) If I'm marking an episodes manually as played, or if I'm using the gear wheels symbol inside of a podcast feed, I expected that this state of listened/played episodes will be synced to all devices as well Current behaviour Syncing to gpodder is very unstable at all. Sometimes the update is working for new subscriptions. If any new subscription has been added with the podlove plugin on a website, this is mostly working as well. Any edit (e.g. delete of an podcast feed on a Android device) it's not syncing with gpodder. So the change is not present on the website of gpodder or any device. to 1) After starting to stream an episode on e.g. the smart phone (e.g. pressing play/pause), in the status line appears very often the following failure message. German (original message) 1st row | gpodder.net Synchronisierungsfehler 2nd row | Ein Fehler ist beim Synchronisieren aufgetreten: jav.. -&gt; There is nothing else to read English (translated message) 1st row | gpodder.net Synchronization failure 2nd row | A failure occurred during syncing: jav.. -&gt; There is nothing else to read to 2) Same behaviour for the second point as described here in section to 1). to 3) It's not working at all First occured I don't know. It never worked at all. Steps to reproduce See above Environment Tests within wireless LAN connection. Bluetooth off Did the gpodder integration ever worked? Is there a possibility to see more of the failure instead this short message? For that reason I also asked for the pod.care support #1776.

		In the 'PodDBAdapter.java', I see we have listed all the table field names as constants grouped together. It is very hard to understand the DB structure in this way. Wouldn't it be great if we group these so that by reading the code itself, I can imagine the database? To implement this, we could create a static final class which we call PodDBContracts.java. In this file, corresponding to each table, we can create a static inner class which will have that table's field as constant strings. It would make the code more readable and maintainable. Please let me know if this is a welcome contribution right now. I would be happy to send a PR! Thanks, Harshita

		Note: I report this because the timing leads me to believe my issue may be related to AntennaPod, but that’s just a hypothesis and I’not blaming AntennaPod in any way :-) App version: 1.5.2 (from F-Store) Android version: 4.4.2 Devide model: Samsung Galaxy S5 mini Expected behaviour: Current behaviour: First occured: Version 5.1.2 (I think) / about 3 weeks ago This happened to me manually downloading a couple of podcasts. The first two succeeded ; the third one failed with (if memory serves me right) the downloading log mentioning « Wrong EOF » or something. After that, my SD card cannot be mounted by Android as it is « blank or unrecognized filesystem ». (I’ll be okay ; once I get hold of a SD adapter I will try to mount it on a laptop and run fschk or something. :) I’m afraid I cannot give more details on the AntennaPod side as I am now experiencing #1865. Then again, this might just be unrelated timing, or the AntennaPod download failure might have been the consequence rather than the cause of the unreadable filesystem. Thanks :)

		App version: 1.5.2 (from F-Store) Android version: 4.4.2 Devide model: Samsung Galaxy S5 mini Expected behaviour: After a fresh (re)install, sync with gpodder should restore all feeds and played episodes. Current behaviour: After a fresh (re)install, sync with gpodder restores only the feeds, but not the played episodes (all episodes of my 46 feeds are marked as unplayed) (I tried diving into the issues ; there are many related to gpodder sync issues but as far as I could see none pinpointing exactly my particular issue − feel free to merge in case I missed it).

		If you tap on an episode, you get a details view including (I assume) a WebView that displays the description. Swiping left/right switches to the next/previous episode, so it changes title, icon, feed title, duration,... The description gets reloaded (progress indicator visible) but it does not change to the description of the new episode you just switched to. This happens in the playlist as well as in the episodes list of a single feed.

		Dear developers of AntennaPod, I am a student majoring in Computer Science. We are trying to collect existing bug reports and fixes of bugs caused by specific devices to help detect and fix similar bugs of other active applications. We have detected that in your app, method setSupportActionBar of android support library v7 is used in many activities. However, we have observed that invoking this method on some Samsung devices running 4.2 system will crash your app. We have found discussions in in the bug tracking system of Android: here. as well as a stack overflow question: appcompat-v7 v21.0.0 causing crash on Samsung devices with Android v4.2.2 A suggested fix for it is to add -keep class !android.support.v7.internal.view.menu.**,** {*;} to the proguard rules.

		Developers of AntennaPod, Hi, I have found that AsyncTask.execute has been used in many places, like 3 times in GpodnetAuthenticationActivity, one time in AudioplayerActivity, etc. However, this API slows down if multiple tasks are being executed on devices with system version higher than 3.0 because AsyncTasks started by this API are executed serially on a single background thread for systems newer than 3.0. (This is found in the API guide) It will help to improve the performance by changing execute to executeOnExecutor to enable real multi-thread execution. Thanks a lot.

		Hi It looks like the name of the podcast is not mentioned in any of the windows. Some podcasts have decent icons some dont and it is very hard to figure out which feed belongs to which podcast in the queue window or Episodes window or even sometimes in the play window. So I am wondering if it would be possible to add the name of the podcast to these windows so that one can know which feed belongs to which podcasts etc. thanks

 Apparently this doesn't happen when I press the home button. There's of course a quick fix, which is to check for a null playback controller, but that seems to defy the purpose of notifying the media player in the first place.

		Provided test build, ChromeCast Audio, FP2, Android 5.1 when casting, opening the casting dialog and setting the volume via touch interface (swiping on screen) to the maximum value (or 'beyond'): volume bar gets reset to previous volume while the volume actually stays on the maximum (this problem does not exist when using the phone's hardware buttons). Also after closing and reopening the dialog, the wrong volume indication is maintained; the volume indication seems only to be corrected if another episode gets played (at least not upon seek) [https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/1879#issuecomment-211997875] this one can be annoying, but it's not implemented by me. Could be solved in the future, but has the lowest priority in my perspective. [https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/1879#issuecomment-215328484]

			<description>
		Dear AntennaPod Developers, I am implementing a hang-bug detection tool and I am analyzing AntennaPod with it (master version downloaded yesterday). I tested the app with a Nexus 4 (Android 5.1) and Huawei P8 Lite (Android 4.4). I found that the main thread of Antennapod calls: android.database.sqlite.SQLiteCursor.getCount and android.app.SharedPreferencesImpl$EditorImpl.commit frequently when subscribing and opening podcasts. In particular, the above APIs are called as consequence of the two following calls: 1) de.danoeh.antennapod.activity.MainActivity.saveLastNavFragment -&gt; android.app.SharedPreferencesImpl$EditorImpl.commit

2) de.danoeh.antennapod.core.storage.DBReader.getQueueIDList -&gt; android.database.sqlite.SQLiteCursor.getCount
 In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bug) experienced with AntennaPod. As the developers guide of Android suggests, moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. It is actually possible to move those two operations off the main thread using background threads. Therefore, do you think that the smoothness of the app would improve by executing those functions off the main thread? Thanks for any information, I hope I can help improve AntennaPod. 👍 2

		Swiping episodes out of the New Episodes list removes them and claims to mark them as played, but doesn't actually mark them as played in the list for the podcast they are part of. App version: 1.5.2.0 (from F-Droid) Android version: 6.0 Device model: Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, US model Expected behaviour: Swiping the episodes should mark them as played in the full list for the podcast instead of just removing them from the &quot;New Episodes&quot; list and they should not add to the count in the sidebar menu Current behaviour: Swiping the episode removes it from the New Episode list and posts a notice saying it has been marked as played, but it still shows up in the count of unplayed episodes and as unplayed in the list for the podcast. First occured: Not certain. I only recently noticed swiping was an option to mark as played. Steps to reproduce: Swipe an episode (left or right) from the New Episodes list This removes it from the New Episodes lists and notifies me that it is marked as played with an option to undo. If I open the left sidebar the removed episode still shows up in the unplayed count for the podcast (regardless of which feed) If I click on the feed from which I swiped the episode away, the swiped episode still shows up as unplayed (not greyed out) in that list.

Current behaviour: Podcast will start to stream but interrupts after 10-25minutes. The player does not show any infos about the current podcast. Podcast is marked as read and any information about last position is lost. First occured: +12month ago Steps to reproduce: Just select a podcast and click stream. If its a longer podcast it will stop streaming after some time. Stacktrace/Logcat: nothing displayed. do i have to enable something beside running aLogcat in background? Is there anything more i can deliver to localize the putative bug?

		App version: 1.5.2.0 (from F-Droid) Android version: 4.x Expected behaviour: I've set automatic update of feeds every 1 hour (shortest interval). Since I usually have wifi turned off, I would expect that antennapod updates feeds when I turn on the wifi, if at least 1 hour has passed since last update. Current behaviour: antennapod doesn't update when I turn on the wifi network; I have to update feeds manually. Is there a way to have automatic update as soon as a network connection is available? Or have I misunderstood this feature?

		With atom feeds AntennaPod currently loads the image from the logo element. However the atom RFC states logo should be a 2:1 image and icon a 1:1. I think the easiest thing to do would be try to load the image from icon first and then fall back to logo when in the atom NS. Somewhere in this file. However it might be better to allow multiple images in a feed. Then the two images in feeditemlist_header/ItemlistFragment could be different and not just a blurry stretched version of the same image. 👍 1

		My statistics are pretty low numbers so I checked a few feeds. Now I notice that a podcast which I played yesterday for about ten minutes has &quot;0,0&quot; as played hour time (while according to my search engine 10 minutes = 0,16 hours). Also another podcast which I played for a couple of hours only has 0,7 hours as a statistic. I'll keep an eye on it to see if I can find a pattern. App version: 1.6.0.7 (Google Play alpha channel) Android version: FPOS 1.3.6 // 5.1 Devide model: FP2

		This always confuses me until I figure out the the entry is currently playing but paused. Have one entry in the queue Start playing it, then pause Go to the queue and try to remove the entry by long pressing on the list item Excepted: I can remove the entry from the queue Happening: The remove from queue menu item is missing

		A small suggestion: When looking at a track that is downloaded there are two buttons on top &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot;. I'd suggest to renamed &quot;Remove&quot; to &quot;Delete File&quot; as it's not clear if the action will remove the whole entry or when coming from the queue it it removes it from the queue etc. 👍 1

		App version: 1.6.0.9 (Google Play) Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Moto X Play Expected behaviour: If the screen is off pressing the power button should wake the phone. Current behaviour: 3-4 pushes of the button are needed to get to turn the screen on again while Antennapod is open and a podcast is playing. Moto Display is also not working. First occured: Like 2-3 weeks ago. Steps to reproduce: Play podcast Lock screen and let it play for a bit Push the power button to wake the phone. Environment: I thought it had to do with persistent playback controls so I turned them off, also turned off the lockscreen background. The issue persist. Every other setting is still the default.

		I would like for episodes that are &quot;Marked as Played&quot; to be easily visible when looking at the Completed Downloads list. I think the best way of doing this is for the played episodes to be grayed out, just like they are when looking at the podcast feed list. I would appreciate the chance to work on this feature. When choosing which episode to listen to, I primarily choose episodes to listen to from the Completed Downloads list. This allows me to access all the episodes I have currently downloaded, from various podcasts, all on one screen. I also use this screen to delete episodes I have already listened to. Being able to quickly see what is &quot;Marked as Played&quot; will allow me to avoid accidentally replaying episodes that I already listened and to quickly delete the ones I've already heard. I recognize that there is probably a better way for me to do this using the queue and the auto delete function, but this is just how I've been doing it and I think this feature would be useful for people like me.

		Some audio files are not playable with the default player. So it would awesome if there an option to select podcast file and append to the queue of an alternative audio player (playlist) instead of play it with the default player (at the moment &quot;sonic player&quot; or &quot;Prestissimo&quot;). Maybe as an another entry in list like the &quot;set as favorite&quot;, &quot;visit webpage&quot;, &quot;flattrn&quot;, ... &quot;send to VLC playlist queue&quot; or some thing. App version: 1..5.2.0 (from F-Store) Android version: 5.1.1 Devide model: Tablet Expected behaviour: Podcast file sent to an alternative player playlist queue. Current behaviour: Open another player and search manual on SD-Card (.../data/de.danoeh.antennapod/files/). Steps to reproduce: Menue -&gt; Episodes -&gt; (hold an entry) -&gt; view the options of selected file (there would be a nice place for a &quot;send to player...&quot; or &quot;play with ...&quot;

		App version: 1.6.0.9 (from Google Play) Expected behaviour: Download episode Current behaviour: Download says &quot;File Type Error&quot; Steps to reproduce: Add podcast &quot;El Mundo del Spectrum&quot; from http://feeds.feedburner.com/ElMundoDelSpectrumPodcast. Download any of the first episodes (at least from first season, 1x01, for example). It will fail. However, download of last episodes (4x*) work ok. Hi, I've tried many things to see why I can't download some episodes from this podcast before posting this issue to make it more constructive, but I'm not sure which url uses AntennaPod to download them, so I'm afraid I can't help too much. The only difference I could see between a working episode and the others are that the content of the problematic ones uses ISO-8859-1 charset, not UTF8, but shouldn't Android internally take care about the encoding? To verify if the episodes were really available I've tried another closed sourced podcast client and it could download those episodes without problems, so maybe we can find a workaround. I've read some of the issues around here and maybe the PR at #1938 is related. Should I try the nightly apk? Thanks for your help.

		App version: 1.6.0.9 Android version: 6.0.1 Devide model: Nexus 5 Expected behaviour: When downloading, a notification should appear in the notifications area saying that the download is in progress, then either say downloading is complete or disappear (I don't know which because it doesn't get there - see below) Current behaviour: The notification appears for about 0.5 seconds, saying &quot;0 downloads&quot; (or similar - it disappears too fast to read), then disappears, then reappears immediately and continues indefinitely until I go into Settings &gt; Apps &gt; AntennaPod and force stop. First occurred: About 6 months ago Steps to reproduce: Connect to WiFi Wait for AntennaPod to sync Environment: Update interval set to 07:00 each morning Automatic download enabled, including when not charging, no WiFi filter Stacktrace/Logcat: Not available

		Instead of removing subscriptions one by one, it would be convenient to remove all the subscriptions all at once (if you have many subscriptions). Feature request: Add a menu option to remove all subscriptions. Menu option could be located in the top-right corner of the &quot;Subscriptions&quot; view. Note that &quot;Subscriptions&quot; might be hidden from the navigation drawer. Add a dialog, asking the user if he/she is sure to delete all episodes (and the feeds for this device from gpodder).

		App version: 1.x (from Google Play/F-Store/Custom build) F-droid Android version: 5.x [Please mention if you are using a custom rom!] 5.1.1 Devide model: Samsung Note Expected behaviour: Working proxy I put my working Privoxy proxy in the setting and pres test and all I am getting is &quot;test failed:null&quot;. When I watch the logcat for activity, I see no activity when I press the test button. Nothing is printed afterwards as if Apod is not doing anything except &quot;D/WifiWatchdogStateMachine(20590): isPackageRunning - top:de.danoeh.antennapod.activity.PreferenceActivity &quot;. I am not sure if there is a way to debug the proxy here. My proxy works in my browsers. Maybe there should also another buttong that just says &quot;save&quot; so the user can save regardless of what this testing is trying to do. I suspect that it is trying to connect to some google ip to do some testing. thanks

		App version: 1.6.1.2 (from Google Play) Android version: 6.0.1 Expected behaviour: AntennaPod should show the name of the podcast along with the episode title in the playlist. Current behaviour: AntennaPod only shows the episode title. Many podcasts don't have their name included in the episode titles. When these podcasts have episode-specific thumbnails (or very similar thumbs), it is hard to see what podcast the episode belongs to. It would help, if the name of the podcast would also be displayed.

		I just noticed that it is now possible to participate in Beta testing directly from within the Play Store app. These apps will then show up in a 3rd &quot;beta&quot; tab. But it seems these feature must be enabled by the developer. Do you consider to do so?

		When in the Episodes pane, it is difficult to discern which feed some episodes come from if the feed tends to use different images for each epispde. For example, Planet Money's episode image illustrates the episode topic. Expected behaviour is to put the feed name for each episode somewhere in the Episodes list. Downside would then be duplicate/superfluous information when an episode name already incorporates the feed name.

		Dear all, I just discovered Antenna Pod and just love its clean interface, thank you! However, I encountered one problem on my Fairphone FP1 with Android 4.2.2. Sometimes, the last playback position at which I stopped the playback, is not correctly being remembered. This means that upon resume, the playback cursor jumps back to an older position. Can someone confirm this behaviour? Thankfully, ~Robert

		Hi everybody, I installed AntennaPod on my Nvidia Shield TV (newest updates) two days ago and love everything about it except for the fact that I can't get the auto downloads to work. The feeds work, I have a couple of episodes that got the new label and are part of the episodes menu, I have activated auto downloads and everything but nothing get's ever added to the download queue. The only error I can see is that I am using an external hard drive as my internal storage and AntennaPod is showing &quot;/storage/emulated/0 [Error free]&quot; when I want to select the main download folder. However, I can manually download episodes with AntennaPod so this seems kind of working anyway and other podcatchers are auto downloading just fine (just don't want to use them because they work with weird filenames). I would be very happy if anyone could give me a hint on how to fix that or if this is something I have to live with. Best regards, Theo.

		App version: 1.6.1.2 (from F-Store) Android version: 6.0.1 (CM13) Devide model: Sony Xperia M Some podcasts, e.g. 'Naked Security - Sophos' contain both audio pieces as well as pieces that are just links to articles on their blog. In this particular one the ratio is easily 1:10 and it clutters the Episodes list quite a lot. I can dismiss them by hitting the check-mark on the right hand side of the item, but it's getting tiresome. It'd be great to have a way to only show/allow the audio/video pieces in the Episodes list. Personally I'd prefer to have this on by default as I only use AntennaPod for audio/video content, but perhaps someone finds these new blog entry announcements useful(?). Koen suggests addition of 'Has media' to the filter options: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/antennapod/YUMvVzxm-RE/LRtNQDagBAAJ

		Streaming causes the playback buttons, including the notification player, to act sporadically and unreliably when the playback speed isn't 1x. The conclusion I drew from this is that the app itself must be buggy, so for a while I switched. I lated realized that other podcast apps do not even allow the user to have playback control during streaming, probably for this very reason. I understand that fixing the streaming issue might not be a priority, but adding this warning, at least the first time the user attempts this, will probably get more users to stick with the app instead of concluding it must be all around buggy.

		Feature request: I think it might be useful for some people (including me) to have a setting for a sleep timer which is active always when you start playback of an episode because at least I often forget to enable a sleep timer in the evening and when I wake up in the morning my half queue has been played. This could be set in the global settings. I don't think it would be too annoying to press play again when I want to listen for a longer time, for example in a train.

		Hello, I don't want some podcasts to be automatically downloaded. I prefer cherry pick some episodes. So it will be great if we could disable auto downloading at a podcast level. An implementation could be, long press on a podcast, in the menu that appear tap on &quot;disable auto downloading&quot;. Thanks !

		Hello, Sometimes you want to listen your podcasts in a particular order but right now it's now easy. Indeed you only can move an episode at the top or the bottom of the list. So it will be great if we could manually choose the order of the playback list. An implementation could be, long press on an episode, move it wherever you want in the list, release it. Thanks !

		Using Android 6.0 here. I noticed that the MediaStyle notification is not actually triggered. This has two effects on the user experience: The large album art in notifications, which looks like this, is not triggered. The podcast's album art doesn't become my wallpaper when I'm listening to a podcast. I found the reason that this was not triggering: MediaStyle notification only supports up to 3 actions in standard-size view aka contentView (and up to 5 in bigContentView). (See MediaStyle documentation.) The app is currently attempting to display 4 actions in contentView: rewind, pause, fast-forward, and skip. I verified, by testing, that reducing the number of actions to 3 does indeed trigger both large album art and album art as wallpaper. Should we change the behavior of the app so that MediaStyle is triggered properly? If so, we should reduce the number of action buttons. Which action buttons should we remove?

Both playing a downloaded episode and the streaming option let AntennaPod die on me. I tried it out with the latest 3 episodes, I guess it's the same for all of them.

		App version: 1.6.1.2 (from Google Play) Android version: 6.0 Devide model: Moto g3 Current behaviour: On lock screen, the notification bar causes unresponsive behavior. e.g the power button does not always wake the phone. What fixes it: On the settings&gt;lock screen buttons, setting any combination of three buttons (e.g. rewind, pause/play, and fast-forward), generates normal behaviour. Or Disabling moto display. The issue here is with the amount of buttons on lock screen, if theres one or two, the problem is present. Steps to reproduce: Install Moto app Enable screen notifications (Moto display) Start any playback. Environment: Everything on default. Stacktrace/Logcat: I can provide the complete file if needed, but the main issue is caused by the D.MDNotificationListen. 08-22 13:33:08.221 32549-32549/?

		Version 1.6.1.2 from Google Play Store Android 6.0.1 Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo Expected behaviour: Downloads should continue when I switch to another app or lock the screen. Current behaviour: Downloads stop when doing either of these action. Have to restart the download to continue from last download state. Happens for me with the current version since I used it. Steps to reproduce: Start Download of podcast Lock screen Changed no settings and didn't find any to configure that behaviour. Thanks for that app!

		This feature request is somewhat related to #1077 (Option to auto download oldest episode first). The use case is this: A podcast that is &quot;low-priority&quot; that I do not want to download it until I have time to listen. Furthermore, the podcast is serial in nature, so it does not make much sense to listen to the latest episode without first catching up on the older ones. If I can disable auto download on the specific podcast, I can then go to podcast screen and download specific episodes (the oldest unplayed ones) when I have time to listen. Thoughts? How to implement: On the podcast screen, add there is an additional menu item for settings (for the podcast) a new settings &quot;pop-in&quot; screen can allow the users to disable auto download.

		I subscribe to a daily podcast that has each episode of about 140 MB. I had previously requested to have an option to keep only one episode as minimum but it was rejected and the minimum number of episodes to keep is 5. I have enabled the option to delete an episode when it has finished but quite often I don't have the time to watch the podcast on a daily basis. Consequently I see the exclamation mark next to Download every few days and the automatic download stops. I have to manually delete the last 3-4 episodes before the automatic download process restores. The only &quot;cache&quot; option i see in settings is for image setting which I have set to max, 500 MB. Can you please propose a solution to the frequent overloading of the cache? Thank you for a great app! Edit: Sorry, should have added this earlier - Can a per subscription cache option can be included for future, as solution to my issue? thanks.

		If I listen to an episode and it ends, AntennaPod stops playing. Looking at the &quot;Recently played&quot; list, there is the episode that just ended, PLUS the episode that was below it in the queue, even though that one was obviously not played. Expected behavior: Just add episodes that have actually been started (by manually tapping the play icon or by the auto-play feature) Use-case: I delete played episodes after some time (when I'm sure I don't need them anymore). When doing this, I just scroll through the &quot;Recently played&quot; list. It is quite confusing that nearly every second episode appearing there has never been played.

		Sometime happens that one device have a delayed upload of episode action, but the others is already synced, then will be this event never synced, except i delete all date of the app and start from Scratch it is like the http://gpoddernet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/reference/events.html#get-episode-actions &quot;since&quot; parameter is set to a newer timestamp so older event from a delayed upload will be ignored. possible solution in gpodder menu additional to the sync now button, a new one for full sync (ignoring the since parameter) or maybe as long press...

		With RSS the feed description tag only allows plain text, but the equivalent in Atom is subtitle and that does allow HTML. In AntennaPod it gets parsed correctly, but when being viewed on either FeedInfo or OnlineFeedView activities it is just displayed in a textview. The best solution would be to render it in both places, I tried to do that but I don't understand the system in AntennaPod for displaying shownotes. If I could have, I would have done another pull request. The easier but more disappointing thing to do would be to trim the HTML like you do in the OnlineFeedViewActivity for shownotes.

		This enhancement adds two preference settings to the application preferences to control the delta when clicking fast forward of rewind. Currently these values can be changed by long pressing on the fast forward/rewind button, but this is somewhat hard to discover. This enhancement adds these preferences to the &quot;Settings&quot; view. 👍 1

The affected pull requests include (at least): #2119, #2117, #2130, #2096 ... CircleCI errors: Your build has exceeded the memory limit of 4G on 1 container. The results of this build are likely invalid. We have taken a snapshot of the memory usage at the time, which you can find in a build artifact named memory-usage.txt.

		Summary: In episode playback screen (see screenshots below), sometimes &quot;Share Link&quot; and &quot;Share Link with Position&quot; menu items are missing (in the sub-menu of Share ...) are missing. No pattern has yet been identified. App version: 1.6.1.2 (from Google Play) Android version: 4.1.2 Devide model: Samsung Galaxy T-599H Expected behaviour: See the screenshot. There should be 4 menu items: &quot;Share Link&quot;, &quot;Share Link with Position&quot;, &quot;Share Episode File URL&quot;, &quot;Share Episode File URL with Position&quot; Current behaviour: See the screenshot. Intermittently only 2 out of 4 menu items are present: &quot;Share Link&quot; and &quot;Share Link with Position&quot; would go missing. Steps to reproduce: It appears intermittently. I cannot reliably reproduce, but it happens to me frequent enough to notice.

		App version: 1.6.1.2 (from Google Play) Android version: 6.0 Expected behaviour: Only one feed file per subscription in the files/cache directory. Current behaviour: If you have two subscriptions that share the same name, then every time the feeds are downloaded, the file &quot;feed-${PODCASTNAME}&quot; is updated and a file named &quot;feed-${PODCASTNAME}-${I++}.&quot; is added to files/cache wasting many megabytes after a while. If you have three subscriptions with the same name, two additional files are created. If you have four, three ... TIA for fixing!

		App version: 1.6.1.2 (from F-Droid) Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Nexus 6 Expected behaviour: Pause, Jump Forward (30 s), Playback Speed buttons in the 'Now Playing' window and notification window do their intended function Current behaviour: The jump forward button work from one to a dozen times and then stops working, additionally the pause button stops working. This means if the audio is playing I need to Force Stop the app. The buttons do give the animation effect that they are being pressed when I tap them even though they do not work. First occured: At least 3 months ago, I believe even longer. Steps to reproduce: Open app Press play beside an item in the queue Press the jump forward button 1-12 times None of these buttons (jump forward, pause) work anymore Note that it seems I can pause and play the podcast many times and that it is only the jump forward button that causes this problem. I have tried multiple podcasts that all have this effect. I am not sure if it is related, but the playback speed should change when I tap it but it does not. When I long press it, I can see I have selected the speeds I want but tapping it does not cycle through them. Environment: Nothing special Thanks!

		The subscription list in the nav bar is currently sorted case sensitive. I had one podcast at the bottom with a lowercase title, I've now renamed it but the sort should probably be case insensitive. Maybe it should also ignore &quot;The &quot; prefix? I think most media apps ignore it when sorting.

		I just installed the android auto app, it would be nice if I could control the playback of my podcasts through it. I think this is the relevant info: https://developer.android.com/training/auto/audio/index.html I realise this is probably pretty low priority, but I thought I would put it here. Thanks for a great app.

		App version: 1.6.2.2 (from F-Droid) Android version: 4.2.2 Device model: Samsung Phone Expected behaviour: antennapod should not crash :) Current behaviour: as soon as I upgraded from 1.6.2.1 to 1.6.2.2, antennapod started crashing very often, with the popup message &quot;Unfortunately antennapod has stopped&quot;. Sometimes it happens right after starting the app. Sometimes it happens right after pressing play on a podcast episode: the episode keeps playing in the background, but it stops as soon as I click &quot;OK&quot; to dismiss the popup message &quot;Unfortunately... etc&quot;. Sometimes I can listen to a podcast, but it crashes right after I try to listen to a different episode. I never experienced this behaviour in any previous release; they all worked OK up to (and including) 1.6.2.1. I didn't make any changes to my configuration. (BTW, unfortunately it's not possible to downgrade directly from 1.6.2.2 to 1.6.2.1, the install procedure in F-Droid exits with an error; so one has to uninstall the app, and re-install it) Stacktrace/Logcat: Here's the content of crash-report.log I'm sorry I can't remember which kind of situation triggered this particular crash (at startup, or after pressing play); let me know if you need more details or examples and I'll try to get a crash log for each situation.

		I have been noticing this with several podcasts since the statistics feature was introduced, but was waiting for a very good example to be sure − got one now :) I have just started a new podcast − I listened to the trailer and two episodes − one of 44min and the other of 36min − and started a few seconds of another one. I only ever listen at 1.0 speed. The statistics tab, for that podcast, indicate 3.5 hours. Tapping the podcast indicates « 4 out of 10 episodes started. Played 3.5 hours out of 2.1 hours. ». I really do not see where these numbers would come from. When listening to podcasts, I very very often rewind 15s or so and was thinking this may me confusing the counters, but for this particular podcast, I listened to both episodes in one go. Found another example : a podcast where I only listened to the trailer (1.30min) and to the first 15 minutes of the first episode (of 39min). The statistics indicate « 2 out of 5 episodes started. Played 1.2 hours out of 0.7 hours. ». Same, only 1.0 speed, no rewinds, no re-listens. Since I use gpodder I can probably extract from the API my exact listening patterns of these two examples if that helps. Let me know if I can provide more information! App version: 1.6.2.2 (from F-Store) Android version: 5.1.1 Devide model: Samsung Galaxy S5 mini (SM-G800F)

		I can't really say when it was introduced, but since a while AntennaPod is featuring an preview of the coming episodes from the playlist in the android notification area. Let's call it Playlist-Preview until i do know a better matching name. The attached picture shows the notification and has a yellow highlight for the particular new section. I would love to see if users could enable or disable this yellow-marked section - as it is really eating up a lot of space from the notification area. App version: 1.x (current from Google Play) Android version: 6.x [Resurrection Remix] Devide model: Moto G 2015 Expected behaviour: Make playlist preview optional Current behaviour: playlist preview is not optional First occured: unsure

		Hi, since the last update I always get the warning if I am sure, that I want to download over mobile data, though I am connected to my wifi. If I confirm, podcasts are downloaded over wifi properly. Not that I do not like that warning in general, but I don't understand why this is shown to me via wifi. v. 1.6.2.3 from F-Droid Android 6.0.1 (CM13) tested without iptables rules and with (AFWall+) device: Samsung i9100 occurred after last update

		App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 GT-I8160 (UK) Expected behaviour: When a new episode is published, AntennaPod checks a configuration element to see whether it should be added to the play &quot;Queue&quot;. Only add to the play queue if this option is enabled, otherwise perform other configured actions, e.g. download but do not add to play queue. Current behaviour: All new (downloaded?) episodes are added to the play queue. Justification for feature request: I have a wide range of podcasts that are configured to automatically download new episodes as they are published. When I decide to listen to podcasts, I want to chose the episodes that I want to listen to which may not necessarily be all the podcasts downloaded, e.g. I may want to listen to some comedy on my walk to the station in the morning but a drama on the train journey home in the evening. I want to define the play list for my listening manually. Proposed implementation: I suggest a global Boolean configuration element, &quot;Automatically add to play queue&quot;. This could be asserted by default to retain current behaviour, i.e. not change default behaviour of application. It may be advantageous to add a per-subscription option to override the global setting but I think the global setting is required. (My preferred workflow is to have no podcasts added to the play queue by default.) This setting may best be placed in the &quot;QUEUE&quot; section of the settings menu. (The settings menu is rather long so it may prove advantageous to add a sub-menu for queue management but that is not the subject of the feature request.)

		Intermittently but regularly when selecting the subscriptions view, many subscriptions are not shown and a thick blue bar, the width of a subscription tile appears. Touching the screen where a subscription tile should be sores open the subscription so it seems to be a display issue. App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 4.1.2 Devide model: Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 GT-I8160 Expected behaviour: Selecting &quot;Subscription&quot; view shows a tile for each subscribed podcast. Current behaviour: Selecting &quot;Subscription&quot; view shows only some subscribed podcasts and other disruption to screen. First occured: Since I first used the App which was with this version. Steps to reproduce: Click on menu then &quot;Queue&quot;. Click on menu then &quot;Subscriptions&quot;. Repeat until occurs.

		Dear all, Your app is fantastic! Thank you so much. :-) I use it on the following device: Huawei U8666E Android 4.0.3 Baseband version 2030 Kernel version 3.0.8-perf-00271 I experience the following problem: I start to play an episode I open the dropdown menu (swipe down from the top) I click on the &quot;pause&quot; button to pause the episode I close the dropdown menu I open the dropdown menu again I don't see a play button but still the pause button. Clicking on the pause button doesn't trigger any action How can I further debug this? I would expect to see a &quot;play&quot; button to continue with the playback of the episode. Thank you for any help you can offer me! Yours, -Robert

		Hi AntennaPod team, Problem: Bluetooth crashes as soon as I press play. &quot;Unfortunately, Bluetooth has stopped.&quot; Behavior still occurs when Bluetooth is just on and not connected to any other device. If I close the app and restart, the problem occurs again. If I restart the phone, the problem still occurs again. I have (multiple times) cleared cache and data for the Bluetooth app and tried again, and the behavior still occurs. This behavior is limited to AntennaPod. Bluetooth does not crash during operation of other audio player apps such as Poweramp or stock music app. Expected: Bluetooth does not crash when I press play. (The occasional Bluetooth crash is expected, but I do not expect it to crash every time I press play in AntennaPod.) First occured: About 3 months ago. Has occurred since, every time I enable Bluetooth and press play. Steps to reproduce: Turn on Bluetooth Open up AntennaPod Select a podcast and press play Bluetooth crashes &quot;Unfortunately, Bluetooth has stopped.&quot; Also occurs if AntennaPod is opened before Bluetooth is turned on, or if Bluetooth is turned on while podcast is playing. App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 4.4.2 Device model: LG G3 D855 Environment: Sonic media player enabled, no Presstissimo. Stacktrace/Logcat: I send the latest crash report to myself via email and here it is: [ Environment ] Android version: 4.4.2 OS version: 3.4.0-perf-g4a750c6 AntennaPod version: 1.6.2.3 Model: LG-D855 Device: g3 Product: g3_global_com [ StackTrace ] java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to retrieve AudioTrack pointer for pause() at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:1480) at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:1426) at com.aocate.presto.service.IPlayMedia_0_8$Stub$Proxy.pause(IPlayMedia_0_8.java:778) at org.antennapod.audio.ServiceBackedAudioPlayer.pause(ServiceBackedAudioPlayer.java:501) at org.antennapod.audio.MediaPlayer.switchMediaPlayerImpl(MediaPlayer.java:588) at org.antennapod.audio.MediaPlayer.access$100(MediaPlayer.java:35) at org.antennapod.audio.MediaPlayer$4$1.run(MediaPlayer.java:403) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:841) Thanks in advance for your help and please let me know if you need any more information.

		Orbot provides an API to start the TOR service and send data through it. You can find examples of it being used in F-Droid, SyncThing, and the Duck Duck Go app, among others. This would allow for privacy protection on downloads that you don't need to happen very quickly. Its essentially the perfect use case.

		The filter icon on the feed item page looks more like a sort icon. I just had to search a minute to find out why the podcast has &quot;Filtered&quot; written on top of it (it was not filtered, but adding and removing a filter removed the message). So I think the filter icon should be easier to recognize as such.

		If the download service is killed by Android or a taskmanager, restarting the download creates a second file. The old one stays in the media folder without any reference in the database.

		For this bug to happen you have to stop playback somewhere in the middle, then stop the app. When you reopen the app the progress bar is completely filled, like if you stopped right at the end of the episode, although the progress should be somewhere in the middle. App version: 1.6.2.3 (from F-Droid) Android version: 7.1.2 (LineageOS April Build) Devide model: Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 Expected behaviour: Progress bar should show the current playback position after reopening the app Current behaviour: Playback progress bar is completely filled First occured: Version 1.6.2.3 (first time I observed this) Steps to reproduce: Start playback of an episode Kill the app (it must be completely stopped) Open the app -&gt; Progress bar is completely filled When you tap on the progress bar and then go back the playback position is set properly Environment: only difference to default is night theme Stacktrace/Logcat: n/a

		Hi, i am using AntennaPod on my phone since several month. While running vanialla (moto-version) Android 6.x it was stable and worked as expected - as a result i really love this application as it covers whatever i need from a podcast app. Since upgrading to Android 7.x (Lineage) i got the impression that AntennaPod is running pretty unstable for me. I found similar problem reports in the Google Play comments concerning Antennapod stability issues on Android 7. Some crash examples: App is crashing while downloading new episodes App is crashing while playing Crashes might happen in different styles: App is silently closed (usually when display is off) App is crashing showing an Android dialog that antennapod was closed offering option to reopen it or ignore until next boot (usually when display is on/active while crash happens) App is crashing as part of a soft-reboot of the device (usually when playing and display is off) To get a better impression about the run-times between crashes i'll add an example/excerpt of my today crashes Example crash history 16:58 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 16:59 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 17:00 - App closed silenty while playing with display off I was wondering if it changes if i do have the display running/on - so i kept using the phone for the following minutes 17:07 - App closed with OS crash dialog while display was on 17:12 - App closed with OS crash dialog while display was on Back to having display off 17:18 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 17:19 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 17:20 - App closed silenty while playing with display off App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 7.1.2 [Lineage] Devide model: Moto G 2015 - Osprey Expected behaviour: Antennapod should play episodes without crashing Current behaviour: Antennapod is crashing First occured: According to my impression it started since Android 7.x Steps to reproduce: Hard to tell, usually i am really just listening to something having the display off. Environment: Episodes are stored on external sd card (tried 2 different cards so far) Stacktrace/Logcat: I do have a logcat output of this crashes mentioned above, please tell me if you want the full, or just :W, :E or :F to reduce the logcat clutter. I would love to offer any additional information needed and help as far as i can. Please let me know whatelse might help you.

Current behaviour: Downloads fail with this error: IO Error: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found
 First occured: Today, same version. Haven't changed anything on my phone. I found this issue, but unlike that issue, I can't find any SSL/TLS/HTTPS certificate trust path errors on SSL Labs: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=streamer1.afa.net I see that their cert expires in 9 days, but that shouldn't cause this. Note: I am able to download these podcasts with Firefox on Android without any problems. e.g. this URL works fine in Firefox but not in AntennaPod: https://streamer1.afa.net/tracking/streamer1.afa.net/afr-aod/sandyrios/sr_20170508.mp3 Thanks for your help.

		App version: 1.6.2.3 Android version: 7.1.1 -- Lineage OS (latest) Devide model: Moto E 2015 Surnia Expected behaviour: The number next to &quot;Episodes&quot; in the side bar should match the number of new episodes in the scroll area. Current behaviour: The number next to &quot;Episodes&quot; is always one more than the number that are visible. When no episodes are available, it still shows &quot;1&quot;. Steps to reproduce: I just upgraded from CyanogenMod to Lineage by reflashing the device (not an inplace upgrade). After installing AntennaPod, I restored its files from a backup with adb and set the permissions/SELinux context. Everything works fine other than this episode count is wrong. Is there any way to get AntennaPod to reset this count? Or does this number indicate something else is wrong? When I store the podcast files on an external SD card. When I first started AntennaPod after restoring its files, it started to download new episodes before it had permission to write to the SD card. I deleted those episodes (in the app) and then downloaded them again after granting permission. I don't know if this could somehow be related -- maybe it thinks there is an episode in internal storage still?

		App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 7.1.2 [LineageOS 14.1, 20170522, N2G47O] Device model: LG Nexus 5X Expected behaviour: Expanded notification should contain: the currently playing podcast control buttons (all four) queue section with upcoming podcasts (up to 3). If only two more episodes are playing after the current podcast, expanded notfication should show currently playing podcast but only two items. If no podcast is in the queue, expanded notification should look like normal notification (but with additional control buttons) with no separate queue section. Etc. Etc. Etc. The ability to turn off or change the number of queue items displayed in the the queue section of the expanded notification would be nice also. This section takes up half of the screen, and even if functioning, it would be nice to be able to reduce the size of it. Maybe I am unclear as to the purpose of this section, because there are no options that deal with this queue section of the notification. Current behaviour: Expanded notification queue does not update in real time, and first three items will display until queue is empty. First occured: I have only been using AntennaPod for a week. Steps to reproduce: At the end of the day, I have listened to all podcasts, so queue is empty. Overnight, podcasts autodownload and are added to queue (more than 3 podcasts). When I start playing podcasts in the morning, The expanded notification shows the currently playing podcast and the queue section shows the currently playing podcast (again) and the next two queue items. These queue items will stay the same until queue is empty again.

		I have noticed that some of my feeds are over HTTP, even when there can be HTTPS. Probably that is an error with the person who edited the iTunes page. Removing the podcast and re entering it by hand would break the play history. Thus there should be a way to edit it. Even nicer it would be a way to make Antennapod check if there is a HTTPS version available and updated and automatically switch to the more secure version.

		gpodder.net is currently down (their homepage has a maintenance message). When I searched for a podcast, I got an error about getting a bad response code 503. I happen to know that's an HTTP error code, but it would be super nice if AntennaPod could display a better message - something like, &quot;gpodder is unavailable. Try again later?&quot; (I'm happy to provide version info, etc., but I figured it wasn't necessary since this is an enhancement request, not an actual bug.)

		App version: 1.6.2.3 (from F-Droid) Android version: 4.1 Device model: Wiko Cink PEAX 2 Expected behaviour: When there is network issue, the partial download should be deleted. Current behaviour: Once during a download there was a network issue. The download failed and a partial file was left. (e.g. foo.ogg) When the download was retried the partial download file wasn't removed. And the new file was foo-1.ogg The in app player still played the complete file (foo-1.ogg) When the episode was deleted it was the complete file (foo-1.ogg) But the partial file was foo.ogg was still there. So not a big deal but in case that might help, the info is here :-) It might be useful if more people get files that stay in the app directory. (feel free to close as won't fix if the ratio time/value*fun isn't there) First occured: 2017-07-01 This is the only occurrence Steps to reproduce: I didn't had the time to try to reproduce. Environment: I disabled &quot;Update Interval or Time of Day&quot; (I'm not sure if it was by default enabled)

		iVoox is a huge plataform for podcasts, I think it would be very nice to have some kind of implementation on AntenaPod in this aspect. I thought about: Adding a searcher (https://www.ivoox.com/{insert}_sb.html) Adding some kind of easier way to suscribe to a feed just introducing the website. Eg: https://www.ivoox.com/podcast-magonia_sq_f15884_1.html → https://www.ivoox.com/magonia_fg_f15884_filtro_1.xml (note: podcast-, sq fg, 1.html filtro_1.xml) Thank you so much for this excellent app!! 👍 1

		AntennaPod is my go-to app for listening in the car. Unfortunately it doesn't integrate well with Android's automobile technology. Instructions for supporting discovery and playback from Android Auto are found Here. Requirements Some labels in the Manifest file A conditional in alarm management to only trigger if not in Car mode Harder Stuff Implement the Queue as a MediaBrowserService Enable playback through a MediaSession Allow voice commands to control playback

		I have six podcasts already subscribed without problems. When attempting to subscribe to The Guardian's Brexit Means..., I got a message in Antennapod's download log saying &quot;IO Error: open failed: EINVAL (Invalid argument)&quot;. The message did not specify which file name it complained about. The only bug looking vaguely relevant I found was #268, but that's supposed to be solved, and the podcast's name doesn't contain a colon. However, it does contain an apostrophe, which may or may not be legal in FAT32. Sure enough, if I change Antennapod's storage to internal I can subscribe to the podcast. App version: 1.6.2.3 (from F-Droid) Android version: 6.0.1 (Fairphone Open 17.07.6, not rooted, without Google services) Device model: Fairphone 2 Expected behaviour: The podcast should be subscribed, no matter the storage back-end Antennapod uses. Current behaviour: If storage is a FAT32 external SD card, the podcast is not subscribed, and a message saying &quot;IO Error: open failed: EINVAL (Invalid argument)&quot; appears in the download log. First occured: Version 1.6.2.3 was already installed the first time I tried, on August 5, 2017. Steps to reproduce: Go to Settings -&gt; Choose Data Folder. Select your external SD card, formatted with FAT32 (e.g. /storage/1234-ABCD/). Go to Subscriptions -&gt; Add Podcast. Enter https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/brexit-means/podcast.xml in &quot;Add Podcast by URL&quot; 4.1. Alternatively, click &quot;Search FYYD&quot;, enter guardian brexit and click the first result. Click &quot;Subscribe&quot;. Environment: Auto Download is enabled on WiFi. When Antennapod is configured to use the external FAT32 SD card, the download fails. When Antennapod is configured to use internal storage, it succeeds.

		Using AntennaPod 1.6.2.3 -- trying to download any episodes from a soundcloud podcast feed fails. The log shows Unknown host: Unable to resolve host &quot;feeds-tmp.soundcloud.com&quot;: No address associated with hostname. However, if I look at the the contents from a feed URL (http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:264034133/sounds.rss) in a web-browser, there is no feeds-tmp host, but only URLs with feeds.soundcloud.com, which when pasted into a browser redirect properly and download an episode mp3 file.

		App version: 1.6.3.0 (from Google Play) Commit: b1bb29d Android version: 7.1.1 Device model: Lenovo Moto Z Expected behaviour: Continuous audio output when playing several items from playback list. Current behaviour: When using a Jaybird Freedom headset, most of the time when AntennaPod skips to the next podcast in the playback list, the audio output is silenced though the podcast is played. You have to pause and restart playback in the app to unsilence the audio output. Pausing and restarting with the buttons of the bluetooth headset doesn't solve the problem. Using a MPow Bluetooth receiver does not show this behaviour. Steps to reproduce: Connect the Jaybird Freedom Headset Play podcast When AntennaPod skips to the next item most of the time it silences the output. Pausing and unpausing in the app resolves the issue. Environment: Jaybird Freedom Headset various playback speeds (1.75 up to 3.0) Sonic Media Player Headset disconnection/reconnection enabled Bluetooth reconnection enabled pause on interruption restart after call

		If try to download sounds from a feed of ximalaya, such as the following, http://www.ximalaya.com/album/242836.xml, it fails. If try to play one sound from the feed, it fails too, and the app just hangs there and will not play sounds from the normal feeds. In fact, the play interface won't react to any operation, so i think feeds from ximalaya is something like poison. If I want to make the app wake up and play sounds from the normal feeds, such as the following, http://feeds.podtrac.com/zKq6WZZLTlbM, I must clear the data of it from the app manager.

		App version: 1.6.3.0 (from Google Play) Commit: b1bb29d Android version: 7.1.1 Device model: Lenovo Moto Z Expected behaviour: Navigation notifications should pause playback, play and unpause afterwards when using bluetooth headsets. Current behaviour: When using a Jaybird Freedom headset (a2dp-profile) listening to podcasts with AntennaPod and using Google Maps or e.g. Komoot as navigation app does not work as expected. Whem there is a navigation announcement the playback pauses, then there is silence for some time and then the playback unpauses. BikeCitizionGuide works like expected. I don't know if this is a issue with AntennaPod, Android or the way the navigation apps work. Steps to reproduce: Connect the Jaybird Freedom Headset Play podcast Start navigating with Google Maps. Navigation announcements remain silent. Environment: Jaybird Freedom Headset various playback speeds (1.75 up to 3.0) Sonic Media Player (doesn't matter) Headset disconnection/reconnection enabled Bluetooth reconnection enabled pause on interruption restart after call

		I sometimes want to download one episode from a podcast without subscribing to the entire podcast. The subscription screen already shows available episodes for a podcast. What's needed is a download button on this screen next to each episode. The episode would appear in the downloads list and the usual queue. App version: 1.6.2.3 Android version: 8.0

		Ever since the Android 8 update I've had podcasts suddenly start playing for no reason. On one occasion it started in the middle of the night. On another I went back to the room where I left my phone and found it merrily playing away. I think it might have been on charge on both occasions, but not just put on. Twice it's happened while I've been reading a book in the Kindle app. My sleeping wife was not amused! Strangely, it seems to start at the beginning of a podcast, not where I last left off. The resume on headphones/Bluetooth feature still gets that right.

		I have AntennaPod set up to skip forward in time not tracks, but after the upgrade of Android OS to the latest 8.0.0, the behaviour changed. &quot;Forward button skips&quot; is turned off. App version: 1.6.2.3 Android version: 8.0.0 Device model: Nexus 5x Expected behaviour: Car &quot;Forward&quot; button should skip 30 seconds forward Current behaviour: Skipping to next track First occured: When I upgraded OS. Steps to reproduce: Press button on my steering wheel :) with bluetooth connected. This Than that Then Environment: [Settings you have changed, e.g. Auto Download. &quot;Unusual&quot; devices you use, e.g. Bluetooth headphones. Do you still use Prestissimo?] Stacktrace/Logcat: [if available]

		App version: 1.6.2.3 from Google Play Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Expected behaviour: When gpodder sync fails, I'd like to be able to see some information why (e.g. if there were a log viewer inside antennapod, it could say &quot;connection timed out&quot; or at least some http status codes like 503 or 418 or whatever). Current behaviour: Just says &quot;Last sync attempt: Failed (2 minutes ago)&quot; First occured: Version 1.x / about x days/weeks ago 3 minutes ago Steps to reproduce: Try to sync with gpodder when I guess gpodder is down but I can't tell because there's no log info Be unable to tell what is wrong Environment: [Settings you have changed, e.g. Auto Download. &quot;Unusual&quot; devices you use, e.g. Bluetooth headphones. Do you still use Prestissimo?] Just subscribed to a podcast and logged in with gpodder (successfully logged in it seems, since gpodder.net shows my device) Stacktrace/Logcat: Can I do this from inside the app?

		Is there any way to disable the functionality where holding down the volume button skips and marks done an entire track? This is a really frustrating feature. Several times, I've gone to raise or lower the volume, only for AntennaPod to skip the entire track, mark it played, and delete the downloaded file. It's really subtle and difficult to avoid, because doing a single volume press doesn't usually cause this, but accidentally holding the volume it down for even one whole second does cause it. I can't see any option under the settings to change this. Is this a feature in AntennaPod or is it built-in to Android?

		When/how is a new release for AntennaPod decided? I ask because I am encountering a lot of issues with adding podcasts from iTunes due to feedUrl json exceptions. This seems to have been resolved in this commit: 99588bb Unfortunately, the nightly builds are quite old and not include this commit. Is my only recourse to clone the repo and build the .apk myself? Thanks for the help. 👍 5

		App version: 1.6.2.3 from Google Play Android version: 8.0.0 Device model: Pixel Expected behaviour: AntennaPod only plays when I ask it to :-) Current behaviour: AntennaPod will start playing some episode I've listened and finished recently. Usually one I've finished listening to. The only way to prevent this is to delete played episodes. Events that seem to trigger this include connecting to a car via Bluetooth Audio, and certain Play Store updates (I don't know if the Antenna Pod pod itself or some services, like the Web View or Google Services). Because of this bug AntennaPod has started playing in inappropriate situations, such as in the middle of the night and while my phone was charging on my office desk. This seems to be related to issue #2425, as the episode plays in the same hidden mode that requires killing the app. First occured: 4-8 weeks ago Environment: [Settings you have changed, e.g. Auto Download. &quot;Unusual&quot; devices you use, e.g. Bluetooth headphones. Do you still use Prestissimo?] Headphones Reconnect and Bluetooth Reconnect options are disabled. So is Keep Skipped Episodes. This happened many times both with Bluetooth Audio and without headphones. I don't discard that it could happen with headphones, I just never experienced it, because the I don't normally do the things that have triggered this problem while the headphones are connected.

		Hi, I found API AlarmManager.set() is used in UserPreferences.java to schedule the alarm to update the feeds automatically at some time. For your information, from API 19, the alarm scheduled by this API may not be triggered at the exact time you set. It may be delayed due to the system scheduling. So, the update may be delayed. To have on time alarm scheduling, you may use setExact or setWindow instead. Thx.

		App version: 1.6.2.3 from Google Play Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Nexus 5 Expected behaviour: MP3 with non-ASCII character in filename will be downloaded Current behaviour: MP3 with ø in filename fails to download First occurred: This is the first time I noticed it. Steps to reproduce: Find a feed that has an MP3 file with ø in the filename. Attempt to download the MP3. Observe that it fails. Consider trying with other non-ASCII characters and repeat. Environment: No special environment Screenshot: Notes: The podcaster has renamed the file as a workaround: I have hopefully resolved the issue, as if AntennaPod had an issue other players may have the same issue. If it still doesn’t work for you after a couple of hours from now, please let me know and I will continue to try and troubleshoot it. From your screenshot it looked like it had the issue with the ø character in Stian Veum Møllersen’s name that I had in the name of the mp3 file. I renamed that file and replaced and the ø with a o, and told the cache to expire, so if it doesn’t refresh for you as well, please let me know. As far as opening a issue, it may be worth it just to let them know that it doesn’t like the encoded ø in the URL.

		App version: 1.6.4.1 Android version: 7.1.2 LineageOS build 14.1-20171023-NIGHTLY-d801 Nova Launcher for home screen Bug also exists using the default Trebuchet launcher Device model: LG G2 Expected behaviour: Text color is easy to read on the grey widget background The podcast name is shown. In the attached screenshot, you can also see a weather widget and another podcast player widget. Both provide transparency, have white text and are easier to read. Ideally provide the user with a way to customize the widget colors / transparency as other widgets do Current behaviour: Details text is in black which is hard to read against the grey background. There is less contrast on the actual screen than in the screenshot. The widget background and text stay the same regardless of wallpaper. The name of the podcast isn't shown. First occurred: Immediately on installation of AntennaPod today Steps to reproduce: Install AntennaPod Long press the screen to add a widget and select the AntennaPod widget

		App version: 1.6.4.1 Android version: 7.1.1 Device model: Moto Z Play (2016) Expected behaviour: Notification dissapears, when process finishes. Or at least I can swipe the notification away. My real expectation is: I'm not even interested in this notification, since it only shows useless information about some background processing. I don't want to see that. Current behaviour: The following notification remains for hours and hours and can't be swiped away. Only killing the application hard removes the notification. In German: &quot;Lade Podcast-Daten Verarbeite Downloads&quot; My english translation: &quot;Loading Podcast-Data Processing Downloads&quot; First occured: Steps to reproduce: I have automatic update with download active to download during the night. The next morning, I see the stuck notification. Environment: [Settings you have changed, e.g. Auto Download. &quot;Unusual&quot; devices you use, e.g. Bluetooth headphones. Do you still use Prestissimo?] Auto Download is active, also when on battery. Only in Wifi. No Wifi filter. Auto Download happens at 3:00am same time every day.

		Hi, I try to make a PR for support Android O and this sucks Why do you have a 'core' module with same flavors ? In our company we merged the modules (and if you want you can separate it with packages) and the result was a easier build script and faster build times. If you like a merge of modules, I can make a PR and add support Android O too. Please let me know ! PS: I just ask to save my time, because a lot of open source projects are not very open to new ideas.

		I bought a new device and after transfer data from old to new device by Google setup, AntennaPod is installed on new device -great- but all data are lost -bad- Is there a way to export/import (or other transfer) from old device to new device ? I ask because it's probably more efficient to ask here instead of searching in the code. Thank you !

		I have the Nexus 5X running Android 8.0 and antennaPod 1.6.4.1 . Did a factory reset and only have a couple other non factory apps installed. First let me say I tried all the podcast players out there and this was by far the best. I really loved this program until recent and wish I hadn't updated to android 8. Today it just got so bad I couldn't take it anymore thats why I'm opening a bug report. So many problems I don't know where to start. 1 Randomly just starts playing when plugging into the charger Randomly starts playing if I let call go unanswered while plugged in to charger Randomly starts playing after using the camera and then turning screen off and putting in pocket. 2 Sometimes starts up playing multiple pod casts at the same time including the last podcast I listened to thats marked as played and shows download only. Update - Today when it began to play on its own I discovered that it was playing the same episode over top of itself. The episode began simultaneously playing from where I left off and also from the very beginning. How can that even happen? 3 Today it just started playing when I turned the display off and I couldn't shut it off. None of the playback control buttons would respond and it continued to play even after I closed all programs. I had to open up android settings, all apps, and manually stop antenna pod to get it to shut down. 4 Sometimes when restarting an paused episode the playback will start completely over at the very beginning instead of where I left off. 5 This problem has me even more confused because I'm not sure whats to blame. The same podcasts I been getting from Itunes using the same unchanged home network take much longer to download. A podcast that use to take 2 min now takes 30 minutes. Very frustrating. 👍 2

		It is not reading my episode list, playback history, subscriptions, or queue. Near as I can tell these are all still on the device. Or at least something is taking up that space. Force stop and clear cache did not fix. Attempting reboot now, but I fear I've lost my subscription list.

		It would be nice to have an option to Archive Podcasts. Archiving a podcast would mean there won't be any more updates and the podcast would be moved to a different section than the Subscriptions. This way, a dead podcast or a podcast that is uninteresting at the moment would be both stopped and the user will not lose the read status, the place where a certain episode was stopped, the list of favorites, and so on.

		App version: 1.6.4.2 from Google Play Android version: 6.0 Device model: Huawei P8 lite (ALE-L21) Expected behaviour: Play any podcast episode Current behaviour: AntennaPod freezes or just does nothing. First occured: 1.6.4.2 Steps to reproduce: Play any podcast episode Environment: Tried with headphones, with internal speaker and bluetooth. Tried with Sonic Media Player and without. Tried with different speeds. All changes had no effect. Last system update for the Huawei was done about a week ago. I can not verify if the system update or the app update caused the problem. Stacktrace/Logcat: No stacktrace available Please let me know how to help you with this. AntennaPod worked fine a week ago on that device.

		Hello, thank you for the great app. Would it be possible to group podcasts in something like folders?

		Hello, I've got a recurring problem I can't seem to find anything about, though I might not know what I'm looking for. The app runs fine and I love it, but I keep getting a failed download error and I have no idea where it's coming from. The error is 'unsupported Feed Type: Invalid type' and the podcast listed is http://rmc.fr I have no idea what that is or how to get rid of it. From a Google search it looks like a sport talk radio show or some such. I just want it to stop trying to download whatever this is but can't figure out where or what it is. Could be a virus for all I know. If I'm missing any information, please just ask. Be aware I'm only moderately technically proficient so I might have to ask a lot of questions. Any help in fixing this issue would be great appreciated or even an idea about what is going on. Thank you for your time and consideration. App version: 1.6.4.2 Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Honor 5x running EMUI 4.0 Expected behaviour: Current behaviour: First occurred: It's been happening for months and I'm just now getting around to trying to fix it. It's been a busy year and this is a very minor annoyance. Steps to reproduce: It does this on it's own when it updates my podcasts which I have set for every 8 hours. Environment: It's set to only download podcasts on WiFi. All my podcasts are set to auto download the newest episodes.

		On larger screen it is kind of hard to reach top right to tap refresh button. Pull to refresh would be ideal.

		Dear team, when I take a look in the Google Playstore, the app's current version is 1.6.4.4, in F-Droid the current version is 1.6.4.1 What's the reason for this difference? Is there a bug in the building process? Please fix that. Kind Regards, Krawei
