			<description>
		Right now only words or titles starting with the query are returned, not weighted in any way. See the Google I/O app for a better implementation (however keep in mind that porter only works with English language). Also: query table size concerns... A little background: the search table is completely recreated each time something changes. This is due to reaching optimal size. Optimizing or just updating the table increases size by a huge margin. (Anyone have a solution there?) When hitting the search button while showing season x of show s, only episodes from show s which are in season x should be shown.

		Update shows like it is suggested in the tvdb API docs. Make sure new episodes get really added. Strategy: maybe only check for updated shows (type=series) and then download info for the whole show to make sure new episodes are added, too. Is a series id listed also when just episodes were updated/new ones added?

If the tvdb overhaul doesn't turn out to be fixing the air time time zone issue we might as well switch completely to trakt on the backend (however this would be an extreme measure).

		Use the ViewPager when episodes are displayed inside there own activity (currently only in portrait mode on non-xlarge devices). It worked alright in a prototype but it remains to be seen if this may need improvements on the episode image loading code. A minor bug has already been discovered (the background image does not seem to always load correctly when swiping), so changes to the EpisodeDetailsFragment will likely be necessary.

		Hi Uwe, i have found another issue in your app in the episode-listview. the Actionbar menu and the menu entries in the bottom(hardwarekey)menu will be duplicated if the device gets rotated multiple times. There are also some issues for debate. And therefore i will not open an new official issue: If i click Watched all, also episodes will and can be marked as watched, that are in the future or there airdate are unknown. Calendar Export: you can export episodes to the calendare that are in the past. And in The Show-Overview you can export to calendar if &quot;no next episode found&quot;. To the 2nd &quot;issue&quot; its also fair to say &quot;keep the menu entries consistent to the user&quot; all the time. regards, David Wiesner 2.5.3beta (dbver 24) Android 2.2

		Hello everyone, I'm trying to figure out why the SeriesGuide app keeps crashing everytime I run it. I tried installing the app via google play and downloading the apk from github. I tried all the available apk and the result is always the same. Conditions: Samsung Spica running a custom 2.2.3 20 Mb available on the phone memory. App is installed and running from the phone memory No network available. What happens The app starts, and for a few seconds it works but then it crashes. The logcat says it died with the Signal 11 (SIGSEGV) I can see the Get started Screen. If I don't do anything it will keep crashing with the signal 11. If I click the dismiss button on the Get started Screen I can play around with the app for a few seconds (2 or 3). After a couple of relaunches I start seeing SQLite errors (could't open seriesdatabase for writing) Any thoughts?

		With how the suggestion system is currently designed in Android it is as far as I researched impossible to add per-activity filters like one can do by overriding onSearchRequested() for regular search. An alternative would be to turn off suggestions for search inside OverviewFragment, but guess what, AFAIK not possible. If anyone has viable solutions, I'm listening. E.g. you could create another SearchActivity which handles just searches from OverviewFragment. This way you could specify a different selection. However I still have only the user query as dynamic parameter, no?

		When entering a shows overview screen or any episode detail screen we should check if that show has been updated in the last 24 hours (make that a little less as users won't check exactly every 24+ hours). If not, we'll update it in the background potentially leading to destruction and chaos. Ok, rather super-class the hosting activities than the fragments. If not each EpisodeDetailsFragment would try to start an update, that seems like too much background noise.

However if really every event which would trigger a calculation is covered (which is done more easily with an event bus) there would be a lot of potential for speed ups by not having to run a lot of background threads to update UI state. Show list next episode (goal: update only single shows as needed): After any updates to a single show (TVDb and trakt): episode or just description can change Potentially if marking an episode watched/unwatched anywhere Season watch counters (goal: update only single season counters as needed): If marking an episode watched/unwatched anywhere After any updates to that show (TVDb and trakt sync) How granular should we go? Only tell that a part of a show, a season or even an episode was updated?

		Up until now there are multiple people (I know of) experiencing this problem. The trakt API just returns {&quot;status&quot;:&quot;failure&quot;,&quot;error&quot;:&quot;bad user&quot;}
 despite users being able to login on trakt.tv. The trakt guys don't seem to really know what's going on there, so this can be seen as a notice for future incidents. If you experience problems when interacting with any trakt part of SeriesGuide (connecting an account, syncing, etc.), please log debug output (e.g. with CatLog) while you repeat the failing action multiple times. Look through the logs for any TraktException or the string above. If you confirmed your problem is the above, it would help if you could drop your trakt user name to support@seriesgui.de so we can maybe at some point establish a pattern. If not file a new issue or just drop a mail.

		Just another idea to help indicate which show you're currently checked into, assuming it's possible to get your checked-in state (which I'm guessing it is since I've seen the timer saying you have so and so much time left before you can check in again). Basically, the check in button is it's original gray color, and once you're checked into a show, it becomes the newer purple color, and the label changes from &quot;Check In&quot; to &quot;Checked In&quot;.

		When we check into an episode while the previous checkin isn't finished, we have that message telling us to override or to wait x minutes. But it still checks in on GetGlue. Maybe it should wait the press on that override button to check into the new episode.

		Hi, I read the feature requests that deal with recommendations, and it seems, recommendations will not be implemented in SeriesGuide to avoid bloating. Still though, I came to rely on SeriesGuide when it comes to what is on currently/recently/coming up and I visit trakt.tv rarely (read, never), so I could be missing something. My suggestion for manageable recommendation list would be to show whatever the list initially is on trakt.tv, for each item have an add/ignore choices, so that user can clean up the list manually. If the user is not interested in cleaning up the list, then also 'have a 30-days old recommendations are cleared automatically' policy to clean up the list on the device to avoid bloating. There could be an optional notification, when new recommendations arrive in the list. Does it sound reasonable enough?

		The TVDb search API exposed to third-party applications is much worse than what is offered through their website. Shows are not found for partial title Shows are not found where only a non-English title exists, except if the search language is expressly changed to that language (e.g. SG 'Content language' setting) No autocomplete Examples: PSYCHO PASS C Money Control Hopefully the promised new API will solve these problems. Update: trakt is planning v2.0 for mid-2014 with potential international support and better search. Hopes are up!

		It's not possible to mark episodes as seen when an account for trakt.tv is configured an no internet connection is available. I don't have always an internet connection on my nexus 7 but would like to use the trakt service anyway. Maybe SeriesGuide could postpone the request to trakt until next sync.

		In the &quot;Unseen/Upcoming&quot; view, if the last aired episode has been marked watched, the show disapears from this view. For me this is a little missleading, I thought this filter or view would display all shows, which have unseen episodes. But I can also understand the purpose, for example if someone step into a show later and don't want to watch all past episodes. Maybe its posible to add a per show setting to control this or a complete different view.

		Hi! First of all thanks for your amazing work on this, I have gladly supported you by buying X version. However, there is what I am missing badly - I do use this app for tracking my progress in shows that has been already published. You have a data set showing next unseen episode of each show to be displayed on homepage. I am not sure what you call this data set in English version, it's third option in select on homepage. It would be great to choose this set to be displayed by widget! :) Thanks for your work! Tom

		Steps to reproduce: Open ShowsActivity rotate device select e.g.: Favorites in dropdownmenu The problem is that the field mFragment is not set if savedInstanceState is not null (e.g.: after rotating the device). To solve this problem, you can set the field mFragment, on every time the ShowsFragment is attached to the FragmentActivity by override onAttachFragment in ShowsActivity @Override
public void onAttachFragment (Fragment fragment) {
    if(fragment instanceof ShowsFragment){
        mFragment=fragment;
    }
} or add another elseif clause in the onCreate regards, David

		Quoting Tom: I tried to create a list name with a dash (&quot;-&quot;), as soon as I typed the dash, the already entered text would disappear. I found if I tried to first type some other symbol (say &quot;=&quot;), it wouldn't display, but the text also didn't disappear, and now typing a dash also didn't cause the text to disappear. Fix the filter. I had a look at the filter for the text field, but couldn't find anything wrong so far. So far it resets to &quot; &quot; when entering a dash or an uptick. Allow dashes (check if the create id algorithm will not fail and still produce uniques).

		Hi, I'd love to have possibility to switch season on screen with list episodes. I was thinking that it would be nice to be able to use ActionBar.NAVIGATION_MODE_LIST to display list of seasons and quickly switch it. Reason of this request is that I watch &quot;whose line is it anyway&quot; in random order and I often check if I already watched that episode, and it's pain to click back and select another season. I could write pull request if you like that. Best Miko

'Episode %s'

 and insert the number into the variable string at the appropriate code line.

		Go into a shows overview, try to flag the episode shown as watched. Nothing happens until you press back to return to the show list. Not yet confirmed with trakt disconnected. Likely won't fix this legacy platform bug as it works fine on consecutive actions, this seems to happen only the first time.

		Currently widgets are updated roughly every 5 minutes when the device is awake (REPETITION_INTERVAL = 5 * DateUtils.MINUTE_IN_MILLIS). Granted, at least the update is not performed when the device is asleep, but I find the 5 minutes interval unreasonable short considering that series times usually don't change at all during the day. Hence it would be nice if the widget update interval was customizable, or at least if the current 5 minutes interval could be reduced to a longer interval.

Add library, basic purchasing activity Include and construct app key Create and verify developer payload Query existing purchases on app launch/resume Extract string resources Refine layout (e.g. progress bar) Remove in-app-billing debug messages X migration Purchased upgrade unlocks X features. Beta and X will unlock without purchase. Build SeriesGuide X update which notifies users, helps to move database. Use alpha and beta testing in the Android Developers Console to do beta testing. User can sign up for it, which will also hopefully lead to more feedback. Postponed

I get this on both my nexus 7 and nexus 4 which are both running stock android 4.2.2 straight from google. I have also sent about 6 crash reports from directly in the app so I kind of hope you got them Its pretty simple to replicate all you have to do is switch to that section and clear everything in it here is a video of me making it crash on my nexus 7 (sorry about portrait mode) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX8Q67_e8Ho

		At various points (dismissing trakt check-in progress dialog, moving to next fragment after connecting to trakt) it is required to perform fragment operations only after a background task is completed. However, the user might have left the app in the meanwhile. So a fragment operation in the background will fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can not perform this action after onSaveInstanceState exception.

		I would like to have the ability to choose a different sorting method. For example: i can sort by A - Z. I would like to sort my series based on the first letter starting after &quot;the&quot; (thus ignoring the word &quot;the&quot;). That way, a serie like &quot;the big bang theory&quot; would be sorted like B, not like T and would be far more up in the list. Can this be added as an extra sorting option?

		This one is pretty weird, never seen it before. I think it has to do with the SGH lib, but I'm not sure in what way right now. I only think so because it doesn't show up when you have infinite scrolling turned on and therefore no SGH. You can't actually grab it, but if you grab the right side, while the left one is still visible, both will drag. To reproduce: Go the Activity (make sure infinite scrolling is turned off) Quickly scroll down, when you hit the bottom you'll see it occur Screenshot

			<description>
		When I unwatch the last episode seen in a show, the next episode SeriesGuide tells me to watch is not the good one. (SeriesGuide version 7.2-beta1) Steps to reproduce the bug: Add a show (I'll take Family Guy for example as it has a lot of episodes). Let's say I have seen the whole season 1 and the first episode of season 2, so I flag them all as seen. Next episode SeriesGuide tells me to watch is now 2x02, as expected. I accidentally flag episode 2x02 as watched. I then flag episode 2x02 as not watched yet in the seasons section. Go back to the main screen (when you see all your shows), SeriesGuide now tells me that the next episode of Family Guy I have to see is : 11x04 (???) To go back to normal, go to the seasons section of the show, find season 11 and, with the action button on the right, flag all the episodes as &quot;watched none&quot;. You can reproduce once again that bug by flagging the next episode to see as seen and flag that episode as not watched yet. SeriesGuide will always tell you that, with my example, the next episode to see is 11x04. Why 11x04? I don't know... Looks like that bug happens to the shows with multiple seasons (I can reproduce this problem with Simpsons show, Futurama or The Wire). I don't know if I was very clear with that bug, I'll provide a video if needed.

		While I appreciate the switch in v9 beta, which moved the update progress bar below action bar, now it looks awkward (at least with the Android Dark theme), because the divider is there all the time and when update is in progress, it just adds right below it, making the line two times that thick, (moreover, the divider stays intact and the progress bar animates, which looks weird, given they both have the same color in the mentioned theme). It would look much cleaner if the divider was replaced by the progress bar during update - the line would stay the same thick and the animation would look much better.

		Currently up to the last 10 ratings are cached for episodes in TraktSummaryTask, using a LRU strategy to evict old entries. Meaning, even if some time has passed, the cached value will still be returned instead of refreshed. Potential solutions: Clear the cache after a timeout.

		There is no way to remove movie from watchlist or add it from movie details activity. Right now this option exists only in lists. This is not very convenient if user decides to do one of these actions after viewing details about a movie. He'll have to go back to list, find item, open context menu, and click on a button. It would be nice to have them in details activity.

		First we had #346. Now with v11, which introduced GridView mirroring in RTL layouts (style in layout-ldrtl-v17 folder) those are again incorrectly used by some 4.1.x tablets. This leads me to believe that those tablets will use any folder that has the highest version qualifier (in this case v17, which is Android 4.2.x), ignoring if it is higher than their API level. Screenshot from user:

		Hi, The widget is able to display &quot;upcoming&quot; episodes that are in the future, and &quot;recent&quot; episodes. But, back when there was a Seriesguide and separate Seriesguide X, I think it was possible to display only unwatched episodes that have already been aired. Hopefully this feature can be revived. I think it would be very convenient if there is another category &quot;Unwatched&quot; for the widget that simply shows unwatched but aired episodes. If all aired episodes have already been watched then the widget can just be empty for as far as I'm concerned. Right now, in my opinion the widget is too cluttered because of the future and recently aired episodes. I'd like to be able and see my own progress in one simple view. Or is that possible and is this something I am consistently overlooking? Regardless, the app itself is great and it's been a lot of fun to see the progress in development. So, kudos for that. 👍

		The nav drawer toggle indicator's default gray color doesn't look too good on the new purple action bar. I can't say for sure, but I think the various Google Play apps use a white color tinted with the respective app's action bar color (e.g., white with a hint of orange for Play Music or red for Play Movies). Or maybe it's just a transparent white.

		When you fast scroll between episodes,this bug sometimes occurs. For example, swipe right then swipe left rapidly to switch between 2 episodes. I can do a screen record if you want. My device: Nexus 5, Android 4.4.2, with SeriesGuide 13.1. In the enclosed screenshot, I swiped to the second episode and then quickly went back to the first one.

		After changing the filters, it triggers an update. This should NOT happen, as this is handled completely by the loader framework and this code has remained untouched a while. Misinterpreted bug report. Show list cutoff for unwatched episodes is not refreshed on activity re-recreation as old loader is apparently re-used, ergo the cut-off is not updated to the current time, ergo shows with just released episodes do not show up. Original report

		If the library has a lot (=hundreds) of shows, calculating the total watched time can be slow.

		I couldn't get into the community forum so trying this method. I am very familiar with trakt and have been eagerly awaiting the upgrade, especially v2 of the API. I am assuming the recent upgrade has caused the problems I am seeing. Essentially no communication with trakt via SeriesGuide. Have enjoyed using your app and happily paid the unlock cost. Just like to know if I'm correct wrt trakt and wonder what your plans may be if I am. Please advise.

		Hello, First of all, I'm using French UI so some messages might not be translated exactly as it is in English UI. Plus, when I say check I mean marked as seen, I don't use the check-in feature. I noticed today after going on a TV show details, that it updated seasons and episodes as it always does, but this time lots of episodes were removed from “seen” in front of my eyes, even random episodes from other seasons that I watched months, maybe years ago. It happened to lot of TV shows but I will just take one as example: Case Closed. Some episodes from season 7, half from season 22, and the whole season 23 were marked unseen. So I looked on trakt and indeed they weren't marked seen. So I checked all seen from season 7 and 22, and checked first episodes from season 23 that I did watch. I got message “7x seen. Sending to trakt” as I always get. No error from catlog. I got back on trakt, season 7 was OK, season 22 and 23 were still missing. You can see in my history that I indeed just checked episodes from season 7: http://trakt.tv/users/yurienu/history and that season 22 and 23 are missing: http://trakt.tv/users/yurienu/progress I tried again a lot of times to mark season 22 seen but I kept getting the Sending to trakt message with no error. Is it possible that it has something to do with international titles? Thank you for your help,

		Reported on G+ When adding a show, AddShowTask does not abort if loading watched/collected episodes fails. It probably shouldn't. Old train of though: sync will add watched/collected episodes. However, with the new v2 syncing algorithm this might not be true any longer all the time.

		Hi I am new to this app so it might be that I just misunderstand the filter, but as far as I understand it it should only show shows with unwatched episodes. However, when I apply it all shows (including those with unwatched episodes and those with all episodes unwatched) are hidden. I suppose that's not how its intended. Since I see nobody else reporting this, maybe it was introduced in today's update.

		Suggested on uservoice Mostly concerning submitting to trakt (database doesn't care) which will create new watches for already watched episodes. &quot;Set all older watched&quot; should only set unwatched/skipped &quot;Set watched&quot; for season should only set unwatched/skipped and released &quot;Set watched&quot; for show should only set unwatched/skipped and released Exclude specials when changing watched/collected state of show Side effects: breaks set watched season/show for episodes with no release date set increase in data sent to trakt (used mostly on seasons or shows that are completely unwatched, maybe check if number of episodes sent for season = total number of episodes in that season, then send only season) hardened against episodes on trakt not in SG (will only set watched what can be seen in SG)

		Reported on G+ The API might return a 404 if it can't find an episode. Then it would be easy to intercept the RetrofitError and show a different error message. Also look at movies.

		I think various green status appearances can be painted with the primary purple color. New show. Show. Show overview. Season The green color seems out of place actually, because all colors are either purple or white or grey. My original intent was to make a pull request, because it seems like a not finished theming for me, but naming of R.attr.textColorSgGreen and R.style.TextAppearance_Subhead_Dim made me think it is intentional.

		Reported on G+ (Posters) Reported on G+ (Titles) If connected to trakt, Now tab uses show posters and English-only episode titles from trakt. Try replacing these with the TVDB (local) version in TraktRecentlyWatchedLoader and the friends equivalent, if the show is in the local database. Notes Might be a worse experience if there is a mixture of localized/English content.

		When loading data any view inside SwipeRefreshLayout is not drawn (including the progress indicator). Only once data loading is complete drawing resumes. Removing the SwipeRefreshLayout completely fixes the issue. Investigating... Notes: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78191 nope, has no effect. seems related to how SRL draws, making test project for bug report. Not related to high CPU activity of one or more AsyncTaskLoader (tested using loaders which do Patter.compile() iterations before passing dummy data). Next: possible related to network activity

		Since trakt's recent site wide update, the only way to access their movie/show recommendation engine is view the api. Since SeriesGuide is already OAuthed for a user, this provides a unique opportunity for SeriesGuide to be the first/easiest way for someone to take advantage of this feature. Provide a section or feature called 'suggest a movie/show' in which the trakt recommendation engine is polled by SeriesGuide http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/#reference/recommendations/get-watched-history

		Hi. Developer question: I see from the changelog that it used to be possible to directly search TheTVDB - but this was disabled. I'm curious about ideas and thoughts on using SeriesGuide without trakt.tv login. There is another open source Apache 2.0 app out there for Android that has direct integration with TheTVDB - https://github.com/tarzasai/Uoccin Is there any reason to be against having a mode that is pure TheTVDB?

		I don't know if this is an intended behavior, and if it is feel free to close this, but please read below first. Since some version in September it is not possible to refresh any show's information if the permission &quot;GetAccounts&quot; and/or &quot;GetAccountsByType&quot; is blocked, in my case by XPrivacy. I see this as a regression, since the ability to get this information isn't (or shouldn't be) related to any account at all, as it is freely available, and it was working perfectly fine before. My best guess is it has something to do with the commits on or around September 10th, but I haven't looked too deep in the code to see where this is coupled with the ability to update the shows. If this is an intended behavior I kindly ask you to reconsider, since this is just an artificial dependency (it was working before) and there are people who value privacy and don't see the necessity of sharing information about what accounts they use with a show tracking app, or the necessity at all to couple updating shows information to a private account, specially if they don't use any of the features for which an account is actually best used for (cloud sync, etc.). Thanks!

		It's possible for the FAB to be displayed on the &quot;now&quot; tab as a result of the FabAbsListViewScrollDetector getting confused about which Fragment is currently being shown. Personally, I don't like hiding the FAB, but I'm not sure how you'd like to handle it. An easy fix would be just to check to see if the grid has focus or not:     if (!view.hasFocus() || totalItemCount == 0) {
        return;
    }
 Also, what are you thoughts on switching to an actual Snackbar instead of your custom one? Is there a reason for using it?

		The number of unwatched episodes for one season of my shows does not match number of episodes I have not currently watched. Attached a screenshot showing the issue: SeriesGuide is reporting that I have 26 unwatched episodes, but the count in the top right shows I have seen 144 of 308 episodes (this number is correct, the 26 unwatched episodes is incorrect).

		Here's an example with the show Wonderfalls, but this works with any show that aired in the 'wrong' order. Set 1x05 Crime Dog (DVD 5.0, aired 23/07) and all older episodes as watched Next Episode is now 1x07 Muffin Buffalo (DVD 6.0, aired 23/07). It jumped 1x06 Barrel Bear (DVD 7.0, aired 27/10) After setting 1x07 as watched, Next Episode is now 1x11 Cocktail Bunny (DVD 11.0, aired 25/07) Is there a way to make Next Episode follow the sorting order selected in the episode list(if we're watching the show on Netflix, DVD or any other source that isn't TV)? Sometimes setting a special episode as watched makes SeriesGuide jump whole seasons, because it aired in the middle of the show.

When I mark an episode as watched directly from the list, watched episodes from a seemingly random show pop back into the list. trakt is connected does not occur with &quot;Infinite calendar&quot; OFF turning off &quot;Hide special episodes&quot; helps This is likely caused by trakt sync which deletes all watched flags, then applies the downloaded ones.

		I really like the idea of trakt syncing in SeriesGuide. While SeriesGuide is my preferred tool for organizing my viewing, mirroring that history to an online, shared database with social features has a certain appeal. However, the reality of the current trakt syncing feature — as it exists in SG v.30.0.1(Database v38) — falls somewhat short of that ideal, and is making me consider disabling the trakt syncing just to restore some usability to SeriesGuide. Here's my typical SeriesGuide experience, with AutoUpdate enabled and SeriesGuide connected to trakt (only, not Cloud): Launch the SeriesGuide app, which usually takes me to Recent as that's the tab I was last viewing. The spinner at the top of the tab begins twirling as SeriesGuide starts syncing with trakt. Various shows begin transiently appearing in the list, as SeriesGuide &quot;resets&quot; their watched status before applying the state downloaded from trakt. (This is bug #487) If I attempt to mark any episodes (of any show) as Watched during the syncing process, those watched flags will more often than not be lost by SeriesGuide when it finishes syncing. (This may relate to bug #458 — @pironic writes &quot;Occasionally I find that under some conditions outside of the SeriesGuide pervue, shows and movies are scrobbled twice.&quot;, but I find that most of my duplicate activity is caused by SeriesGuide, when it loses Watched flags and I re-apply them, only to later find out that I've created duplicates.) Several minutes after syncing starts (this is no exaggeration — the syncing spinner can last anywhere from 45 seconds to 2, 3+ minutes), the update completes and I am able to make changes in SeriesGuide without them being lost. I realize that what SeriesGuide can do in syncing with trakt is constrained by the trakt API, and that ideal efficiency may not be possible given those constraints. But I feel like something at least needs to be done to make the syncing (a) more asynchronous and (b) less disruptive, so that SeriesGuide can be used while it's going on. The situation in bug #487 — where SeriesGuide manipulates the live datastore during the syncing process, removing and reapplying the entire Watched history for a show instead of simply making updates ­— feels like a prime candidate for refactoring and improvement. As some data points on my situation, SeriesGuide is running on a Samsung Galaxy S4, not exactly a slow or resource-starved device. (And I'm running SlimKat 9.0, a CyanoGen-based Android 4.4.4 — not Samsung's dog-slow stock OS.) It connects to the internet over Sprint's 4G LTE network in New York City, which typically gives me SpeedTest numbers of 6 - 12 Mbps down, 4 - 6 Mbps up. In every sense, performance is as good as can reasonably be expected. To give you an idea of my datastore, this is what SeriesGuide is working with: So, I'm far from a light user. It's entirely possible that I simply have too much data in SeriesGuide, and syncing it all to trakt is just too intensive a process. However, most of those shows are fully watched and Hidden, simply there for historical reasons. There's no reason to expect that they'd be receiving updates. If necessary I can delete the historical data from SeriesGuide, though it would be preferable if that info could simply be excluded from the syncing process in some way, rather than having to be discarded. It's also possible that having active shows on my list like Saturday Night Live (41 seasons / 810 episodes and counting) and The Simpsons (27 seasons / 602 episodes and counting) makes the syncing process unduly heavy. But, short of canceling those shows, I'm not sure what I can really do about that, so if that is indeed a problem then it would appear to be another way in which the syncing process is ripe for improvement. (I haven't even considered adding really high-volume shows like The Daily Show to SeriesGuide, even though I do watch it regularly.) SeriesGuide is a really great tool, and the trakt integration, while intriguing, would be a wonderful feature if only it didn't interfere so greatly with the app's performance and utility.

		So there are some TV shows with the same name, e.g. The Flash 2014 and The Flash 1990. I think it's more convenient if we (extension devs) can get the release year or the release date of the show through com.battlelancer.seriesguide.api.Episode. Really hope you can implement it.

		Occasionally while scrolling the Recent list, I accidentally tap a checkmark next to one of the entries, marking something as Watched that I didn't intend. Since the entry immediately disappears, usually before I can notice what it was, I'm left with only the &quot;XxYY Seen. Sent to trakt&quot; message at the bottom of the screen as a hint as to what I just accidentally removed from the list, so that I can hunt it down and un-mark it. Sometimes that's easy, as there are other episodes of the same show nearby and the &quot;hole&quot; is obvious. Sometimes it's far from obvious, and requires substantial digging. It'd be handy if the &quot;checked-in&quot; message stuck around slightly longer than it does currently, and either provided an &quot;Undo&quot; function directly, or (failing that) was tappable to navigate to the episode in question, so that it could be unmarked. (Currently, attempting to tap on the message just selects whatever list entry is below it.) This is in line with, e.g. GMail's list features, where immediately after an action is taken, the success message includes an Undo link in case the action was made in error. 👍 1

		Like outlined in this issue here the calculation of the estimated runtime is slow. The problem is you have to keep the device screen on while calculating else it will reset and start over. Which is kinda bad if it takes 15 seconds or more to calculate. Same thing if it calculated and you switch of the screen.

		Regarding the new popup menu displayed after pressing the tick icon; please consider removing it, adding an option to disable it, or making the popup menu only show up after long pressing the tick icon. The default action for the tick icon since it's creation has been setting an episode as watched and the addition of this popup menu does nothing more but add an extra step to the process of doing this. Myself and from what I can tell many other users do not use the &quot;check in&quot; or even the entire collections features meaning that it really does absolutely nothing but add an extra step to what used to be a 1 button process. I'd also like to point out that &quot;set watched&quot; isn't even the first item on the popup menu making it really easy to accidentally press the wrong menu item since it's between two others. I personally don't update all the episodes I've seen right after I've seen them meaning that when I do enter the app I'm planning on setting quite a lot of episodes as watched and this popup menu quite frankly makes it a really annoying pain in the butt. It doesn't help that the popup menu actually covers up the next episode that I want to set as watched so I have to search for the icon again and try not to be too fast or else oops I just added it to my collection. I'll also point out that when I opened the app today to set episodes as watched I managed to accidentally add an episode to my unused collection because I pressed the tick icon expecting it to do what it's always done but instead causing the popup menu to show up over the next tick icon I wanted to press causing &quot;add to collection&quot; to be selected instead. I can go on and on about how much I absolutely despise this feature and want it to burn if you need more motivation to kill it. Though trying to be a bit more level headed, I think it would just be a better idea if you made the popup menu show up on long press of the tick icon instead of changing the default action that icon has had since I believe forever.

		So I wanted to set an Episode to watched and got the following error: &quot;Could not talk to trakt. Try again later.&quot; I tried again later and still the same. Then I noticed the Episode is still missing in the trakt Database and is only on tvdb. Maybe there should be error reporting that accounts for this so trakt VIP users can go on the site and refresh the data.

		Since lists aren't synced to Trakt, it would be a good idea to provide users with the option to export their lists to a file (OPML, if that is the right format) and import it into the app at a later point in time or import on another phone. (This is a feature request, I am not familiar with the stack that this project uses / how the episodes and lists are stored, so I am sorry if I am making a basic mistake in the understanding. That said, I am familiar with Android and I will look at the code and find the right portions.) @UweTrottmann Is this a feature that you would be interested in?

		As actions are now published as broadcasts previous versions of SeriesGuide no longer work. Update SeriesGuideExtension to handle both cases, probably by checking the component that is sent which should receive the action. If it's a receiver, send a broadcast, if it's a service, start the service (only pre-O of course). Better idea: send API version through extra. Use that to decide.
