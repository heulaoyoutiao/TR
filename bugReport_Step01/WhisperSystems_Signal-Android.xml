		While performing a license analysis on the source code I found a conflicting EULA in res/raw/eula. It has problematic areas, like the software is only available for non-commercial use, and some of the terms are probably considered a &quot;further restriction&quot; under the GPL. My hope is that this file was just overlooked and wasn't supposed to have been included in the distribution.

		The current default for TextSecure is to display the keyboard when you go to view an SMS. This takes up a lot of screen real estate and makes reading the messages a little more difficult than it should be. This is down to the text area being in focus when you go to read a message The ideal solution to this would be not to defailt to having the text entry area in focus and instead let the end user decide whether they need to type a response and in which case the keyboard will open.

In the &quot;top&quot; text message screen where all the different threads with different users are shown, the messages from others are readable in white om a black background. Links in text messages from others are still readable in the thread view. They are blueish on the black background.

		After installing TextSecure from market, everything runs smooth and TextSecure works as intended. However after a reboot of the phone wifi works, but gsm/3g has no connection/error. There is a message &quot;The process com.android.phone has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again&quot;. After another reboot the problem insists. After removing TextSecure and rebooting, everything works as expected again.

		(email addresses changed to prevent spam and whatnot) Steps to recreate: long click a message click 'Forward message' type in email address in the 'To' text box : a@aaa.aa Click 'Send' When I type in aaa@aaa.aa it works great. When I type in a@aaa.aa, I receive the toast error 'Recipient is not a valid SMS or email address!' When I forward to the 'a@aaa.aa' address using the android built in text message program, I can send the message fine, and when I send it from TextSecure, it goes to aaa@aaa.aa perfectly. So, I don't believe it to be an issue with the OS or the email function of TextSecure. The problem seems to be in line 8 of src\org\thoughtcrime\securesms\util\NumberUtil.java The regex, ^\w-+[\w]+@([\w-]+.)+[A-Z]{2,4}$, seems to be requiring three letters for the left side of the email. I think this is in contradiction of RFC5322 (page 17) and real email addresses in use today.

		First let me start off with my specs: Phone Model: HTC Dream Android version 2.2.1 Kernel Version: 2.6.36.9-cyanogenmod replicant@replicant-builder #1 Mod version Replicant-2.2 (See replicant.us) I have successfully setup textsecure with my brother. However during a phone call with him the call was dropped and I rebooted my phone. During this time he sent me a text saying &quot;call me&quot;. However once my phone rebooted I received the normal text messaging app went off and the text was routed there. However because it was encrypted with my key it just appeared as a bunch of ciphertext. This also happened with a friend of mine.

			<description>
		When ran for the first time, TextSecure allows the user to import the existing SMS database into TextSecure. But later, there only is the option of importing/exporting a TextSecure SMS database, and nothing to re-import the standard SMS database (useful when the user did something wrong and wants to start over) It's kind of an issue: you can still clear all TextSecure data from Android and start over, but it also resets your keys… So, it would be cool to be able to trash all existing TextSecure SMS and re-import the standard SMS database, all in one go and without resetting the keys.

			<description>
		When launching TextSecure for the first time, it allows one to import the standard SMS database. However, this process can take quite a long time (tried with 3000+ SMS). The screen has the time to turns off, and when you turn it on again, TextSecure asks again if you want to import the standard SMS database. If you say &quot;Yes&quot; again, a lot of messages are duplicated… The easiest fix would be to inhibate the screen saver, but it wouldn't handle more complex cases (such as the user launching another program while TextSecure is processing the SMS)

		Recently due to my own ignorance and the Mrs being away I quickly amounted ~1000 messages in one thread. At which point I think I must have hit a database / memory issue. TextSecure could not accept any new messages (it straight rejected them) but equally had no memory so I couldnt delete a single message or an entire thread at once. The only way to resolve the problem was to go into the Settings menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; TextSecure and delete TextSecure's database. I'd prepose a &quot;max thread length&quot; in the options, most other text programs allow you to set a max length of say 100 messages.

		I occasionally use Google Voice (GV) for texts, or texts are sent to my GV number. Those texts are received by the GV app directly. It would be nice to be able to encrypt/decrypt messages sent through GV. Local storage should be encrypted, but most of the messages would be stored (encrypted) in GV instead. (This is likely a large undertaking. If I have the time, I may try to tackle this on my fork.) 👍 1

		For Nexus S and other devices that don't have an SD card, it would still be nice to enable import/export functionality. One can't very easily access the application's data via USB storage mode, and without an SD card the export menu item just returns an error. Related: is it possible to import old messages just using the raw messages.db file? Does TextSecure work if you backup using adb backup and restore using adb restore?

		When TextSecure's passphrase is not cached, although the conversations are encrypted, it is still possible for anyone to read the names of the message recipients. This may be enough to incriminate an individual, and it certainly enables adversaries to easily discern the contact details of the individuals to whom I have been sending encrypted messages. I'd like to see TextSecure enable encryption for all details not only message content, assuming this is possible?

		Its not exactly a number one priority, but... When the &quot;Include whitespace tag&quot; is used it adds a white-space at the end of non-encrypted messages like it says it does. This is fine until your in an area with fluctuating signal, because when a message doesn't send it still adds the white-space and if you copy the message in one of two ways, it still has a white-space and duplicates it at the end of the message and can cause the message not to display correctly. The two ways in concern are... The click and hold on a message to copy it. The clicking on a message to put it in the message box. This is easily fixed by disabling the feature, but if the feature is there and can be fixed up to be better why not. Possible solution could be a resend button for when it fails or even a check for a white space before adding one.

		While TextSecure is running, it shows a notification to indicate that the passphrase is cached. There is no way to dismiss this notification while the key is cached... this is good. My feature request is that it should be possible to dismiss this notification, and have TextSecure automatically clear the passphrase when it is dismissed. This will make a much quicker way to clear the cached key, and take far fewer steps in order to do it.

		This has been happening randomly for me lately, I assume it's since the latest update. My passphrase is cached, and when I go to open TextSecure, it opens to the most recent conversation. Hitting the back key seems to just close and re-open the same conversation. The only way I seem to be able to open the conversation list is by killing the two TextSecure processes from the running apps list. Then when I restart, if I enter into a different conversation from the list, exiting that conversation by pressing the back key, brings me back to the most recent conversation again, not the conversation list. I think it might be worth noting also that deleting the conversation thread that persistently shows (most recent...usually...I think), doesn't solve the issue, a blank/new thread with the same contact is shown in place of the deleted one. If it helps, I've got a Sony Xperia S LT26i running Android 4.0.4 If there's any other information I can provide, just let me know here. Thanks! :)

		When I receive a new message, I will get a notification. If I click on the notification, I will go to that person within TextSecure. But if I do not click on the notification, and just go into TextSecure.....I do not know who sent me the new message. It would be nice to have the box around the user highlighted in green, or maybe have a green number in the box that represents new messages that have not been read. Thanks, Keep up the good work. Nice to have people looking out for you in this age of 1984.

		After creating a bulk message, the recipients are not easily listed anywhere. The contacts are listed, but after the first few it gets cut. you can check the details of each message sent but that's slow. Please make an option included in a bulk sms message with easily displays the currently included recipients. So I know who any future messages will be sent in bulk too. adding/removing people would be overkill.. but having a nice list would be awesome.

		Even though two parties having TextSecure have encrypted communication, carriers can still gleam and log much information about a conversation, such as who communicates, when and how often, and the length of texts. Also some folks have limited texting plans and this might save 'em a buck. Side note: I know like 2 years ago I was like nahh don't do it, but back then not everybody had data plans! I didn't have the vision! lol

		Using version 0.7.4 from Google Play. TextSecure instances of two communicating users seem to disagree on whether a secure session is established. How to reproduce: User A and User B do NOT have TextSecure installed. User A installs TextSecure. The &quot;automatically complete key exchanges&quot; option is ON. User A attempts to initiate a secure session with User B. User B installs TextSecure. The &quot;automatically complete key exchanges&quot; option is ON. User B attempts to initiate a secure session with User A. At this point, User A's device believes that the secure session IS established, but User B's device believes that the secure session IS NOT established. An encrypted message sent from A to B will show up on B's device as Message encrypted for non-existing session.... User A aborts the secure session with User B. User A attempts to initiate a secure session with User B again. At this point, User B's device believes that the secure session IS established, but User A's device believes that the secure session IS NOT established. An encrypted message sent from B to A will show up on A's device as Message encrypted for non-existing session.... User B aborts the secure session with User A. User B attempts to initiate a secure session with User A again. At this point the cycle repeats.

		Had an MMS (unencrypted) from someone, and every time I now receive a message (SMS or MMS) I get a &quot;new message&quot; notification (e.g. showing &quot;(2) new messages&quot; even though there is only one new one) -- this happens even though the message has been read and deleted. I've a hard time reproducing it. It's persistent through reboots, though.

		Hello there A feature I really liked about the Jellybean messaging app is that I could see when I actually should.have received the message. This because I turn off my phone lots of times. When I turn my phone on now and get my messages, they all have the same received time: that moment that I turned on my phone, not when the message has been sent. That's one of the most important features I'm missing. However, I also would like any confirmation option when my message arrives to the other part. Thanks

		While typing an SMS, sometimes, you get notifications and switch applications to act with the notification. And after returning to application, sometimes you have come back to home to check agenda or whatever, and the draft of the message has been lost. Since every SMS composer on android seems to handle that, it should be great that TextSecure handles it too.

		I updated this morning on my T-Mobile G2 with 2.3.4 and now when I send a text it is forever stuck at &quot;Sending...&quot; and keeps resending the message every few minutes. I haven't tried an mms yet since I had to disable textsecure. Here's what aLogcat gave me with a filter for &quot;thoughtcrime&quot;: W/PackageManager( 1296): Unknown permission android.permission.READ_PROFILE in package org.thoughtcrime.securesms W/PackageManager( 1296): Unknown permission android.permission.WRITE_PROFILE in package org.thoughtcrime.securesms W/PackageManager( 1296): Not granting permission android.permission.BROADCAST_WAP_PUSH to package org.thoughtcrime.securesms (protectionLevel=2 flags=0x8be44) W/PackageManager( 1296): Unknown permission android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG in package org.thoughtcrime.securesms I/ActivityManager( 1296): Starting: Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN cat=[android.intent.category.

		My friends have informed me that they've been spammed with texts from my phone. Evidently TextSecure has a bit of a history of occasionally resending SMS without user input so I'm frankly not surprised by this report. I wanted to file a bug report so it can be fixed. Let me know if you need any logs or diagnostic reports. Based on the changelog I think someone probably has a good idea what causes this problem.

		It would be a great feature to allow threads to automatically be pruned to a user specified length. Basically allow the user to set an option that when a thread exceeds X number of text messages, delete the oldest to keep the length at X. Also it would be great if I could protect messages so they are not automatically deleted. Thanks

		On my girlfriends Android she gets a NullPointerException on ECDHBasicAgreement.java:41 when she is trying to decrypt the messages. The crash only occurs if she gets the &quot;right&quot; password, otherwise it states &quot;wrong passphrase&quot;. We have sent in a crash report on this, but I am eager for a fix since she is at the moment unable to read SMS messeges she has already rescived.

		I checked my phone today and all my old messages in TextSecure are gone. I got a friend to send me a new message to check and indeed that is the only message that shows up now. What could have happened? What can I try to get them back? Should I try re-importing them from SD card? Using Samsung Galaxy S (GT-I9000) with firmware 2.3.6 build no GINGERBREAD.XWJW6 with app version 0.8.5 I think (at least Google Play tells me it is up to date)

When I attempt to take on on my Samsung Galaxy S3, it has an error &quot;Couldn't capture screenshot: Couldn't save screenshot. Storage may be in use&quot;. I am able to screenshot the native Messaging app and the home page and so on. This is using the Power+Home button combination.

		The telco did an OTA SIM card upgrade the other day (while TS was used for &quot;all SMS messages&quot;): The handset reported &quot;SIM card full&quot; (although there were no messages on the SIM card). This message persisted across handset reboots. After I changed TS to only handle encrypted messages, this message did not return after a reboot. Anyone else seen this? Tor

		In some cases Android devices (cheaper or older or made for other markets) don't support some less popular languages, but TextSecure has the translation. It would be nice to allow users to switch to their language within TextSecure even if their OS isn't supporting it. It could also provide a &quot;workaround&quot; for #128 :)

		When unlocking the TextSecure DB you are prompted for a password, if a user gets the password wrong the typed characters are left in place. This results in the user having to delete the password before retyping it, as it's too hard to figure out where the typo was in a starred out password. I would like to propose that if an incorrect password is typed the password field is blanked, thus saving users the trouble of deleting the incorrect pass.

		After having experienced the issue quite often, I've been looking at the code just now to make sure the behaviour hadn't changed since I had the issue. If I'm missing something, just close this :) So, if I'm not mistaken, when aborting a secure session, this happens : https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/crypto/KeyUtil.java#L79 Basically, keys are flushed, status is retored, and the thread goes on. So if Alice and Bob were having a secure exchange, and Alice aborts the secure session, she never notifies Bob of this. The result is that Bob still has the symmetric encrypton key in his memory, and more importantly, he will use them to communicate with Alice on the next message, even a month after Alice flushed the keys... This forces most users to keep the secure sessions ON all the time. Which means keys are not flushed ASAP as they probably should be. I think Textsecure should allow for an usable application of the best practice of ending secure sessions when an exchange has been completed. This could be fixed very easily by sending a &quot;I'm aborting the session&quot; notification accross the secure channel before clearing everything. This should probably not require an ACK of any sort, so it would be quite cheap, and then it's up to the other person to close its side of the session too (but Textsecure should recognize that the other side of the covnersation has already ended its secure session, so no notification should be sent when Bob closes its session too.) You could even automatically close the session upon receiving this notification. I'm tempted to say that we could also use this additionnal step to disclose authentication keys and get plausible deniability, but I'm not sure if it's possible to do this without screwing up the secure channel big time, so it's probably better to not do that ATM :) I know SMSes are not cheap for everyone, but making the other party of the conversation doesn't stay unsynced with the conversation state would probably be a great improvement... I'm tired of receiving messages encrypted with month-long-gone encryption keys, because they never see that I closed the session.

		After the most recent update, I noticed a change in behavior with the back button. Before, hitting the back button while in a conversation thread would always return me back to the message list view. Now, hitting back will often send me to other conversation threads, often times it will send me to the SAME conversation thread I just hit back on. I believe this happens when I view messages via the status bar notification. Example: I am talking to somebody in a conversation thread then hit home. The same person messages me again, and I select the message from the status bar to view it. Then I hit back - it will take me to the exact same conversation I was just on. Then I have to hit back again to get to the message list view. When talking to many people at once this gets quite annoying. The back button on a conversation should always return to the message list! Thank you guys for the fantastic software.

		Small (but annoying?) issue: It appears that the Telenor MMSC does not recognise that a delivered MMS (that is, an MMS that I receive) has been delivered. The way the user experiences this is an SMS from the operator (number 1999) with the (translated) message &quot;You have received an MMS from , bla bla&quot; (basically offering a secondary means of downloading the MMS via their web pages). Shall I try to capture some packets as I receive an MMS and post them to you? (Like last time: OS-app v TS dumps.) This is not a new issue; it's just that I thought we (you :-) could focus on the MMS send issue first..

		To repro: Send text to one contact from TextSecure, and to a different contact from system sms app, so that you have different names at the top of each app's thread lists. Export to SD. Uninstall. Reinstall. Import messages from system sms app. Import from SD. The first thread in TextSecure thread list now has the contact name from the first thread in the system sms app, though the thread itself is correct and shows the correct contact in its own view.

		I'm experiencing an issue where the last sent message continues to display as &quot;Sending...&quot; until you send another message. The message is actually delivered but the status doesn't change until you send another message. Which is a bit of a pain to know if your message was sent successfully when your in a location with questionable coverage. I did a search on the submitted issues and this appeared to be the same as previously submitted issue. However in that issue the sending status never changed at all. Also that issue was fixed a long time ago and released, this is a new issue I've been experiencing since the latest update. I'm running a Motorola Droid 4 with 4.1.2 Android OS.

		Verified and unverified sessions are indicated by different-colored check marks on the padlock icon - I'm not sure what colors they are since I'm color blind :) It's difficult for color blind users to tell which check mark indicates verified and which indicates unverified (and depending on the type of color deficiency, some users may have trouble telling them apart at all). I would suggest using both color and some differentiation in the symbol itself - e.g. a question mark could better indicate unverified state.

		This is with a GSM Samsung Galaxy S2, stock 4.1.2 rom. If I have &quot;mobile data&quot; disabled and someone sends me an MMS, textsecure will get and hold a wakelock seemingly forever (with textsecure dispaying &quot;Connecting to MMS server...&quot; on the message).

		On a Nexus One, running TextSecure (0.9.8) gets very slow when opening a conversation with 4,050 messages. It's now taking at least 6 to 10 seconds to display anything when accessing that conversation. The same delay occurs again after sending a message. Other conversations with fewer messages open quite quickly and don't experience delays after sending messages. Perhaps only the most recent messages in a conversation could be decrypted and displayed first, and the rest backfilled as time permits?

		I would like to add a feature which allows you to mark all messages as read, instead of individually opening conversations. In stock android this works by pressing menu-&gt;&quot;mark all read&quot;. It would be fine if this was implemented in a similar fashion. It's useful because some messages I read on Google Voice and I already know the contents. This would just make using the app easier and with fewer key presses.

This would be greatly appreciated.

		Use of this application IMMEDIATELY renders people's communications 'interesting' to any surveillance apparatus. This is a major drawback and should more prominently discussed for the security of the user base. Steganography and/or alternative delivery paths (ie. not via SMS, but perhaps with a stego-SMS as a push notify to pull from a drop location) could help to resolve this problem.

		In the spirit of https://ssd.eff.org/your-computer/protect/retention having deletion of messages older than a certain amount is probably good practice. I previously used an automated tool to delete SMS messages older than 30 days, but since TextSecure uses its own database, this no longer works. Having the option for TextSecure to delete messages older than X (reuse of the passphrase timeout selector would be fine) would be highly helpful.

		One of my Chinese contacts sent me an SMS. TextSecure doesn't appear to encode chinese characters, I can only see some binary mess. Before, I imported existing SMS's from this contact, they imported ok. Those I can decipher. My guess is that the original Message App encodes the writing well, and those were copied straight into TextSecure.

		I received a text message while TextSecure was being updated. After the update finished I opened the application and in place of the arrived message there was a grey text &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot;. This did not seem to ever finish. After forgetting the passphrase and entering it again the message was decrypted, so it wasn't lost.

		Not much to say; multi-part messages are sorted in the order they were received rather than the order they were sent. If the 2nd in a series of 3 arrives last, you will see Part 1 - Part 3 - Part 2.

		Looks like you are using 100 rounds of PKCS#5 - PBKDF2 here: private static SecretKey getKeyFromPassphrase(String passphrase, byte[] salt) { PBEKeySpec keyspec = new PBEKeySpec(passphrase.toCharArray(), salt, 100); SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;PBEWITHSHA1AND128BITAES-CBC-BC&quot;); return skf.generateSecret(keyspec); } Shouldn't this be at least 10,000? At least for devices released in the last few years?

		It would be great if TS could integrate with Androids native system password and encrypt with the screen lock pin or password so that it would not have to be entered again when launching TS. Alternatively, for those of us whose devices are already encrypted and only need TS for over the air encryption, an option to forego local encryption all together would be nice.

		Is it possible to implement a solution to export encrypted TextSecure database in a form that could be (securely) opened/read outside the app? When I receive SMSes I imediately delete unimportant but keep the others. Slowly the amount of kept ones is getting higher and higher. I don't need most of them for every day usage, i don't even need them on my device, but some of them are important to me and want to be able to read them when needed. I have an app on my device that backs them up from default SMS client to xml database and automagicaly transfers it to my dropbox so I can read old SMSes on my computer whenever I want. The only problem in this scenario is that I don't like my personal stuff laying around unencrypted on clouds that belong to some corporation (I can encrypt personal or confidential emails on gmail with PGP if I want). So, could anything similar to above solution be done with TextSecure database, only in an encrypted form (maybe PGP encrypted) in a way as simple as possible? It's not really nice experience to browse hundreds of old SMSes on a mobile phone.

		I have been receiving text messages occasionally in the default app, rather than then being (as they have been until now) all processed by TextSecure. Assuming the recent update might have something to do with this. Using a Nexus 4 with Android 4.2.2

		Not sure if this is my case but since I've installed the app I've noticed that whenever I get text from a sender that does not use numbers, the sender name gets mixed with others. I'm not sure how to reproduce this. Thanks

		Basically I cant login the app anymore even though I'm positive I'm using the correct password. It keeps saying that the password is invalid over and over. I'm using same password to unlock my phone, could this be the issue? Again not sure how to reproduce this. Thanks Edit: forgot to mention that I'm using SGS3

		From the Google Play Description: &quot;★ Use the default system dialer and contacts apps to make calls as you normally would. ★ RedPhone will give you the opportunity to upgrade to encrypted calls whenever the person you're calling also has RedPhone installed.&quot; I've installed RedPhone and registered on both mine and my wife's phone. I have found no way to make encrypted calls from the system dialer/contact app, nor to upgrade a call in progress to an encrypted call. Is this not yet developed in the Beta or is the description incorrect? Both phones are Verizon Samsung Galaxy S4 with Android 4.2.2

		Currently, if you receive a message from an unknown phone number there's no good way to associate it with an entry in the phone's address book. Even when viewing SMS details, users cannot copy and paste the number, so they end up having to add it manually. It would be nice if there was a feature similar to &quot;Add to contacts&quot; that exists in the default messaging app. Until then, I found a workaround that's not intuitive, but gets the job done: Press the call button so that it opens the number in the Phone app From there, press the physical Menu button and select &quot;Add to contacts&quot;

		I'm using a Samsung S3 (Verizon) and when I try to attach a picture and send it, it seems to go through the motions. THen I get an error message &quot;Error sending message&quot; with a padlock and a red warning notice. Kinda frustrating, but i'm not sure if its an operator error or just a bug. Any suggestions on how to resolve this would be appreciated. ** Just an update. I tried this again. Not sure what changed, but it shows connecting to MMS server. Sat there a little while, I noticed it flash decrypting.. and then got the unsupported Encoding error.. Happened twice, so i'm gonna guess its a software issue. Again, any suggestions to get this going would be great.

		I had an issue with the passphrase, maybe I made an error putting it in initially but unlikely. however since I could not log in, I uninstalled the app, and tried to re-install. But now it will not let me install. When I click instal it goes to the next screen but only offers, to install on another device. Does not allow me to install on my Kyocera Rise. Any Idea how I can fix ?

		Sending to multiple recipients (some using TextSecure, some not) is not working. When viewing details of the failed message, TextSecure shows it as a MMS. When I use the regular Andriod Messaging app, I have similar problems until I configure Messaging to not use MMS for multiple recipients. There's no such config option in TextSecure.

Currently it is not present in TextSecure due to which it becomes very difficult to send contact info of one person to another.

		I know this is a bit above and beyond the typical SMS functionality, and I totally understand if this gets dropped to the bottom of the list, but I do find I often need to find out about some SMSs far more urgently than others -- in my case, I have a critical server that tells me when it's down: I'd like that one to scream loudly at me even if I'm sleeping deeply. Some unknown number texting me about a dream vacation that I have won I am quite happy to sleep thru. :) Awesome work regardless, team! R

		This seems different to me than what is being reported in Issue #105 as I am receiving the Google authentication messages, but some of them do not work. In particular, this morning, I went to use Google Hangouts and received a prompt from the app to verify my phone number. I clicked the option to verify and received an SMS from Google stating &quot;Your Google verification code is _NCCiEA5qvy&quot;. I assume this is supposed to be some sort of hyperlinked URL that I am supposed to click on, yet TextSecure is only showing it to me as text so I am unable to click on it in order to verify my number with Google.

		When I select add an attachment after opening a thread, textsecure prompts me to enter my APN settings. I've already filled the fields.Selecting okay tells me I can change the settings at any time then brings me back to my message. Selecting cancel just brings me back to the message. Selecting add attachment looks the cycle. This happens with both secure and insecure sessions. My Carrier Is Bell Mobility (Canada) and I've posted a logcat to http://pastebin.com/PjV0Bhu3

		SGH-T889 Android Version 4.1.2 TextSecure v 0.9.9.6 Installed app via Google Play store. First attempt to send a secure message with an associate failed - attempted to start secure session, sent key exchange request, had no reply. Plaintext passes ok, then I received cyphertext. Stopped/restarted app, cleared messages, both sides unable to complete key request.

		My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. &quot;If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point&quot;. This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

			<description>
		I tried doing some quick research of how TextSecure is doing authentication. At the moment my impression that it's not but just assumes there are no MITM and stores the keys for verification at a later point. I guess this a very convenient and reasonable default. However, it would be nice if I could &quot;strongly authenticate&quot; my contacts which would indicate I have verified the keys in person and trust them. This could (should IMO) also be rewarded by adding some visual indicator in the UI. (maybe a better solution is to reverse the process and show an indicator it a contact is not authenticated).

		....if and only if android storage encryption is enabled. I have encrypted my phone storage using the built in phone storage encryption (dm-crypt). I would see it as a nice addition to be able to disable the built in app encryption, thus avoiding being asked for a passphrase, if phone storage encryption is active. I also find the &quot;cached passphrase&quot; a bit annoying which could be omitted in this case. Unless you see any issues with this approach I may find some time to help implementing it in the future. More information https://source.android.com/tech/security/ http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html https://source.android.com/tech/encryption/android_crypto_implementation.html Potential problems I'm not familiar with the device administration API but it may be necessary to require the BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN permission. But I don't think so I'm not sure how android/dm-crypt manages the keys when the phone is on, but locked

		I noticed that when sending a group message, textsecure opens up my 3g connection (instead of wifi) and tries to send it as an MMS. Why? It usually fails because MMS has always been flaky on my phone. Besides which, I'm trying to send text not mms (usually unencrypted to people who don't have textsecure). After digging though the issues on here I found out about the stealthy &quot;go straight or right turn&quot; broadcast/conversation switch, which sounds like it will do what I want, but i thought I'd still log it anyway.

		I am not sure if this is due to my operator or the TextSecure application but I thought I'd mention it here either way. Every time I receive a MMS I get another copy of the exact same MMS four days later. This happens from different people with different phones, so it seems unlikley that the issue is on their side. My spontaneous though was that maybe TextSecure doesn't mark the MMS as read properly on the server and thus I get another version of it. I am using vanilla Android 4.2.1 on a Galaxy Nexus phone. I just upgraded to the latest version, so I have been using version 0.9.9.6 of TextSecure.

		I use a Samsung Ace, which has very little internal memory and Android 2.3.6. But it tells me, i still have 23 MB left. Everytime I try to update to a new TextSecure version, it fails because of too little memory, but it can update other apps. Uninstall and Reinstall works, but then I loose my chat history. Do you have any idea, why this is happening and what to do?

		EDIT: This issue is not a bug in TextSecure, but appears to be a Cyanogenmod problem. MMS does work with a correctly spelled Fallback MMSC. Please close this one. Sorry. _ORIGINAL MESSAGE FOLLOWS_ Since switching to an AOSP-based ROM (CM 10.1), trying to &quot;Add Attachment&quot; to a message brings up a screen that explains that APN data is not available, and requesting MMSC information. However, even after filling in the correct URL, sending MMS fails every time. Logcat includes: E/DatabaseUtils( 1698): java.lang.SecurityException: No permission to write APN settings: Neither user 10069 nor current process has android.permission.WRITE_APN_SETTINGS. I don't know why this wasn't a problem on my previous TouchWiz ROM.

		Hello textsecure team, since two updates of textsecure I can't verify recievers any more. There is no red/green checkmark any more (upper bar). If there is a TextSecure reciever on the other side, the lock on the upper bar is locked, but it just offers the possibility to verify the sender or drop the the session. If I try to verify the reciever, I get to the key screen, but there is no option anymore to do this. I just see a green lock on the sending button - but for all textsecure sessions. Same behavior if the session is/was still verified/marked as verified. I thought this might be a bug. I already tried to export my TextSecure-Data, remove the app, install again, and import my backed up data. Still the same issue I'm using Android 4.1.2 on XT890 with TextSecure in the latest version.# thanx in advance

		I upgraded from Android 2.1 to CyanogenMod 10.1. I had a recent version of TextSecure (from June or July 2013) on the old system and exported an encrypted backup. I installed TextSecure on the new OS. After importing the backup every text is displayed as &quot;Error decrypting message.&quot; The meta-data is correct but importing does not overwrite the password which I set while installing TextSecure.

		Greetings, Just to be short and sweet, whenever I attach a photo to my messages, it distorts the image. This happens with a portrait or landscape shot. I reliably see this on my G2X running Gingerbread, and on my new HTC One with Jelly Bean. I haven't tested sending video too much, but when I receive video it seems like a compressed low quality version. When I use the stock messaging apps on both phones, images send clear and undistorted. I can receive photo attachments just fine though. Thanks! .:Tory

		open TextSecure to the 'main' page where the list of people and their most recent message is displayed tap and hold one person to get the &quot;Batch Selection Mode&quot; notification tap the checkmark to the left of the &quot;Batch Selection Mode&quot; notification to disable batch mode. Alternatively, tap the Android Back Arrow to do the same thing tap the first person in the list Expect: the list of messages for that person will be displayed Actual: the person highlights, but nothing happens The workaround seems to be to move the focus from TextSecure to another app and then come back. At this point, tapping the person works as expected.

		Just like the title says. When there is a USB plugged into the phone (on connection event), erase the Text Secure credentials from memory and require the user to enter their password. This is to make it harder for some one to gain access to the encrypted text message database since upon connection (via USB at least) the saved credentials are destroyed in memory and can not be gleaned from a memory dump.

		Dear developers, as we all care about privacy I would recommend to publish TextSecure on F-Droid (with having updates) as some people don't use Google Market. edit: The discussion on F-Droid can be read here: https://f-droid.org/forums/topic/textsecure/ edit: I understand the discussion, thanks for your replies.

		I received a text from a non-Textsecure user - all my replies to him indicate a green checkmark over what looks like a grey folder or box after my reply text to him. What does this indicate? I'm concerned he's not receiving my text created in textsecure to a non-textsecure user -or- he's receiving garbled text. Thank you. Newbie - I've only had it for a few days. Searched all over the site and cannot find what this green checkmark means.

		@moxie0 @epowell @liftthis @joshlf13 @WhisperSystems It seems that perhaps the new Google Cloud Messaging will allow TextSecure to work with Google Voice now? https://developers.google.com/android/c2dm/ &quot;C2DM has been officially deprecated as of June 26, 2012...Existing C2DM developers are encouraged to migrate to the new version of C2DM, called Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM). See the C2DM-to-GCM Migration document for more information. Developers must use GCM for new development.&quot; http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/c2dm.html

		Hi, I have a new nexus 4 phone and I planned to import all my messages from TextSecure from my old phone to this one. I exported everything from the old phone and then copied it to a local directory in my nexus 4. However when I try to import, it throws an error saying there is no SD card available in the phone. This is correct as nexus4 doesnt have a SD Card slot. But now how do I import all the data from the correct local directory?

		While initiating a text message conversation with someone with a U.S. number, whom I don't have listed in my address book, instead of that person's number coming up in the top of the screen, another person who I do have in my address book appears (meaning their name and address book picture). This other person is a contact in a different country, who happens to share the exact last same 8 digits as the person whom I sent a text message to in the United States. Obviously their country code differs, as well as the first two digits after the country code.

		Hi, I have recently tried to establish a secure session with a friend, but we both had the problem that TextSecure didn't stop sending new key exchange requests which were verified by the TextSecure instance on the other side correctly. And paying for messages that are sent automaticly every 2 minutes is not funny... ;) I might have found the problem in the code, but I'm not sure, so please take a look at the following classes and code fragments: KeyExchangeProcessor: the method 'public boolean processKeyExchangeMessage(KeyExchangeMessage message, long threadId)' is initially called by the SmsReceiver, if the received key exchange message is from a valid sender (else if (processor.isTrusted(keyExchangeMessage))) this method will send a new OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage, if 'needsResponseFromUs()' evaluates to true. private boolean needsResponseFromUs() { return !hasInitiatedSession() || remoteKeyRecord.getCurrentRemoteKey() != null; } The remoteKey is set afterwards: remoteKeyRecord.setCurrentRemoteKey(message.getPublicKey()); After that the IdentityKey of the message is set in the database for this recipient: if (message.hasIdentityKey()) {
  DatabaseFactory.getIdentityDatabase(context)
                 .saveIdentity(masterSecret, recipient, message.getIdentityKey());
}
 and the initially received KeyExchangeMessage is scheduled for decrypt: DecryptingQueue.scheduleRogueMessages(context, masterSecret, recipient); Please take a look to the DecryptingQueue.java file: The scheduled decrypt for the KeyExchangeMessage should finally land in the method 'handleKeyExchangeProcessing(String plaintxtBody)' Here the method processKeyExchangeMessage is called again, if the message has a valid IdentityKey: else if (processor.isTrusted(keyExchangeMessage)) { DatabaseFactory.getEncryptingSmsDatabase(context).markAsProcessedKeyExchange(messageId); processor.processKeyExchangeMessage(keyExchangeMessage, threadId); } Since the remoteKey is set, another OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage will be sent and the message will be scheduled again... So we have a constellation where the OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage is sent endlessly. But I'm not sure, if it's possible to get into this loop, but my experience suggests it is... The AUTO_KEY_EXCHANGE_PREF must be set to true in the preferences. I hope this description is helpful. Best regards Axel

		Hello, As you have probably heard, a major security flaw in the default SecureRandom implementation on Android has been reported yesterday[1]. This has left many BitCoin wallets vulnerable, but sounds like it will effect other cryptographic apps that use SecureRandom as well. If I have seen correctly, TextSecure also uses the java SecureRandom class and the ECDSA signature, so I am wondering, is TextSecure also vulnerable to this security flaw? If yes, what exactly would be effected? [1] http://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-08-11-android

Also, you could include a &quot;stealth&quot; notification mode where for instance, only a led would blink. Hide the sender is the priority though.

		Deleting individual messages from a conversation is cumbersome and inefficient (Hold down on a message, then select Delete from popup menu, then select Yes on confirmation message, one message at a time). By way of contrast, holding down on a conversation in the Conversations list initiates Batch Selection Mode, allowing user to select multiple conversations for an action (currently Delete is the only option). Being able to trim out fluff from a conversation but keep important messages would be a valuable feature. A similar Batch Selection Mode for individual messages within a conversation (as already exists in the default Android Text Message app) would provide this functionality.

		I'm running Cyanogenmod 10.1.2 ROM (Android 4.2.2), with stock kernel on a Samsung Epic 4G. I took a picture with the camera application (held camera in portrait orientation), then cropped the picture and saved it. I started TextSecure and attached the picture to send MMS message. When attached, the picture appeared stretched side-to-side and looked incorrect as an attachment. When my wife received the picture, she said that it looked incorrect also. I resent the same photo through the stock messaging application, and the cropped photo was attached and sent without the side-to-side stretch distortion.

		When receiving or sending an MMS with a photo, the photo is resized, but the aspect ratio is not maintained. Therefore, photos look stretched inside the TextSecure message window. However, there is not problem with viewing the photo after saving the photo to storage outside of TextSecure.

		When I'm pushing TextSecure onto friends and family to spread adoption of encrypted communications, the showstopper is the lack of an unread messages count on the icon, like all other messaging apps have today. When I send text messages to my mother, she will never read them, because when she turns her phone on, TextSecure won't show on her home screen as &quot;1 unread message&quot; with a little red circled &quot;1&quot; on the TextSecure icon. Drawing from UX from all other messaging apps today, the lack of such a number will instead indicate &quot;nothing unread&quot;. I understand such an indicator is a privacy leak, but it's also an adoption showstopper to take TextSecure beyond the hardcore carers for cryptography, and by extension, even the ability for people like ourselves to communicate securely with friends and family (since they won't use TextSecure). Cheers, Rick

		I want to be able to make TextSecure the default handler for only encrypted texts sent from other TextSMS users. Reason #1 -- I like being able to automagically have my regular SMS messages backed up to teh Googlez. It seems like this could be resolved by giving SecureText an option to use the regular SMS database for unencrypted texts.. Reason #2 -- It's just not as glitzy and polished as the SMS app I usually use. If I could talk to the couple paranoid people in my life with this app and everyone else with my regular SMS app, that would great!

		When selecting images taken from the camera to send, the images are stretched. I know images are shrunk for space limitations, but the aspect ratio changes. This doesn't happen when a non TextSecure user sends me images, only when I send. No one I know is yet using TextSecure, so I can't test with send/receive through it.

		Hello, TextSecure is an amazing app but it's only available on the Play Store (except if you compile the source, but not everyone know how to do this). It would be very nice if TextSecure can be available on the Fdroid repository. At least can you put an .apk on github so everyone can download it without use a Google service ? Have a nice day. KaitoKito. Edit : I think the same about the redphone app but I don't think it's necessary to create a new issue on the redphone project to copy-paste this message...

		Hey, on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with Jelly Beans, some messages (like 10-20%) are not received by TextSecure but by the normal message-Android-app. Those messages won't show up in TextSecure at all. TextSecure is running in the background and this happens if the encryption key is stored in the ram or not. Did someone else experience that? Cheers, Kim

		(Disclaimer: I'm not a designer.) It would be nice if the launcher icon could be updated to reflect the current Android design guidelines (see the rightmost of the three columns: Iconography | Android Developers). I imagine the green box should be a bit more three-dimensional. As an example, the BBC News, Flipboard, Nova Launcher Prime, and Google Calendar app icons are all slightly three-dimensional. Currently the icon looks out of place on Android 4+ launchers.

		have textsecure set to solely control incoming sms messages. native text messaging on android 4.0.4 still receives messages. getting two alerts and two iterations of every text message. setting for textsecure to solely control received sms messages not working.

		I had this thought. Right now even if you stored some key information for each user you text. There is still an initial man in the middle attack. Not a big fan of the NSA/IRS right now I would like to be confident that I am having a private conversation. It would be nice if we could use some out of band way to initialize the shared key stuffs. For example if we called each other, read numbers to each other, typed in the corresponding number it would be hard for someone to insert themselves in between. Another way might be to have the cellphones present each other some sort of 2d bar code that they scan.

		Device A is running Android 4.3. (Cyanogenmod current.) SMS is being sent/received via google voice through @koush's Voice+. Device B is running Android 4.0.4/Sense 3.6. (Can't be upgraded.) Device B can send a key exchange message to Device A. It is received and processed. Device A then sends an encrypted message to Device B, but that is received as ciphertext, and not decrypted. I then cancel the secure session and send a key exchange message from Device A to Device B. The message is received as ciphertext and not decrypted and processed. So it appears that Device B running Android 4.0.4 cannot process any ciphertext, but can send a session initiation request, and then fails to handle the response. That or Device A either isn't responding properly with the response to the session initiation request, and/or isn't sending session initiation requests properly. Any idea on how I can send some debug logs for this that might help figure this out?

		I use a password safe for all my passwords. I used the same password safe for text secure. It works pretty good, I unlock the safe, select the entry. Copy the password and paste it where I needed it. I created a new entry for TextSecure. Nice strong random string of good encryption. I pasted the password into TextSecure for the initial install. Now I flushed the in memory keys used by textsecure. When I open the application it asks me for my password. I do the same steps as before. I copy and paste the password into the field from the password safe. However textsecure does not take the password. I am guessing when I created the original password it clipped the password to a length it deemed appropriate. Unfortunately that clipped password is not my password, and now my password does not work. TextSecure should have errored out instead of using a different password. What is the character limit on textsecure? Does it clip from the front or back?

			<description>
		For some time now, I have been recieving seemingly random text messages from TextSecure. The text of those messages have been similar to this: sisp:LDEn0NAoHCrvI0UqFKpkhA==:1:1https://mobselfcare.optusnet.com.au/;4444;61404075361;XUYOOdazySUSX52i9hltFT3RQ4xOKUpf I have been in contact with my service provider (Optus), who assure me that they are not generating this message and suggested that the program is doing it. When I received a message like this only when my phone powered on, I could live with this behaviour, but recently it has started recieving these messages on a roughly hourly basis, which is annoying to say the least. using the latest version through Google Play on Android 2.3.5 on a HTC Happy to be told this is not a bug, but include something about how I can switch it off - the last time this happened, I almost uninstalled the program, it was so annoying

		I'm working to add functionality to TextSecure to allow customization of notifications (ringtone, vibrate pattern, led color) on a per-contact basis. I've got two questions: Is this a feature that you'd be interested in including in mainline TextSecure, and If so, would it be better to let android store the per-contact preferences in the usual preferences location or would it be better to add them to the IdentityDatabase? Thanks!

		Hi. TextSecure seems to be using something other than OTR. Rather than straight SMS, I use a jabber-to-SMS gateway, and I was hoping that the OTR on my jabber client would be compatible with TextSecure. That is not the case. Should I work on some sort of OTR compatibility mode for textsecure? Any words of guidance on this?

		Allow for the extra header that google voice attaches text messages and still allow decryption. currently a msg received is recognized as a text secure msg but the return key and further msgs are wont work as google uses a token text msg phone number and puts the real txt caller id in the msg as a header. text msgs to the reciever with the extra header are still encrypted

		In previous versions it was possible to send a message to multiple people using plain SMS. As outlined in #347 TextSecure can nowadays send groupmessages only as MMS. It would be still good to be able to send a message to multiple people using only SMS. Not everybody (as a sender or receiver) has MMS setup or knows how MMS should be setup, so TextSecure makes it now very hard to use it as the default app for all kind of messages, if group messaging is not possible without any fiddling in the settings. -&gt; Without being able to send Groupmessages as SMS TextSecure is less likely being adopted, as it is not a straight drop-in replacement for the default messenger. Although, I believe you that implementing real group messaging in MMS is technical less a problem it should in my opinion still possible to send a simple SMS (like an invitiation) to multiple recipients using plain old SMS.

		Hello, I'm having an issue while attempting to send an MMS with an attachment (a picture from the camera). Text only SMS works great. It's possible to send pictures with the stock MMS application, it only fails with Text Secure. aLogcat file: http://pastebin.com/DUJ7gNXs A screenshot of the error: http://i.imgur.com/oDokv4a.jpg Thank you for this application which worked great with my previous phone, and please forgive my bad english.

		Hi All, Using text secure have found a bug when sending or receiving text have to put pass word in no problem after reading my text or sending text there is no log out. The phone just goes back to normal mode 5 hours later clicked on the Secure text Icon and did not need to log in again shows up every text with out logging is a Security risk. I don't knows does any one else have this problem with there own mobile phone. I think a log out button would be a good thing or log out timer that switches you out when you have not used Secure text for some time. Apart form the bug the program is excellent. Regards Anthony

		Each time my passphrase times out and I re-enter it, the same MMS message is downloaded again - it appears as though it is being re-sent. I am running Cyanogenmod 10.1, TextSecure 1.0; my carrier is Bell Canada; phone is an HTC wildfire S. In preferences, both &quot;use for all SMS&quot; and &quot;use for all MMS&quot; are enabled. Deleting the entire thread appears to have fixed the problem for now. I did not try first deleting only the first instance of the MMS message, so i don't know if that would have been sufficient.

		Ambiguous title, I understand. Consider the following situation: I'm on a train that goes both overground and underground, and it has to go through a long-winded tunnel for about 15 minutes. I send a message to X at 15:00. However, I'm in the tunnel and I have no signal, so the application returns an error as it's unable to send it. I leave the tunnel at 15:15, and the message is delivered. However, next to the message TextSecure writes 15:00, when the message was sent at 15:15. TextSecure should track when the message is actually delivered to the provider (&quot;leaves your phone&quot;) and not when you first hit the send button..

		Before the recent update, sending an SMS to multiple recipients correctly queued an SMS to each recipient independently. Now it converts it to an MMS group conversation, which is not the desired behaviour, for me. Is it possible for this to be a configurable option? Separately, this MMS conversation required me to look up the settings and re-enter them into Text Secure. I would be more than happy to grant access for Text Secure to read my device's MMS settings, were I prompted to do so. I'm using a Nexus 4, running Android 4.3, build JWR66Y. Text Secure doesn't have an About page with a version number (which would be useful) but the Play Store (in en-GB) shows the date 21 Oct 2013 for the app, with the description talking about Changes in 1.0.2

		Hello As soon as I upgraded to 1.0.2 my texting buddy got a &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; for my SMS to him. As soon as we re-keyed (&quot;Abort Secure Session&quot; and then &quot;Start Secure Session&quot; all was well. Sorry I can't offer a detailed log output but I didn't have physical access to my buddy's phone at the time. How may I record useful information if this happens in the future?

		The sms senders are sometimes displayed wrong. That is, I know the sender of a message but that message is grouped with some one else's message Here is an example, the top line says that the SMS is from ISBANK (this is not a contact I have in my contact list, but its the name of my bank), but the message is from google's calendar application reminding me of an appointment.. Another message's header says that the SMS was from IS BANKASI (again my bank) but the message is actually a service message I received when I changed GSM providers informing me of that the settings have been sent to my phone.

		For convenience I would like to omit providing a passphrase. As I encrypt the whole device through the function provided by Android, I don't have to worry about someone reading my messages when the device is stolen. At least not more than I already have to as I always cache the passphrase. Now, there are two issues: The application tells me, that I must use a passphrase :-( Is the passphrase used to encrypt the messages? I.e. would a short passphrase compromise the security of transmitted messages? Thank you in advance!

		there's always the same problem when i suggest TextSecure to a nongeeky person: people say &quot;whooo, yes!&quot;, install application, open it, and then - when a prompt for setting the password appears - shut it down and uninstall. they're even too lazy to first set the password and later set storage encryption to off. now, i understand the meaning of storage encryption for people that are living under opressive regimes or journalists, but for a usual non-techy european that only wants it's privacy it's a bit too much. so, it would be great if people could accept storage encryption (and set password) or skip it at the very beginning at the first use of the application.

		Basically, remove the password to your database, make an &quot;encrypted export&quot;, import that export. You will have a password prompt that you cannot get past unless you force kill text secure, then the next time you start it the password prompt will not be there. I suspect there are a few solutions. The easiest is to disallow encrypted export of unencrypted data. An alternative is to prompt the user for a password when exporting unencrypted data (or maybe always?) Oh and of course the password prompt bug for unencrypted databases could go away :)

		The lock icon will always show up in the left upper-hand corner of the task bar. Threema had the same thing and it get's crowded with a few apps and there is now way to get rid of the icon when the app is running. Threema solved this by lowering the priority of the task bar item. This way there is now small icon in the upper left corner, but when the notification bar is pulled down the Threema entry is still there. I think this would be a good behaviour for TextSecure. Appear in the notification bar when pulled down, but don't stick in the upper left corner.

		Unfortunately, Hangout is now the default SMS app on Android 4.4 so I decided to install TextSecure as my alternative SMS client. However, Android doesn't recognize that TextSecure could be an alternative SMS app and I can't tell the system that it should use TextSecure instead of Hangout. As a result an income SMS is picked up by both TextSecure and Hangout and notifications of both are played.

		I picked up my phone and noticed that my entire message history has disappeared! I've rebooted the phone twice with no effect. I have a Samsung Stratosphere running Android 2.3.6, TextSecure 1.0.2 and the 'Delete Old Messages' setting is NOT active. I recently changed my MMS preferences to enable Manual MMS. My carrier is Verizon. Is it possible the carrier has message storage limits I'm unaware of? I have no backups to export. Please advise.

		Hello, I have a problem with TextSecure. I want to export my messages to the SD Card in order to have a backup of my data. I want to export the messages in plaintext, but unfortunately I have no idea where to find it on the SD-Card or how to open it. I could’t find any plaintext data in /storage/sdcard0/TextSecure Export. I hope you can help me with this problem. Greetings,

		I know Tasker integration has been brought up before in WhisperSystems#96 but not since, and I've been thinking of it more and was thinking of how it could be implemented from within TextSecure. Baring in mind Tasker has no access to TextSecures database so can not be responsible for checking for new messages. Realistically TextSecure would have to notify Tasker of a new message. Could TextSecure be used to send a Broadcast Intent when a new message is received? Then Tasker would only have to listen for them. You could also setup extra variables for senders name or message, configurable from with-in TextSecure so the user could decided how much or how little information is then available to the system. My specific use case at present is Tasker speaks the sender name of a message to me and while I'm driving it reads out the message aloud so having the extra variables set would be helpful. I don't think my Java programming it up to doing this alone, but I have cloned the TextSecure repository and will give it a try, but what does anyone else think? 👍 1

		i noticed that when TextSecure is down and i receive an SMS, it doesn't &quot;start&quot; TextSecure and both application are thus desynchronised as upon a start of TextSecure, it does not synchronize its database with the SMS manager. The import of SMS warn that it import the whole database and may result in duplication. Some Ideas regarding this issue: never let TextSecure being stopped (like a daemon or automatically triggered upon reception of an SMS) synchronize its SMS database each time it is started so that every &quot;missed&quot; SMS is encrypted. An option to delete sms from SMS manager should also exist so that only encrypted SMS are left on the phone. I may try to code something for idea number 2.

		Not sure if this is a TextSecure issue. When in my cynagenmod OS, I get an SMS and since my TextSecure is unlocked, it shows the SMS to me in the notification list. There is an option to mark it as read. However when i mark it as read, nothing happens. Even after I remove it from my notification list by sliding the message to my right, the next time any SMS comes, it shows the old message also as unread.

I was using another app (not Text Secure) when the phone went dark then after several seconds the phone booted but many of my user preferences were lost (desktop was reset to the factory default, etc.) However my apps were all still installed and I was able to start Text Secure, enter my passphrase, and access the message threads, however the following happened: message thread contact profile photos were replaced with the generic gray &quot;human silhouette&quot; image threads contact names are now either &quot;anonymous&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; (my encrypted threads are anonymous, the other unencrypted threads are either anonymous or unknown) within an existing thread I can send a message to the correct recipient, but the message is not encrypted (the lock icon at the top is shown closed though as if the encrypted session is ongoing). What still works: passphrase I can view the messages in both encrypted and unencrypted threads. when opening threads (encrypted or not) the profile photo of the sender is shown next to each message clicking the profile photo next to any message (encrypted or not) I get the contact information for the sender. I can end the previous encrypted session (see bullet 3 above however) and initiate a new encrypted session through the normal key exchange. So it appears the the information for each message was maintained, however the information for the thread (including the key for encrypted sessions) was lost. I'm not certain there is really a Text Secure bug here since I don't believe it caused the system crash but maybe the data regarding message threads could be maintained in an improved way so that it isn't lost to a crash like this.

		When I first installed the app, I had issues with messages going to the stock messaging app despite TextSecure being set as default. That issue stopped when I disabled the stock messaging app. Now with the KitKat update, messages are going to Hangouts instead of TextSecure. I really don't want to have to disable Hangouts because I use hangouts. I see in the play store, this is a known issue. Has anyone come up with a workaround for it yet?

		It would appear that there is currently no way to delete a contact's key. If a contact decides to stop using TextSecure, it is impossible to send them unencrypted messages as long as TS has a key in its database that matches their number.

		I have Nexus 4 with Android 4.4 and tried to send a picture (with attachment, MMS). I have correct MMS settings (I also successfully received one normal, unencrypted MMS), but when I try to send a picture, TextSecure crashes. What exactly I did. I attached a picture (inside encrypted conversation (thread) with someone clicked Add attachment, added picture and no text). When I click to send, TextSecure crashes. I have to run it again, enter the passphrase to unlock it, and when I just click to a conversation thread containing that picture (which was not sent, i.e. the other party did not received it), TextSecure crashed again. I had to delete the complete conversation thread without opening it, to stop crashing... TextSecure version is 1.0.2.

		Silent SMS's are usually used for locating GSM user (when user receives SMS, location data are stored in data retention database) identifying his IMSI/TMSI number, etc. More about it here: http://matej.owca.info/predavanja/GSM_security_2012.pdf, page 39. Silent SMS are usually used together with IMSI catchers, more info here: http://secupwn.github.io/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/ The problem is, that silent SMS are - well, silent. User cannot see whether he or she has got that kind of SMS. It would be great if TextSecure would have an option to detect silent SMS'es and show them. BTW, silent SMS'es could be detected with Osmocom paltform. There is an application for Osmocom called Catcher catcher, which also detects silent SMS's, more info here: https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/catcher/wiki However, Osmocom is highly &quot;hacking&quot; platform, it is not usable for everyday use. Does this idea sounds interesting?

		There are several issues after updating to the newest android - the 4.4. 1 - The software is not identified by the system. What I mean by that? From people list, when pressing the &quot;create message&quot; automatically is chosen the default Messaging and do not provide me with the possibility to choose the Text Secure as in android 4.3. As it was never installed. 2 - When I receive sms messages they are delivered both to the Text Secure and Messaging - the default one. Hence, I get too double notifications - which is annoying. Can be solve these issues?

		When someone sends me a unencrypted text message, using the latest version of textsecure it doesn't load it. However, changing the default sms app to hangouts/messaging/anything else and then receiving a plain text message works.

		I dont personally use Google Play myself, but I would still like to use this application. It seems that TextSecure is only avaible va Google Play. I use only F-Droid myself. It is repository for Android that contains only free and open source software. https://f-droid.org/ So could you upload TextSecure to F-Droid? Or can I download .apk from somewhere else than Google Play?

		Trying to open a group message sent to mulitple recipients, no pictures attached. TextSecure crashes and goes back to home screen.

		I'd like an option to store messages in the normal texting database. Possibly display some sort of indication that messages are being stored in an unecrypted form in the normal database. The reason for this request is that the MMS messages don't seem to be fully ironed out and I seem to miss some.

		Since MMS doesn't work very well for me, I use Verizon Messages to receive MMS, and Textsecure for SMS. However in version 1.0.6 in KitKat I can't disable MMS in Textsecure like I used to be able to. If I uncheck &quot;Enable Manual MMS&quot;, one of two things will happen: Seems to work, but then if you go back into MMS preferences again it's still checked OR Doesn't work and says &quot;Manual MMS settings are required for your phone&quot;. Is it possible to use Textsecure for only SMS on KitKat?

		It's nice that TextSecure can be a drop in replacement for the text app. However when it sends a text to someone it sends the real phone number as the sender. It'd be nice to be able to send my Google Voice number instead as that's the public facing number I am using and it won't surprise my contacts with my real number sending the message. Thanks!

		When using the SELinux feature default deny, TextSecure is not allowed to read SMS. In order to import the messages, this permission has to be requested/manually given of course. But when a user forgets to set the permission before starting TextSecure for the first time, it is not possible to import the messages except if the app is un- and reinstalled. It would be great if the message import could be manually started at a later point.

		I've read on various sources that TextSecure uses data/GCM to send messages, but I haven't seen this mentioned explicitly anywhere. Since data is usually free but SMS cost, can you be more explicit (both in the UI and in docs) about whether the message will go over data or over SMS?

		I am using No Stranger SMS to filter SMS messages, it works with all other SMS apps, except for TextSecure, that is, the messages that should be filtered shows up in inbox. I get lots of spam, so using any messaging app that bypasses the filters is quite annoying. For the record, I am using AOKP ROM, Android version: 4.3 on Galaxy Nexus.

		This only happens when using dark theme. When you type an sms, you can barely see the text you are typing, as it is white on white background. When you press Send, then the already sent SMS appears fine (white text on black background). Perhaps, you need to change the type message text to dark gray, as opposed to white. Also, to have the complete dark theme experience, it would make sense to have the welcome screen also theme changeable. For now, it stays white background/black text regardless of the theme chosen. Thanks.

		I think you should try to make it act more like stock messaging with the back button. When I am running the app, selecting the texts to read from the message bar, they always just add on top of the previous views, even if they are the same view. As an example, I just read three texts from my friend, then five from my girlfriend, now I want back to the main menu and I have to hit the back button eight times to get back to the main menu. That does not seem intuitive and I could see that causing memory issues.

		Using 1.0.6 on KitKat, Moto X, T-Mobile LTE. I send a group message to three other recipients - MMS conversation mode, everybody receives it, all is well. Responses come in, and aren't appended to the thread I started however. Two recipients who use iPhones (if that matters) responses are appended to my 1-1 threads with them, respectively (both have group messaging via MMS enabled on their phones). The message details for these responses confirm that they were sent over MMS. Responses from the other recipient, who is using the Android Messaging app, are appended to a different group thread with the same recipients (and if I delete that, it creates a new thread). But her responses are the only ones that ever end up in that thread, because everyone else's goes to their own 1-1 threads with me. She also has group messaging via MMS enabled. Other MMS (picture messages) work fine (I haven't customized the MMS proxy settings at all). I'm thinking this has to be something on TextSecure's end, but I can't really figure out why -- let me know what other message/log info I can provide to track it down?

		Feature request: Could TextSecure have an option to pass the encrypted SMS message (or preferably dummy replacements like &quot;TextSecure encrypted [SMS/MMS]&quot;) into the standard database? This may fix the issue for applications which read the standard SMS database history for accounting and would allow messaging history (but not decrypted text) to be viewed in the standard SMS client. It would also allow Tasker to perform actions on SMS arrival (again without access to the decrypted text). UI options could change a radio buttons such as: o Use only TextSecure for SMS messages o Use only TextSecure for encrypted SMS messages o Use TextSecure and standard delivery for SMS Rationale: Inbound encrypted SMS messages don't trigger Tasker notifications, and outbound messages don't seem to appear in my DroidStats SMS accounting. Similarly neither inbound or outbound encrypted messages appear in the default messenger (cyanogenmod). Unencrypted text messages seem to trigger Tasker fine on arrival, presumably after being checked by TS. WhisperSystems#8 has note that there's no standard API for writing to the SMS database, but I hope (possibly uninformed) it'd be possible to allow the SMS message to continue the regular delivery path (as is the case with unencrypted text) after TextSecure sees it. WhisperSystems#464 notes that TextSecure can't use the standard SMS DB for its own storage, however it may be acceptable to have (encrypted or dummy) messages stored in both. WhisperSystems#324 seems to be the reverse of this request - I'd like to be able to have TextSecure not intercept encrypted text if desired. Here in Australia SMS messages potentially cost $US 0.30 - 0.50 after hitting a &quot;cap&quot; and as TextSecure is potentially sending SMS silently for key exchange or having SMS broken into multiple messages after encryption could lead to &quot;bill shock&quot; for users not aware of it. Apologies if this has already been raised - I didn't see anything directly suggesting this. EDIT: Typo

		When starting to write a new sms e.g. by clicking on the &quot;+&quot; sign in the left bottom corner, the screen changes to the composing screen, and the cursor is placed in the &quot;To&quot; field (and blinking) to start writing some chars - but the onscreen keyboard is hidden - you have to tap into the inout field again to open the keyboard. This is an unnecessary step - the keyboard should be opened automatically here.

		I have found that if you place a plus 1 in front of you number that you are texting it will not allow you to send the text message. I'm not sure if this is a problem but its obviously not urgent. I just updated my contacts and removed the one before the ten digits.

		I read that you're working towards using your own servers for the messages instead of going through the regular text service. I would prefer to continue using my phones regular text service as I have unlimited texts, but a limited amount of data usage per month. So I thought I'd throw this out here to suggest you continue supporting the option to use the default texting service. Maybe have an option under settings called &quot;use textsecure servers for messages.&quot; Could even have it checked by default if you wanted, but I'd prefer to continue using my phone providers default service.

		Whenever an iPhone user attempts to text me a contact from their phone (a &quot;vcard&quot; I believe) TextSecure grinds to a halt and invariably crashes. In order to resolve this, I have to delete the message thread that contains the contact. The contact comes in as a huge block of text. It might just be more data in one message than TextSecure expects. Currently running on a Galaxy SG3 with Cyanogenmod 10.2

		Currently the defined authentication methods for TextSecure are tightly coupled with the underlying authentication mechanism. This makes it difficult to add new mechanisms for authentication as all clients must be updated to support the new mechanism. For example, if you previously authenticated a TextSecure user and wish to call that user then you cannot rely on the previous TextSecure authentication to identify the user. With the generic method defined here, clients will not require code changes to support new authentication mechanisms, and if a separate authentication layer is used, such as Redphone, then the user may not need to re-authenticate users.

		I am trying to migrate from my old phone to my new one (both are android, old one is galaxy nexus running cyanogenmod, new one is stock verizon galaxy note 3) I tried both encrypted and plain text exports, but when I tried to import, it couldn't find the plain text to import, and when I imported the encrypted texts it acted like it worked, but all the messages show up &quot;unable to decrypt&quot;. I tried using the same passphrase and still saw the error. Any ideas? Should this work?

		This bug only appears to be present when the Android OS opens a dialog. Using a long-press, I try to select a phone number that someone text me, but KitKat opens the &quot;Complete action using&quot; dialog. After dismissing the KitKat dialog the TextSecure dialog Copy text. Delete message. Message details. Forward message. appears. I select &quot;copy text&quot; and it copies text that wasn't even on my screen. If I select a part of the message that doesn't open the KitKat dialog this bug does not occur.

		The emoji on the stock Android 4.2.2 keyboard are different than the one displayed in the messages' bodies. These icons are correctly displayed in Hangouts. As an example, the cats are all different. The facial expressions are the same; the fonts are merely different. I would type them here, but GitHub is complaining about them (Unicode, of course). Is this something that could conceivably be changed within TextSecure, or is it a limitation imposed by Android?

		It would be nice if I could share keys with someone using a QR code, which would not waste an SMS or send them funny messages they initially do not understand the purpose of. It would be very easy: I stand next to them, show them my QR code key, they select my contact page in their phone book and scan my key from there, done.

		It appears that TextSecure collects messages, even group MMS texts, under the sender. This makes it impossible to see group conversations as one thread, and replies go to that sender, not the group. If I've got this correct, can this be fixed?

		When I receive a group text from another phone also running TextSecure, it includes me in the recipient list. That is, the sender might see, &quot;2 recipients in group&quot; while I will see 3. When I reply, it fails, I assume, because it is trying to also send to myself. The third recipient looks like +1xxxyyyzzzz while the other recipients have their first names. Is there some setting that I'm missing where I can tell TextSecure my phone number so that it leaves it out of replies? I've tried making sure that &quot;my&quot; contact card in contacts/people has my phone number, including the leading &quot;+1&quot;.

		Using Text Secure v1.0.6, released on Dec 7 to Google app store. Using Nexus 4, with Android 4.4.2 on WIND Mobile network. Step to reproduce: Using app, send SMS message whenever there is no service (or bad service), so SMS is failed to send. Defect: There is no indication, that SMS is failed to sent. SMS resent (retry) only after 24 hours. Expected: There is indication, that SMS is failed to sent. SMS resent after short period of time (ideally as soon, as there is a service available)

		I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of &quot;where&quot; the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

		Hey. Sorry for the offtopic. I am writing here to clarify some points : If I should TextSecure application, but the person to whom I am sending sms has no application TextSecure and doesn't has Cyanogenmod, he will not Encrypted message, a simple sms ? Can I use this app as a replacement for stock sms app ? Can I disable the encryption of messages? Disabling encryption is still a text message will go through your servers ? Is not that dangerous ? Not working correctly notified LED indicator. When setting the frequency of blinking notification is not blinking, steady ( Acer Liquid E (message icon on top of the phone). Thank you for the program. P.S. Sorry for my English language.

When a message arrives in TextSecure, display sms messages constantly active (not blinking?constant light). In the settings TextSecure changed color LEDs, choose the type of flashing (fast, medium, slow to adjust), nothing helped - Notification icon is lit continuously, not blinking.

		From time to time a SMS from someone not using TextSecure is advertized in the status bar as &quot;Encrypted message&quot; whereas it is obviously not encrypted. More worrying is that some encrypted messages are displayed in clear in the status bar sometimes too although the message is encrypted using TextSecure. I'm using TextSecure on FreeXperia Android based on CyanogenMod 10.

		Apps which use SMS commands for remote activation (such as prey/prey-android-client) cannot be used on a phone running TextSecure. Is it possible for TextSecure to have a user-configurable whitelist of txt messages (such as &quot;GO PREY&quot;) which it knows to pass along unencrypted to standard SMS database for whatever other apps are triggered by incoming SMS? (I'm not an android developer so I may have this all wrong, but in the case of Prey it looks like the receive priority is already MAX_INT - https://github.com/prey/prey-android-client/blob/161bae8c113d93022d057952793931a3de350486/AndroidManifest.xml#L210 . My diagnosis could be wrong - the &quot;go prey&quot; txt didn't work for me and appeared to have been swallowed by TextSecure, Googling the problem gave confirmation bias)

		Last night my phone updated from 4.1.2 to 4.3 and in doing so I have become locked out of my textsecure. I am positive of my key to unlock the app. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is there a possiblity of it defaulting to some other value? Could the key file have been disturbed or corrupted during the update? Thank you in advance for any assistance.

		Hello I was running cyanogenmod 10.2 before (android 4.3) and using text secure there was no problem with flash sms, but in 11 (4.4), I have to enable hangout as my default sms application before I get flash sms. I use flash sms for remote login, so you can understand its a bit tedius to change back and forth all the time :) Thanks for an otherwise great piece of software!

		When choosing a recipient with several numbers, I want some visual indicator on how they're saved in my address book. The autocomplete first gives a vanity number, then autosuggests contacts on a alphabetical order. Given only 1 contact matches, with several numbers, like following .vcf, I don't have any visual indication in the textsecure app which number is which: TEL;CELL:+49150123456789 TEL;WORK:+4930987654321 TEL;CELL;PREF:+4850123456789 EMAIL;PREF:alice@rabbithole END:VCARD As a human being, I consider these numbers not really human memorizable, but I don't have a problem distinguishing work/cell/home/preferred. Ideally the auto complete suggestion order would be: TEL;CELL;PREF TEL;CELL; TEL;WORK TEL;HOME Right now they're being used in fifo-way, I'm suggesting that order because, preferred makes sense to have that one first, after that, a mobile phone, because well, it can probably receive SMS, work and home might be able to receive SMS, but maybe also not. I tried making a screenshot of what I meant, but apparently textsecure blackens them.

		TextSecure decides to use US formatted numbers instead of my regional or national numbers. I tried both international and regional numbers for this contact but when attempting to setup a secure session I get: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientFormattingException: Recipient: 012-345-678901 is badly formatted. The behavior seems to be somewhat random - sometimes I get it for the key exchange, sometimes for non-encrypted messages while the session is being set up (which fails as the exchange message is not sent) - now, after setting my phone language to local I got it to work (although it took a few attempts). So this means for me: When I set my phone to English it never works, as TextSecure always attempts to use the US numbering scheme. Doesn't matter whether or not the number is stored as an international one (+49012345678901) or a regional one (012345678901). When I set my phone to my native Language it sometimes works.

		On previously android version i used to have the default sms app (now is hangouts) and textsecure that i use only for particular contacts. But the issue now is that i receive double notification, one crypted sms in hangouts and the same sms decrypted in textsecure. As i already said i don't want to disable hangouts notification or set textsecure by default because i use it only for particular contacts and for the other i want the sms on hangouts, as before 4.4 version

		The symptoms are these. I send a message as follows (I'm not French so excuse any errors): &quot;Je suis déjà chez moi, mais si tu es empêchée je peux aller voir si le carrefour a quelque chose?&quot; ...and my friend receives the following: &quot;Je suis déjà chez moi, mais si tu es empêchée je peux aller voir sécurité, donc j'espère que ça restera fixed!&quot; The &quot;second half&quot; of the message received isn't garbage, it seems to be something that occurred previously in our conversation. I'm using TextSecure but sending a plaintext message, and the recipient is using the vanilla messaging client. Versions: me: Cyanogenmod / Android 4.3.1, TextSecure version I wish I knew, installed 2 weeks ago from google play store. them: Android 4.0.4 It's worth noting that this behaviour happened back when I was using the HTC stock OS, which was I believe Android 2.4 or something, again with the newest TextSecure. It doesn't happen all the time, but on about 10% of the messages, perhaps? We have a pretty big (±1000) thread going, that might be it, I haven't seen it with other people. It's not impossible that on their phone stuff is breaking, but they assure me it never happens with anyone else. I'd like to help troubleshoot this because I like TextSecure a lot, so please ask away if by any chance I've forgotten something.

		If you send a text message that includes a URL and you have a default action specified for that protocol, the action is performed on the release instead of allowing you to choose an action from the context menu. For example, if you have a default browser and send the text: &quot;Check out this website: http://www.google.ca&quot; If you LongClick on the text (anywhere, not just on the URL), you will see the the context menu appear with 4 options, but as soon as you release, the browser will open. Pressing back from the browser does not allow you to select one of the context menu options. The only work around I've found is to use 2 fingers and choose the option you want with the other finger before the browser opens. If you don't have a default browser, you can hit back to open the context menu after the 'open with...' dialog appears. No other applications should be launched on a LongClick.

		As someone who doesn't do any android programming, I am having a hard time reading the source code to find out what crypto is actually going on in this app. The description says local and on-the-wire encryption, but more specifically what methods are being used? I would appreciate a note in the description and in the app (a &quot;crypto details&quot; info page, if you will) which makes it clear to users what standards TextSecure is using. E.g. when I use https, chrome tells me I'm using encryption with the little lock. But, as an interested user I can click for more info to find that my connection to github uses 128-bit encryption, TLS 1.2, encrypted/authenticated using AES_128_GCM, with ECDHE_RSA key exchange. The more I know about what crypto is publicly claimed to be in use, the more faith I have in the open source peer reviewed nature of the app, and the better suited I will be to avoid improper (insecure) use of the app's features.

		Phone A and B have registered themselves to use data channel. Phone B gets into some form of conversation with Phone A just to guarantee a session exists and Phone A is aware of Phone B's identity. Phone B deregisters, clears data, starts over again and reregisters to data channel. Phone B starts new group with Phone A as member. Phone A sees the new group, but also sees a separate conversation start with a click-to-confirm for the new identity. When you click to confirm, you get a dump of the encoded group action message as if it were a normal text.

		First, THANK YOU for the latest version. It is rocking for me so far. Question: Where do MMS groups go when you create them? I create and name a group, and am able to start a group MMS convo. That is working flawlessly. But, if I delete that particular thread, I cannot seem to locate the previously created group to re-use. Note: None of the people in the group I created use Textsecure, if that makes a difference. Rooted Nexus 5 with stock ROM. Again, thank you for this product! Thanks!

		After updating to 2.0 I had some problems using the Push-Feature of the new version and decided to reinstall the app. I made a BackUp of my encrypted SMS and personal Key / Public Keys of my contacts. After importing the backup, every sms was properly available (and decryptable), but when I tried to look at the public keys of all of my contacts, the APP FCs continuously. Deleting all data and setting up a new account resolved the problem. Maybe there is some usefull information in this issue :). If not, just delete it.

		Started with TextSecure Beta, working key exchange between 2 devices. Installed TextSecure2 and configured the cloud settings. Sending messages from A to B works. Messages from B to A never seem to arrive at A. When scanning eachother's codes, B confirms A's key is correct. However A warns that B's key is incorrect. In the menu with the keys of the contacts, there is no delete option available. When clicking the lock in the conversation, the only menu item is to verify the keys.

		In the most recent version (version 2.0) with the Dark Theme selected, the textbox that one types a message into uses a black font on a dark background. This makes it very hard to read while entering your message. Once you hit send, the text is shown with a white font, which is much easier to read. To increase readability, could we switch this font color to white while entering a text as well?

		Some contacts on my Android address book get phone numbers from several sources (such as other IM systems or address information from an infamous social network I won't mention here) but TextSecure doesn't check if those numbers are in fact the same. So, TextSecure offers me in that case to choose from: Mobile +491717654321 Mobile +491717654321 Mobile +49 171 7654321 Which are all the same.

However, sending the second message or any message after the first one seems to fail with &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot;.

			<description>
		When I have a contact who also uses TextSecure and I want to verify that we have properly set up a secure channel, we perform an out of band verification of the Idenity Key Fingerprints. There are two ways (that I can tell) to see my own Identity Fingerprint. One is through the lock on the conversation page (the left in the image), and the other is through the main menu (the right) As you can see, they don't agree. So far the person who I've tested with has seen the key on the right and not the key on the left (which is the one that I'm being told to read to them).

		When I first installed TextSecure, I set it up using my phone's number provided by my carrier. After some testing, I decided to register my Google Voice number instead. Not seeing a clear way to unregister my existing number, I wiped the app data through settings, and then registered again using my Google Voice number. My old number still appears to be registered, so if a TextSecure user tries to send a message using the PUSH transport, those messages are silently dropped. If the other user disables PUSH and uses SMS, I do receive the messages he sends to me, but they are encrypted to my old key (which is what I would expect). He sees both my current identity key (which is working fine) and my old identity key, but there's no apparent way to remove the old one.

		Currently TextSecure uses just the phone number as they are in the address book. libphonenumber would create sane formatting throughout and even make it possible to localise phone numbers, like I think it is doing in Hangouts. IMO this would improve the usability for many users. To see only the national format even though the international format is stored in the address book. https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/

		When tapping group notifications in the notification drawer, TextSecure tries to address a reply to the person who was responsible for the last received message in a group chat. The group name also changes to the phone number + name of the personal contact that TextSecure tries to reply to, instead of the usual group name. Any messages sent through this particular window will end up in the personal chat of the last respondent instead of the group chat. In order to reproduce: Open inbound group message through notification drawer Try to send a message in the group chat window within TextSecure. (Notice that the group name has changed to the person who sent the last reply so far.) Attempt to send a message to the group, only to have it end up in the personal message conversation of the person who sent the last message in the group chat.

		I can't get the Push directory to update and recognize the new number format with the country code. This is happening for a couple of contacts which I already had in my address book as &quot;zone-number&quot; and later edited to &quot;+country-zone-number&quot; so the universal ID would work. I already had TextSecure working before the push update as SMS app. Wanted to give the Push feature a try, so: I had a contact with the following number: Juan de los Palotes (011)-5555-4444 I edited said number to: Juan de los Palotes +54-11-5555-4444 But, even though I see the new number in my android contacts listing (editing the subject), and in the TextSecure interface if I press the &quot;plus&quot; to write a new message I see the name and the new number below it (in the listing of all the contacts), when I click the user, it takes me to my message thread with said user, where the name above has the old number below it. If I disable SMS/MMS and fallback mode, the message fails with &quot;Error sending message&quot;. The background is green, and in message details it shows the transport is SMS. If I enable SMS or fallback mode, it's sent vía SMS. So, SMS is working every time (old number or new number), but I can't get the app to recognize the number with the new format in push mode, even though I went to &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Refresh Push Directory&quot; after editing the contact. Even restarted the phone just in case I needed to log-out/in. Also worth noting: My friend can send me push notifications in the same chat thread. He sees his chats as blue, while mine are always green. If I long press and see the message details for his messages, I see they are &quot;Push&quot;. Another update: Mobile: Sony Xperia Mini Pro Android: 2.3.3 Tested through wifi and 3g.

		The option in the configuration settings to disable SMS, and go push-only is currently greyed out on my phone. By tweeting at Moxie, I learned that the reason for this is that TextSecure is currently set to be the default SMS app. Rather than greying out the option, and not letting the user turn Whisper's SMS feature off, perhaps it would be better to have a usable error message when the user clicks the greyed out checkbox. Telling them why it is greyed out, telling them how to remedy it, or perhaps even allowing them to make something other than Whisper the default SMS app from within the Whisper config would all be better.

		Phone: Motorola Defy XT O/S: Android 2.3.7 Provider: Republic Wireless Possibly related: my provider does not support MMS messages (at least not on my plan/model of phone). Steps to reproduce: 1.) Send message to someone who has the latest version of TextSecure (as of 2/24/2014) 2.) Message was not encrypted 3.) Attempt to initiate secure session via the unlock icon 4.) Green speech bubble appears from the right with a key icon which says &quot;Error sending message&quot; 5.) Register phone number over cell data plan/SMS, failed 6.) Go home, turn on wifi, connect to AP, register phone number successfully 7.) Now secure testing works as expected There are two reasons I don't like this: A.) I'd prefer to not be on a list of phone numbers that use TextSecure. I don't understand why such a list exists. B.) Since the new protocol doesn't appear to require SMS nor MMS, I would like to be able to use TextSecure via WiFi on a phone with no provider. If registration was not required, or if it were possible to register without providing a phone number and requiring that an SMS be sent/received, it seems like this would work fine. It'd be especially awesome if it would integrate with SIP/VoIP.

		This is a feature request. It would be very handy if I can enable SMS fallback only for the contacts in my country but disable them for contacts out of my country. Usually out-of-country SMS rates are quite high and can run up quite a bill if you have the feature enabled to fallback on SMS. Thanks.

		The unlocked icon currently used by the app is an AOSP icon and thus makes it a little confusing identifying which notification is for TextSecure and for other apps that use the same icon. For example: My Moto X uses the same icon to distinguish whether the device is connected to a trusted bluetooth device or not. I propose that the &quot;unlocked&quot; status icon be changed to something unique that identifies the unlocked status, specifically to TextSecure. Here is an example of a sample icon I whipped up that I think conveys the &quot;unlocked&quot; state of TextSecure, without drawing the same attention a user might have for a receieved message (the green icon). I have included a screenshot of my Moto X to show the similarity in icons and how this could be confusing for some users.

This is on regular Android 4.2 on the Fairphone. I have Xprivacy installed but set it to allow everything TextSecure asks for, and AFWall+ but also configured it to allow TextSecure. RedPhone can register with the server just fine. It doesn't matter whether TextSecure is on the Internal or Phone Storage. If there's any othe relevant information I can provide or things I should try, please let me know here. Thanks.

		When using TextSecure v2.0.1 with only push messages enabled (no SMS fallback) one still has to select a phone number to sent a secure message to another TextSecure user. That seems unnecessary, and even confusing, as the message sent will be sent over the data channel. So why bother the user with a phone number?

		When using TextSecure v2.0.1 with only push messages enabled (no SMS fallback) creating a new thread by clicking on the '+' sign, all contacts are displayed. Confirmed TextSecure contacts are displayed in a bold font. Non-TextSecure contacts are displayed with a regular font. As we do not have the SMS fallback enabled why does TextSecure even bother displaying non-TextSecure users. This is confusing. Please do not display non-TextSecure users if SMS fallback has been disabled. When SMS fallback has been enabled, please consider making the distinction between TextSecure and non-TextSecure user more distinctive. Bold vs Regular font is not distinctive enough. Use different background color for instance.

		My carrier and some other companies sometimes send SMS with alphanumeric addresses. When TextSecure receives them, it shows sender as Anonymous. Also, it won't import them from system database (i. e. SMS will not show in TextSecure in any way). I have saved few such messages on my phone (Galaxy Nexus) and I know a tiny bit about Android development, so if there anything I can check/send to help resolve the issue, I will be glad to help.

		When another application is configured as the default SMS application on Android 4.4, TextSecure still intercepts and stores incoming SMS messages, but outgoing messages (sent with the other application) are missing in the conversation thread in TextSecure. When a user wants to only use TextSecure for secure messaging, those threads (containing one side of an unencrypted conversation) can be distracting. It should be possible to (optionally) restrict TextSecure to only store encrypted messages (and leave unencrypted messages to the default application). Alternatively, the telephony provider should be used to import sent messages so that at least both sides of the conversation are visible in TextSecure.

		When TS is the default SMS/MMS app, the Allow SMS fallback option is grayed out. That means the user has no control over when SMS are sent to non-TS contacts. It just happens (and the user incurs the costs). I suggest to replace this checkbox: Allow SMS fallback [X]
 With a popup menu: SMS fallback       [Allow | Allow but warn | Off]
 Allow means SMS are always sent if the receiver doesn't have TS or the phone is not on a Wifi/bluetooth network. Allow but warn means that the send icon (the paper plane) will be overlaid with a little SMS speech bubble with an exclamation mark inside (I'm happy to do this icon). Also, whenever a new thread is started where fallback SMS must be used and the user presses the send icon, a warning pop-up will be displayed (which could have a Never show this again checkbox). This could also be displayed when the receiver goes offline during a conversation (see #678). Off means the send icon will be grayed out when the phone is not on a Wifi/bluetooth network. (Receivers w/o TS should be filtered out from the contacts list in this case, see #664). It still means TextSecure will receive all SMS if it is the default messaging app on the phone. Emergency numbers should always be excluded from this, ofc.

		Capitalization is all over the place at the moment. See https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/settings.html for capitalization rules. Example of inconsistent/wrong capitalization: Saving attachment to SD card... (card is all lowercase) but then Unable to write to SD Card! (Card is capitalized, should be lowercase) Examples of wrong capitalization: SMS Fallback should be SMS fallback. Refresh Push Directory should be Refresh push directory The writing guidelines in the link above state that &quot;[...] proper nouns are capitalized&quot;. This means only words like 'Bluetooth', 'SMS', etc. should be capitalized. Everything else, after the 1st word, must always be lowercase.

		Currently, when both the sender and reciever are using the push option, if the sender is online, but the receiver isn't, the sender doesn't fall back to SMS. It just sends a message over data which only arrives when the receiver gets an internet connection. Perhaps have a delivery confirmation over data, if said confirmation isn't received within a time frame, fall back to SMS.

		after we start to test 2.0.1 it seem to working. but when i turn of my phone for 5 minutes and my friends send me a new message during this time the message lost forever. the strange thing is that after turn on and send a new message it is arrived. so in his message list &quot;test, test2, test3&quot; while mine is &quot;test, test3&quot; and the message detail of test2 also said &quot;sent/received ...&quot;!!! but there is only one date. so it's actually arrived 5 hours later, BUT on the sender side there is only one &quot;Sent/Received&quot; line which is the real send date, but on the receiver side there are two &quot;Sent&quot; &quot;Received&quot; line where the second is 5 hours later. even if the phone was offline only for 5 minutes. it'd be very useful like in case of viber: sent delivered read status for all message and not only in the message details, but inline with the messages.

		Currently the CyanogenMod TextSecure setup process is very opaque about what exactly TextSecure will do, and how it will use SMS. This is a problem because anyone who pays per message needs and wants to know exactly what's going to happen if they start using this app in a chatty way - will it send a lot of SMS, none, some? When? The CM setup for TextSecure needs to make it very clear that SMS will not be sent between TextSecure devices, and also make it easy to ensure that SMS will not be sent without TextSecure prompting to do so. I have repeatedly disabled TextSecure when installing CM because these facts are not made clear at setup, and I already use WhatsApp - whereas, having now learned about how TextSecure works, it seems like a much better improvement for me then WhatsApp while providing the same functionality.

		I just converted one of my friends to TextSecure and we tested the &quot;compare identities&quot;-feature. We encountered a very odd behaviour: His key in my &quot;contact keys&quot;-section is different to his key in his &quot;My Identiy Key&quot;-Section. When we try to scan our keys to verify the recipient, his key is different to the key I got from him, therefore I can't verify the integrity. (I don't think I am under special surveillance from NSA/BND, so I don't think I am the victim of a Man-In-The-Middle or something). Our messages are send encrypted (according to the padlock), and we can read each other's messages. How is this possible? I don't see any option to reset / delete any keys, so I am not able to just initiate a new key exchange.

		I always save my phone numbers in the international format +49 ... (for Germany). I have one contact, where TextSecure will not recognize the + and therefore tries to send messages to an invalid number, which obviously will fail. I had this before the 2.0 update, but there it could be fixed by recreating the thread manually. This fix doesn't work with 2.0+ anymore, which is really annoying because I can't send messages/SMS to that contact.

		If I've encrypted my messages once, I don't need to re-authenticate every now and again. The app should make users' lives easier not add a hurdle. If a user wants their phone secured, they're likely to have a system wide lock or even an app lock. But a users shouldn't have to re-enter their password just to open their messages because the app is being overzealous. I also suggest using the Android AccountManager: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html

When I try to register for the same, it is says that the phone is not supported for data messaging. It says that I need to have PlayStore installed. Can you please explain why PlayStore is needed and since playstore installed means, I need to have a Google account, can I do something so that I dont need PlayStore.

		I would like to have the option to opt-out of the SMS functionality on first start.. Many people don't have an unlimited plan on SMS or would like to send international messages. Especially for non-technical users, the SMS functionality can be very confusing and can result in (high) costs. A dialog asking whether this app should be used as SMS app with optional PUSH service or as PUSH service with optional SMS fallback or only SMS or only PUSH would help a lot.

		I just got disconnected from data right before messaging another TextSecure v2 user, who only uses TextSecure with Push and does not have SMS/MMS enabled. Since I have &quot;Allow SMS Fallback&quot; enabled, this made my phone send out the message as an SMS (green background). That message is still &quot;sending&quot; now that I came back to have a data connection. But TextSecure should know that the other side cannot receive an encrypted SMS, right? So I think this is a bug: encrypted SMS should only be sent if both sides use TextSecure for SMS.

		Serious bug that can render conversation with a specific contact almost un-usable. Particular case: My friend had TextSecure, but uninstalled it when he re-flashed his ROM. In the previous version of TextSecure I simply pressed padlock&gt;abort secure session. However, since the update my phone tries to send him encrypted texts over data. None of these he receives because he does not have the app installed anymore. I can long-press send to enable the option to &quot;send unencrypted&quot; however, when sending sms over data is enabled, it will still send encrypted even though I instructed it not to do so. This is another bug. The only way to send him texts anymore is to disable sms over data in settings, and then long-press send to send unencrypted, only then will the app actually send an unencrypted text message. I have to do this every time I want to reply to him. It's greatly annoying. So in a nutshell, the three problems are: App does not check that user actually still uses TextSecure, and forces a secure connection even when one cannot be made. There is no easy way to force the app to send unencrypted texts to a user when data mode is enabled. When data mode is disabled, the method is still unclear and requires &quot;send unencrypted&quot; to be chosen each time you want to send a message. The removal of &quot;abort secure session&quot; has made this problem very bad, I cannot delete old keys from my key inventory. Long-press the send button when data is enabled to access &quot;send unencrypted&quot; does not work. Will always revert to sending an encrypted message. These three problems make the app almost unusable with certain contacts who have uninstalled TextSecure.

		A friend was offline in TextSecure v2 until a few minutes ago. I had sent out two messages in the meantime: the first over push, the second over encrypted SMS. The SMS was received by my friend, but got stuck in &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot;, see bug #240. No Push message was shown as received. After TextSecure restart, the SMS was decrypted. But the push message never showed up and seems to be lost. I'm wildly guessing that while SMS receive was stuck, the Push message was still stuck in processing queue (albeit being sent out first; but it was probably received later than the SMS), and after app restart it was just gone. The SMS was seemingly cached to be available and decryptable after app force close, but the GCM message wasn't.

		It would be nice TextSecure hat an option to not download attachments automatically. When you are part of many groups you get a lot of pictures and videos that you do not really care about. This may be fine on a free WiFi but can quickly reduce volume of a mobile data plan. I propose a setting &quot;Automaitc download of attachments&quot; with options &quot;always&quot;, &quot;only on wifi&quot; and &quot;never&quot;.

		Person A creates new group, invites persons B and C and sends message. B leaves group after sending a message and deletes group thread. A adds B again to group. B now gets new group messages, but can't leave again or send any more messages to group. Happened to me on a Galaxy S4 with Android 4.3. I can delete the group thread, but it will appear again as soon as a new message is posted to the group.

		Sharing files or links to W****app brings up a window with your running conversations as a first choice. TextSecure shows a &quot;Compose Message&quot; window when shared to. The problems are that you... have to select the correct phone number of the contact you are looking for again do not get any indication about the contact being on TextSecure or not (green bar) do not have the ability to chose groups. TextSecure should also present the running conversations (single user and group) first because those are the most likely receivers.

		I was trying to text a friend, and my messages wouldn't go through to him. The messages were in a blue background(data stream), and he says he didn't receive it. He's on the latest update as well. I also tried a new session with Push disabled in the settings, and the key exchange message went through, but when I tried texting him through SMS(encrypted), he didn't receive anything. On #682, I saw moxie0 mention something about registering on more than one server. I accidentally registered twice, I'm not sure if that's the problem. I've tried other roms before, and it had a WhisperSystems app on it, that I might've registered before. Is there anyway for me to unregister so I can re-register it? I'm not sure what to do here.

		I would love to see some improvements in the contacts lists, especially when starting a new conversation with another of my phonebook contacts. Make the small green bar on the left way more apparent. It should be used at least like a traffic light: Show me, if the contact uses TextSecure or not, if he is registered to Push-Service and if I manually verified his key. Add the usual pictures of my contacts to this list. Merge several numbers of the same contact to one entry, even if he registered separately with each number Give some advanced filtering methods like &quot;show only contacts in stage X (see listpoint 1) Group contacts by firstname/lastname and even by filter (listpoint 4) Some people told me especially the determination right out of the contacts (bevor the first message was send!) whether TextSecure sends SMS or PUSH is absolutely crucial. I would love to see those improvements! Keep the great work up :).

		When I receive an MMS, I get a notification in the notification bar, but it does not vibrate. When I open the message, I am required to click the 'download' button. When it downloads the image or MMS contents, it then vibrates. Can we get an option in the menu to automatically download MMS when they are received (Maybe only on WiFi)? Or at least vibrate when the message is received, not when it is downloaded. I've also seen an issue where the main contacts list does not show an undownloaded MMS's thread that I haven't opened as being unread, and does not sort it to the top of the list where other unread messages are, based on received times. If I don't click on the notification, I have to remember who it was from, and scroll down to find my thread with them. I believe these two issues are related.

		I would really appreciate the option to have the full Sent timestamp, up to the minute, appear below each message, e.g.: Hey, what's up? Tue Feb 25, 2014 @ 11:16 PM Ideally I would want the option to control the exact date format. Short of that, optionally showing the entire timestamp would be a huge plus for me in terms of usability. Long pressing for message details takes too much time.

		I installed TextSecure 2.0.1 on a Android 4.04 phone. When activating push messages, key-generation succeeds but the keys can not be uploaded to the server. After approx. 1h, an error message appears indicating that the connection to the server timed out. I do have tried to do this from Wifi as well as 3G and ensure that there is no firewall that blocks me off. This phone is not linked to a Google Play account, I used the .apk file downloaded with my other phone (for which the registration from the same network worked like a charm). Is the missing Google Play account the problem here? If so, why? How can I debug this issue further? I would appreciate your feedback!

		I started a TextSecure conversation with a friend of mine a couple of days ago. Yesterday we updated to TextSecure 2.0 on both ends of our conversation and registered for push notifications. We still can send encrypted SMS. However neither of us can send messages through the data channel (we tried by disabling the SMS fallback). We always get the message &quot;Error sending message&quot;. Maybe this is related to the issue that we can't verify each other's keys anymore. Whenever we scan our keys, we get the message NOT verified! WARNING the scanned key does not match.

		When someone writes something in a group, it sometimes reaches me as a direct message from this person. This happend already two times in about an hour, both senders insist that they have postet their messages in the group. Edit: might be a duplicate of #632, but in addition, just now a message that has previously been in the group chat suddenly appears in the personal that with the corresponding person.

		When a person says something in a group chat and I get an Android notification, and then tap on the notification, it will throw me into a chat that looks like a chat with only that one person instead. The title states the name of the person that was shown in the notification, not of the group chat, and all the UI is the same as in a 1-on-1 chat. There are also no names displayed on top of the messages. The weird broken thing is that it will not actually be the chat with that person, but it will show messages from the group chat. I can even send messages there, it just gets very confusing because the messages appear to be sent only to that single person. It's a mere display error that can be fixed by exiting the chat with the person (tapping on left arrow in upper left corner of the screen) and then selecting the group chat again. It will then show as a group chat. No logs end up in the wrong place or anything, and the names of the people that sent you messages are correctly shown. I see this as a critical bug, since users might end up sending secret messages to a group containing other users, without being able to see that the other users are even there.

		I set up TextSecure, then sent an SMS to (non-TS User) person A. I then got a reply from person B (also not a TextSecure user) &quot;?&quot;. When I asked them what they were referring to, they explained they had received my first SMS intended for A. The SMS in question is still listed under the conversation with A and has never shown under the conversation list of person B in TextSecure. I have not tried to send an SMS with TextSecure since for obvious reasons, and have reverted back to my default SMS app (Hangouts) with which I have had no problems. Is there any kind of log I can provide to help with investigating this issue?

		In conversation view, every message has a timstamp and a lock symbol beneath it. This is taking up a lot of space, which I think is unnecessary. Therefore, I propose not to display the timestamp if it is the same as the previous messages or differs only by a certain amount of time (say, less than a minute). As the padlock should still be displayed, let me suggest aligning own messages to the left in multi-line message bubbles (Google Hangouts does it that way, too, and I find it a lot easier to read) and to place the padlock symbol at the right end of the last line. For single-line messages, either a margin and then the padlock in the same line would be imaginable. I believe that these changes would increase readability and orientation, as temporal pauses in conversation are easier to spot and more messages fit the screen without it looking cramped. (I also think that the spacing between messages is a little high in general, but that is a matter of preference I guess)

		Observed by myself and another user on a Nexus 5 and Nexus 4, both running Android 4.4.2 (stock) and TextSecure 2.0.1. When receiving plaintext SMS from non-TextSecure users the message gets stuck in the inbox say &quot;Decrypting, please wait&quot;. Closing TextSecure and re-starting results in successful display of the message. Both users are not using a passphrase. The symptoms are the same as #240, so this may be the same bug.

		Using TextSecure on an Xperia Z running Cyanogen Mod 11 nightly from Feb 24 (also previous 11 nightlies) When Passphrase is not cached, I will get a notification sound that I have a text. When I enter my passphrase into TextSecure there is no text there. I have confirmed with senders that a text was sent, it is just completely lost. They don't come through later or anything. I have only noticed this problem when the passphrase is not cached. I believe this happens every time that the situation arises.

		Using the groupchat feature yesterday I added 2 contacts and did not get the warning that they do not support the data channel (actually we were using the data channel before without problems). I sent a message to the group and it was sent out as MMS. Since MMS are disproportionately priced with my mobile plan I would love to disable MMS completely. Would entering gibberish settings in the manual MMS configuration dialog be a working workaround for this until this request ist decided/implemented?

		I have just installed and newly registered TextSecure 2.0.2 from the Market. Sending/reciving of encrypted msgs to/from another TextSecure user via SMS works fine, but the app does not switch to the data channel automatically. (All bubbles are green and by using the stock SMS app, I see the encrypted SMS msgs). As soon as I disable the &quot;SMS Fallback&quot; option, msgs are not send at all. http://hastebin.com/navowohexu Since I have to pay for each SMS this renders the app useless for me.

		After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

		I would love to see an increase in maximum video size transfer over push/data transfer. Currently I am unable to send even decently sized video and would like to see it increased as much as possible; this way TextSecure will be an even more valid option for users looking for a more secure venue of communication.

		There is one very confusing bug with groups: If you enter a group using the conversation list it shows the group name on the top and chat bubbles have the contact name above them. However, if you get a group message while the group is not displayed and enter it by pressing the system notification, the group will display as if it was a contact, e.g. it will show the name of the last person to talk inside the group as the group name and not show the contact names inside the chat window. Going back to the conversations list and entering the group again makes it show up correctly again.

		PLEASE add the ability to select or deselect multiple messages from within a thread to delete. Example: I have a thread which has the address of the contact contained in it. I can't delete the thread, because then I lose the address. If there are 300 other messages in that thread, I'd have to go through them one at a time to delete them and keep the 1 message I care about. GoSMSPro has this capability and is the ONLY reason I currently use it. I would prefer to go with TextSecure, but this one feature will keep me from doing so.

		A while ago, when i switched to CyanogenMod, i started whisper to have a look at. I switched then back to TextSecure with no problem. When i now try to activate the push messages in TextSecure i got this message: Registration conflict &quot;This number is already registered on a different textsecure server (cyanogenmod?). You must unregistering there before registering here.&quot; I don't want to switch to whisper. One advantage of TextSecure is the encrypted database of my messages. An other advantage is the import/export, because i like to switch my ROM sometimes and so i use this feature regularly. Hope now this question is right here - maybe it is not a direct Issue with TextSecure rather than CyanogenMod: Where and how can i unregister from the CyanogenMod-TextSecure-Server?

		I just build Version 2.0.3 from the sources, which i have to point out works really easy, thanks for that. I installed it on an Android 4.0.4 device but when i tried to register for push notifications it wont to so. I can connect to server, I get the SMS and can create a key. But registration takes forever (8h with a commit from yesterday, no fail but i tried the new commit, and about 1h with 038bebf) and than fails. From the issues i have read so far I am not sure if it could have something to do that i don't use any Google services? Play Store is installed though. Also the button on the error screen says &quot;null bearbeiten&quot;. Looks to me like the string for number is not handed to the RegistrationProgressActivity_edit_s here.

		In disabling push messages there is no confirmation box before it unregisters me. I've had a couple of instances where the settings menu delays in loading / double tap and got unregistered, just like that. A popup would prevent such annoyances since I can use cancel if I tapped it by mistake. Also, while registering. Typing non-numeric like * crashes the app and locks you out.

		The context is that I'm trying to write a linux/mac app for textsecure. As I do this I'm fixing up the path that authenticates a phone number with TS' servers, so I receive a lot of SMS (with confirmation numbers). A few of these take a long long time to load: I do get the notification that the SMS arrived, but when I try to see it, it only shows a white box with: &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot; The message is usually displayed after 20-40sec. But I got a few instances where the message wouldn't show up unless I kill TS and relaunch it. Interestingly, I have the setting &quot;Disable passphrase&quot; ticked, so I would not expect any encryption/decryption to take place. http://hastebin.com/xohasorolu

		Every time I start the app I get a fake notification from a contact that also has TS with the italic text &quot;Encrypted mesaage&quot; and a time stamp of the current time. If I click on it it takes me to the conversation with that contact, but there is no new message. This happens every single time I open up the app after clearing it from recent apps. I do not have encrypted storage enabled. Edit: it seems that after doing this a few times it turned into a bad encrypted message. All messages I send to that contact show up as bad encrypted message. So do the ones I get from them.

		If you forward a message, you will get a slightly &quot;unconventional&quot; dialogue, with the plus button to add target contacts... advantage of the current solution: You can insert a number that's not in the current contact list. - But how often do you need that? IMHO you should see a similar list as the list to create a new chat. But contact entry has a checkbox on the right side. Advantage: it is more intuitive and you see who has used TextSecure and who not.

		Yesterday morning my phone auto-updated TextSecure. I noticed the icon had just changed to the circular one, so clicked it, and authenticated. I followed the one-time process of registering on the server, and all seemed normal. Later, i found out that a message I'd sent on the 18th december (to two recipients) had just been received by them. I presume it had failed to send back in december due to bad signal or some such, and the software update had just tried it again (I know where I was when I sent the message has little or no signal a lot of the time). Seeing as the message was &quot;I'm in the pub&quot; and was sent at 8.15am, it lead to a few probing questions about my drinking habits ;-) Anyway, I doubt this is the sort of thing we can track down and &quot;fix&quot;, but I thought I'd mention it and see if anyone else was affected. TextSecure is showing version 2.0.2 right now, although I think it updated again during the night, so I'm not sure exactly which version sent the ancient unsent messages.

		Currently you can only confirm a fingerprint, if you read a QR-Code from anothers phone. This requires both chatters to be in the same place. This is at least the safest way, but there are other ways to do this nearly as secure as this. You could e.g. talk with someone on the phone, who dictates his fingerprint, so that you can confirm it by simply checking, if the code he's dictating matches the one, your phone is showing. So there should be an option, to confirm another ones fingerprint by simply telling the app &quot;Yes, I've checked/confirmed the fingerprint of my opposite.&quot; This would be similar to the way PGP fingerprint exchanges can work.

		Using Android 4.4 on a Nexus 4 together with Swift Key (a third party keyboard), I have no way to send emoticons using TextSecure. There's no emoticons icon on the left part of the textbox. The return button of Swift Key doesn't offer to add graphical emoticons as the stock Android keyboard allows. On a Android 2.3, the left part of the text box contains a button which lets you add smileys. Could this be added to newer Android devices running another keyabord than stock keyboard to allow sending emoticons?

		With the latest update, I cannot start a secure SMS session with someone I previously had one with. I also haven't been able to use the Push service, even after updating the Push Directory several times. This is on a Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini, Android 4.1.2. I can reproduce this on another device which also is a S3 Mini with 4.1.2, so may be that's related in any way.

		I've noticed with two different recipients that when chatting via data channel then it switches SMS, the recipient gets an 'unreadable encrypted message'. Sometimes had this issue on the data channel too. Deleting the chat and re-initializing the conversation seems to fix it, but problem does seem to exist. My device HTC One on CyanogenMod, Android 4.3.1. Not sure if this is enough information for bug report, but can provide more if specifics required. Thanks and keep up the great work! =)

It is inconvenient when I have my phone on silent sitting in front of me on my desk and the only notification is the LED blinking. Is there a way that it could be an option in the notification settings to enable waking the screen whenever a text/notification is received?

		A friend tries to chat with me but has low connectivity. This causes messages to be sent with a delay, of course. It seems like TS re-sends those messages after a while, but the first message still is &quot;queued&quot; somewhere and gets delivered, too. This way, I get the message twice (with different &quot;sent&quot; timestamps...).

		Sending certain emoticons from an Android 4.4 device to a phone with an older Android version leads to empty messages for the receiver: On the left side, the sending phone has Android 4.4, the phone on the right has Android 4.3 (Nexus 5 and Galaxy Nexus, both stock). As you can see, it does not effect all emoticons (my guess would be that this happens only with emoticons that are new to 4.4?). I also have a Nexus 4 (Android 4.4) user in the group who can see all emoticons, and a Galaxy 3 (Android 4.3) user who cannot see the same emoticons as the other 4.3 (Galaxy Nexus) user. So I'm pretty sure that the problem is related to the Android version (everybody is using TS 2.0.3). I don't even know if this issue can be addressed by TS, maybe by limiting the available emoticons to those that are available on all platforms (but this might require to get emoticons directly into the app and not the keyboard or something alike).

		Long pressing to bring up the context menu on individual messages does not block the short press action. For example: I sent a message to a friend which contained the https link to the TextSecure Play Store page and no other text. I then wanted to copy the message text to resend it to another friend. Long pressing on that message does bring up the context menu but it then activates the link and opens the Play Store app before the menu can be used.

		Android's multitasking features include a most recently used list of apps and thumbnail screenshots of their last state. This is a potential information leak. An assailant who has gained access to the user's device but does not know the password used for unlocking the TextSecure app and decrypting its local storage may still be able to gain access to secure information by looking at the thumbnail MRU and any cached copies which may still exist on or be recovered from the device's memory and filesystems. If possible it would be best to prevent these thumbnails from containing information in the first place by having the app feed the system a static image such as solid black or black with a logo.

To reproduce: Receive text message Drop down to notifications Tap message in notifications --&gt; message comes up Put phone to sleep Repeat this several times. Then: 5. From in the conversation, hit back. It will (apparently) take you back to the convo you were just at.

		Falling back is an useful feature to have turned on. However, I could think of several scenarios when the &quot;silent&quot; falling back behavior is not desired: When I send a message to a friend oversea and TextSecure is not available for that person: I will get charged a lot when the app silently falls back and proceeds to send the text oversea. When I send a message to a friend because I expected the friend to have TextSecure but actually they had turned it off for some reason: That means my communication is no longer secret. Imagine I am about to send something assuming it will be send securely, but at the moment the app sends it, it decides to falls back silently. I think an non-intrusive way to implement this is to warn the user in-line (in the chat message area) that the message cannot be delivered securely (or cannot be delivered securely anymore), and ask the user to tap the send button again to confirm sending it. They would have to tap the send button again to send that message in the insecure mode. Of course they only have to tap twice to switch from secure -&gt; insecure once. The next time they would have to tap only once since they already knew it. Of course, I think not everyone wants this feature, so I think it's sensible to have an option to warn the user, but have that turned off by default.

		I am currently evaluating the TextSecure app. I can compile it just fine, but there's two things i can't find sources for. One thing is the WhisperSystems/gson (dependency in library subproject) and the other is the armeabi.jar. I wonder if the gson library is 100% based on google's code? If so, why are you packaging your own lib? The same goes for android-support-lib and the gcm libraries. As for the armeabi.jar, i couldn't really track that one down. I would love to look into that, too. I hope, i'm not missing some obvious part of documentation or something. If I do, please just point me in the right direction. Cheers!

		Hello dear TextSecure Team, I did install you app on my mobile phone and find out that if I’m using 2G/3G/LTE network – I will never receive any message. But I can send them. I will receive all messages since I got connected to WiFi, or if I establish VPN through mobile network. Could you please investigate this issue? I did check with provider and they are not blocking any ports for me, Mobile Phone - Galaxy S3 LTE, Android 4.3. Provider Telekom Deutschland. Please let me know if you need more information. Kind Regards.

		Ups, sorry dupe of WhisperSystems#331 i took a picture with my stockROM Nexus 4 and it had a wrong orientation in the Gallery App. (mostly happens when i take picture from something on the table). I rotated it there to the correct orientation. When i send it via Textsecure and picture were displayed in the old wrong orientation. When i tab on my send pictures, they are also displayed in wrong orientation. I'm not sure if Textsecure does it wrong here, but this is the only place i discovered this strange behavior.

		Occasionally, I receive two messages over PUSH with the exact same &quot;Sent&quot; time, where the second message can't be decrypted. Further messages can be sent/received fine without restarting a secure session. I suppose that this is because a message gets duplicated somehow, but can't be decrypted because of the way keys are changed. Might be related to how the PUSH channel works.

TextSecure 2.0.3 on Android 4.4.2 (Nexus 5).

		Would it be possible to add a self destruct element to secure messages? So that you can set them to remove themselves from a recipients phone after X number of minutes/hours/days? Perhaps this could be either after it is read or after it is received. Perhaps local deletion of messages in a conversation could ask if you want the remote version removed as well.

		I think it would be nice to add our contact details (&quot;has TextSecure&quot; / &quot;is registered for Push&quot;) to the system-wide contact list, just as Threema / Telegram / WhatsApp / ... do it. Then, for a contact in my address book that has TS installed, the contact would show this piece of information in the contact screen and take me to the TS-Conversation with one tap. My usual &quot;workflow&quot; for contacting someone is: I open my address book, open his contact, and then have a look at the options I have. There I see &quot;Oh, I can contact him via SMS, WhatsApp, or Threema&quot; (for example). I do not open all my installed messengers and look around in which messenger I can contact him..

		When someone first launches the app, he quickly gets to the dialog &quot;Connect with TextSecure&quot;. That dialog asks for: your country, your country code and phone number. It would be great if: if we got rid of the &quot;country&quot; or &quot;country code&quot;. One of the 2 should be enough. these could be automatically populated so that one just needed to confirm that these were correct. I believe that Android provides a way to query for the local phone number.

		Show an AlertDialog telling the user that the message will be sent via SMS provider and might cost him cash. Show the user a toast telling him that the message he just sent was for free because the other user is also using TextSecure. Show both for the first 3 blue/green messages ever sent. I came to this idea because i have read some german feedback in the Play Store and the users are confused if their messages cost money or not.

		There is feedback in the Play Store that people are confused because they never know if the next message will be for free or not. That is especially important for photos which i bet nobody ever wants to send via MMS and pay up to $1 for that. So a dialog warning that the photo will be sent via MMS would be very helpful.

		Hi, I'm running TS on Android 4.3 (Omega Rom v56 with Boeffla Kernel 5.2Beta5 on a Samsung I9300). I've TS configured to handle secured messages only (SMS/MMS are kept apart in the stock app, ) In case internet connection (Wifi as well as mobile data) is turned off and I send a message to a contact it states &quot;sending..&quot; (green background) This is kept even when internet is enabled again. The next message becomes delivered (blue background) but not the first message which stays forever on &quot;sending..&quot; with green background. I've expected, that the message becomes delivered as soon my internet connection is up. See logcat as reference: http://hastebin.com/redatideyu regards Georg

		When TextSecure is configured to: not be the default SMS app, not use SMS fallback, it seems that when an SMS is received it shows up interleaved with the secure data-channel messages, even though it already shows up in the default SMS app. My expected behavior is that in this configuration TextSecure should be concerned with (only) messages sent and received over the data channel. Experienced on Android 4.4.2, TextSecure 2.0.3.

		TextSecure detected my number was already registered (because I used Cyanogenmod). It tells me to unregister my number there for me to continue, but I can't due to the phone not being able to run anything else than default ROM anymore. Is there any way to unregister elsewhere? Specific error message: This number is already registered on a different TextSecure server (CyanogenMod?). You must unregistering there before registering here.

		I just found the feature to manually send an unencrypted message (long press on the send icon), which I thought is what I wanted. Exept it isn't. I'm not sure what this should accomplish, so I don't know if the behaviour is a bug or if I want a new feature. This is what I want: Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection the mesage gets sent via sms the message is encrypted Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off the message gets sent via SMS the message is encrypted Case 3: I am in an encrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS the message is encrypted Case 4: I am in an unencrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted This is what I would expect from &quot;send unencrypted message&quot;: Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection the mesage gets sent via data message is not encrypted Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted Case 3: I am in an encrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted Case 4: I am in an unencrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted That's how it &quot;works&quot;, at least for me: Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection the message gets sent via data (I don't know it this should be happening) message is encrypted (this should probably not happen) Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off the message gets sent via SMS the message is not encrypted I haven't tested case 3 and 4 yet (tell me if you want me to). Is there any use in having this function? If so, could you quickly explain what it's supposed to do and why? It doesn't really help if two people write via SMS and somehow the session gets messed up - you could just go ahead and end or renew the session via the lock in the top bar. I would personally like to be able to manually force the use of SMS and several friends asked me if it's implemented already. For most of them the usecase for that looks like this: The receiver turns off wifi and mobile internet to not be disturbed by instant messages or mails while doing important work. The expectation is, If somebody really needs to contact you, they'll either call or write a text message. Many people I know use exactly this behaviour at work and others know that. So when it's working hours, the other one doesn't immediately reply to your push messages, and you have to contact them, forcing TS to send an SMS is the next best option. No need for TS to know if they are offline (#677, #678)

		Minimal investigation here, sorry. Pictures sent to an Android (non-TS) go through fine. But when sent to an IPhone user on a different carrier, she gets &quot;One or more of the message components have been deleted by MMS Adaption. Either the message was too large or the components were unsuitable for your handset.&quot; I have afterwards resent the same picture on Hangouts, and then she is able to properly receive the picture. I hope this isn't a spurious report, I don't see a good way to filter issues. Whattup, @tinloaf. Excellent work you guys are doing here. I am thinking about putting a couple hours into the TS codebase myself.

		We all heard about &quot;BlackPhone&quot; and all the buzz it generated in the media. Well - BlackPhone entirely depends on the SilentCircle suit of applications and is apart from that just... Android excl. Google Play. So it came to my mind, that a stripped down version of android in conjunction with Whisper could be ideal for people striving for maximum security. I recommend not to sell a device like BlackPhone does, but instead create something like a privacy-oriented custom rom lacking the traditional phone app and using Whisper's services instead.

		So, a friend and I had initiated a session months ago with the old TextSecure. In the interim, I broke my phone and got the new version on a new phone. He texted me, which came across as &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot;. But my trying to start a new secure session caused his TextSecure to crash. Him restarting the app and the session worked fine and there were no further issues. This is likely a bug in the old version, but was quirky enough that I thought it should be mentioned.

		Hi. I was grepping the code for weird places to confirm if I can use TextSecure as my SMS replacement. I saw that MasterSecret nulls out some buffer in its constructor where secretKey and macKey was residing. Is this because we don't want to leave some copy of the secretKey in freed memory? I guess so. But than again MasterSecret gets copied around often in Parcel I think. For each Intent.putExtra and for the single MasterSecret.parcelClone call (why?). Why aren't these copies nulled out after use? Especially because Parcel comes from a pool with no documented scope.

		Currently TS2 registration scheme depends on an mobile operator activated device to both receive a account registration SMS to create and authenticate an account on whisperpush servers. A huge host of devices (mostly tablets) don't have mobile connectivity at all or are wifi-degraded for a reason so auth via SMS is not an option. Add a manual scheme via username/password.

		The sharing of, e.g. Images, from another app or browser to a group in TextSecure is not possible. It is not possible, selecting the group. Also in this dialoug select single users about the &quot;+&quot; is not possible. The user is still not selected. It is only possible to select individual user via search. Workaround for sharing to a group would be: Images from other APPs save before in his gallery and then in TextSecure within the group insert the image about &quot;Attachment&quot;. However, this is very uncomfortable

		I communicate with some recipients who enable their mobile's data channel only sporadically. This means that messages I sent to them (via PUSH) may not be received by them for hours. IMHO, this defeats the purpose of a short message, which is supposed to be delivered instantaneously. So I wonder: Is there a way to configure TS so that it falls back to SMS delivery if PUSH doesn't succeed within a few seconds? Can I enable PUSH globally, but disable it for certain recipients?

		Hey, I've the problem that I do not recieve andy PUSH messages at all, however can write to everybody via push and the messages are delivered without any error. If I disable networking textsecure works without any problems via SMS. I'm using CM 7.2 for GT5830i, which does not contain whisperpush (as long as I know). Could it be, that the following caused this error: Installed textsecure, registered at the server for PUSH, deinstalled it 5 minutes later as there was no contact from me with textsecure, without desubscribing from push. Two days later I reinstalled textsecure, multiple times registering and deregistering at the server doesn't help, also deinstallation and reinstallation of textpush while deleting cache, and data doesn't work. If it helps I can send my mobile phone number (privately) to a dev, maybe this helps to track the issue down (if someone has access to the server).

		With the new PUSH Protocol, I believe the string: preferences__allow_sms_fallback_disabled_reason in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/values/strings.xml might be misleading. If you are not registered for push, it says TS is configured as default SMS app and this is the reason you can't disable SMS fallback. However I think the reason is because I'm not registered for push. So there could be two reasons why one can't disable SMS fallback: not registered for push or default SMS app. Maybe the string should be updated.

		I've noticed that messages I recieved last night while I was sleeping show up in the app as being recieved at 6:05am (timestamp next to the little lock icon) That's not right though, that's what time I unlocked the app to view the messages. If I examine a message sent (Long press and select Message Details) it says: Transport: PUSH Sent: Tuesday Mar 4, 2014 at 12:25:28AM Received: Tuesday Mar 4, 2014 at 06:05:25AM That doesn't seem right to me, the timestamp is when the app was unlocked, not when the messages were actually received.

		Since there's so many UX experts around lately, I want to propose this: In groups, I always find it kind of annoying to have to read the name of the sender of a message. Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a &quot;string to RGB&quot; hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

		Two of my contacts I regularly exchange messages with both have a HTC Desire S with the stock Android 2.3.5. When one of these contacts participate in a group chat, several other members of this group receive messages with invalid encryption, usually several in a row. I apologize for the approximate description of this behaviour, it's not really reproducable. Any idea on how to debug this?

		Sending a push message from user A's HTC Desire S with Android 2.3.5 to a user B with a Nexus 5 and latest Android does not work, user B just sees messages with &quot;bad encryption&quot;, both for direct messages as well as messages in a group. What's especially strange here is that user B sees both messages as direct messages...

		When someone sends me a picture over the internet connection and my WiFi connection is interrupted before the download ended than the download stops and does not restart after recovery of the WiFi connection. Even after hours I see the download symbol with the animation but nothing happens. This is really an issue that can prevent many users from changing from whatsup to Textsecure.

		When sending messages via textsecure on a mostly blocked wifi connection, the messages are delivered properly, but replies end up being queued until I change connections. At work we have wifi with almost all ports closed. I can send textsecure messages to people and they are delivered properly, but when those people reply to me, I don't get anything until I leave the office. As soon as I'm out of range of the office wifi, and my phone switches over to 3G, I get all the messages delivered at once. While this is great for not being interrupted at work, I'm not sure it's the desired behaviour. Anything I can do to help debug this, or work around it? For now, I'm just staying off my work wifi and using 3G.

		Sending a message seems to include a ssl handshake with the ts server. This expensive operation is problematic in areas with limited coverage or overloaded cells (such as in a demonstration or today's carnival). It can take minutes for a message to be sent. Receiving (via gcm) is much faster. Can we speed this up? Maybe keep the socket open for a while? Use some faster re-negotiation? Or do some crypto magic instead of ssl? :-)

		Alice starts a secure session with Bob, they exchange keys and Bob's key is correctly stored in ''Contact Keys'' as expected. In this process, Bob's phone number is received and stored as +CountycodeAreacodePhonenumber. In Alice's contact list, however, Bob's number had been stored as +Countrycode AreaCode Phonenumber, ie. the different parts are separated by spaces. It seems that the two entries are not recognized as equal by TextSecure, i.e. Bob's entry is not marked green (as a TextSecure contact). This is somewhat misleading,one work around is to edit the entry (removing the spaces) in Alice's contact list.

		Currently Reads: Secure Contacts Other contacts who are able to receive encrypted TextSecure messages are shown in the &quot;Select Contact&quot; list with a green bar to the left of their name. I am using the 'dark' theme and see no indication of whether or not my contact will support encrypted messaging on neither the main list of messages, nor the &quot;Select Contact&quot; screen after pressing the + button. I am not sure as to whether or not this is a regression bug or a difference in themes or a difference in versions. Please advise as to whether or not this copy should be changed on the Wiki.

		Can you explain somewhere when the TextSecure app decides to send a secure message? If I am sending a password to a colleague, I don't want the message ever to be sent unencrypted. The gui shows a padlock after I send a message, but by that point it is too late. If they don't have TextSecure what do they get and see? Is the message plaintext? If they do have TextSecure, but remove it, does my message get sent plaintext instead? Thanks.

		Hello, thanks for your great work. I am please you take that effort to make communication more secure to us. One enhancement (if I did not oversee the functionality) I deeply miss is the possibility to chose whether the message should be sent via mobile network or via SMS. Sometimes I do not have a data connection (or the person I communicate with) and in this case I would be happy if I could either re-send the message via SMS or if the system gave me the option to define a timer like &quot;if the message cannot be sent via data within 10 minutes do it via SMS&quot;. Thanks a lot!

		I just wrote a message to a group and lost my wifi connection. After I hit 'send', a notification popup was shown telling me that the SMS could not be delivered and that it will be sent later. The message was delivered via push eventually, but the popup obscured the screen, even after switching to another app and swiping TS from the app list. Unfortunately I did not try to force quit TS but rebooted my phone. TS 2.0.4 All recipients in the group and myself are registered for push. Here's the error log: http://hastebin.com/cufowigeje This happened once before in 2.0.0.

		Hey, I'm on 2.0.4, on JB/4.3, and the &quot;Disable SMS fallback&quot; option is always grayed out. As I've found no definitive answer on how to change the default messaging app in 4.3 I've tried toggling SMS in Hangouts, installing other SMS apps such as EvolveSMS (which says it overwrites the default behaviour), reinstalling TextSecure - all to no avail. How am I supposed to achieve being able to turn SMS fallback off?

		Hi folks, I love your app and I think that I can convince many of the people surrounding me to use it. Also I'd love to use it as a replacement of the stock sms app, but there is one open problem for me: Since I have friends abroad, sending sms to them is quite expensive. So I'd suggest to check and compare country codes of the telephone numbers and whenever they don't match textsecure should ask the user before using sms fallback... Despite of this issue, I have to say I'm impressed of your work and I highly appreciate it... (and sorry for my first post being a feature request -_-)

When I want to send a message to one of my buddys from the contact book, I have to manually type in their number/name and then select one of the suggestions made by textsecure (or completely type it in). If I try to select them from the contact book instead, textsecure won't fill in their name/number in the recipient's field. Tried it on the fairphone, galaxy s3 and samsung xcover.

		I'm using TextSecure on a Samsung Galaxy S4 Dual SIM device with two SIM cards inside. I've enabled the number of the 2nd SIM for TextSecure. It works like a charm, thank you very much. But I would appreciate one thing very much. Could you please also show the number of the recipient not only of the sender in the message details? As I have two SIM cards inside I receive the messages for both numbers in TextSecure - if setting &quot;use for all SMS / MMS&quot; is enabled. I want to receive all SMS / MMS in TextSecure but I have to know to which of the two numbers it was sent.

		When starting a new conversation (TextSecure menu &gt; &quot;+&quot;), the list of my contacts is presented (&quot;Select Contact&quot;), the TextSecure supported contacts shown with a green bar. The phone number presented in this view for each contact seems to be just the first of all phone numbers for this person listed in (and imported from) my phone's directory. Choosing one of the TS supported entries, the full list of phone numbers (home, fax, work, work fax, mobile1, mobile2 etc.) for this contact is presented for choice. (See also #1011 and #990.) Unfortunately, there is no indicator for which of these numbers (for example, in the case of more than one mobile phone number) a contact key is stored. It is also not possible to check the phone number in TextSecure &gt; Contact Keys &gt; Manage Identity Keys as only the name of the contact is shown but not the specific phone number associated with it. I would like to suggest that the TS supported phone number should be emphasized (marked by a green bullet or something similar).

		There are a lot of phones with two or more sim cards and I use one of them. I'd like to use both my numbers in TS, but it allows me to be only in two states: registered and unregistered. And it'd be good to have usual stuff default messaging application has (default sim card for sending texts or 'Always ask'). If we cannot just get it from system settings, internal option will do.

		Is this possible even with the Android Ecosystem, I don't know. All I know is a friend installed it, had a play, didn't like it and uninstalled it. But I still see them as registered for PUSH, even after a refresh. For the moment I've suggested he reinstall, deregister and then uninstall.

		When receiving an MMS sent to a group (eg. first picture of a new baby), it comes in as a &quot;Conversation&quot;, which the stock messaging app doesn't have a concept of. This change in behaviour led to some (luckily not too much!) embarrassment for my wife, and some extra money to the telcos.

		I have a group chat with several other people, including @tyll, all running TextSecure 2.0.4. He sees no group details, the list of participants is empty and he cannot leave or write a message. On his phone, messages to the group are displayed in a group thread and he can decrypt the messages. No group avatar is displayed, the name is 'unknown group'. We both can exchange direct messages just fine. Maybe this is caused by missing the initial group creation message (all particpants at that time running 2.0.3)? How can users fix this, as there is no possibility to leave this empty group? Only by abandoning that group and creating a new one?

		Hi, I'm a happy owner of a Nokia X device. I built TextSecure from source and was able to install it, but not to register it, since I naturally don't have any google account associated to the phone and no google play account. Are there plans to support the Nokia push services as well? How about Amazon devices (tablets)? Is someone working on this? If not, I might have a bit time next weekend and try to work on it, but I have to admit that I currently have no clue about TextSecure internals and I'm not an experienced Android developer.

		when i get a group message it always just shows the sender in the notification drawer instead of a combination with the group name. at your daily business you maybe don't want to tap for every update in your group discussions, but you want to answer your private chats. at the moment you can not differentiate between private and group messages at your notification drawer. this is how it looks like at the moment: and something like that would be awesome ;-)

		When a push message to a group cannot be sent immediately (eg. bad network connection) the message's background is displayed in light blue (light theme). The details for this message state that it is to be sent as MMS, which is wrong. After the message has been sent, the details are corrected to PUSH.

		When closing the Textsecure app from the default app-switcher (see screenshot) it also closes the app-switcher itself unlike if i close other apps from the app-switcher. I'm using Cyanogenmod-Version 11-20140210-SNAPSHOT-M3-mako, my TextSecure is up-to-date. Although it is not a big issue, it is annoying (might annoy others too) and i think it might lead to other errors. The following screenshot was taken right before closing Textsecure by swiping from left to right. After that, the app-switcher closes. 👍 1

		Since you mentioned in the issues about dubed phone numbers and libphonenumber that there are plans to rework the contacts view I think I should give some feedback about it. The search bar should work as in the conversations view. The profile pictures should be visible in the contacts view. To choose from more then one possible phone numbers shouldn't require a dialogue box. The view should display all available phone numbers at once. Kinda like the &quot;all contacts&quot; view in the KitKat dialler. If TextSecure isn't use as SMS replacement, the contacts view should only display TextSecure enabled numbers. TextSecure enabled contacts shouldn't be in green but in blue like TextSecure PUSH messages.

		After receiving a MMS message the top info bar only shows the sender of that MMS and the chat history for that group is shown; however, immediately drafted replies are sent as SMS only to that sender, rather than as MMS to the group. Hitting the back arrow and then re-selecting the conversation then shows it as a group conversation and replies are drafted and send as MMS. It seems like the appropriate behavior would be for the app to initially draft/send as MMS to the whole group, in this situation.

		Alice starts a conversation with Bob. She changes app to the browser and finds an image she wants to link to Bob (or any other shareable thing). She opens up the share menu and chooses TextSecure. The view at this point is a blank conversation window (no recipient) and the message prefilled. There are two issues: Alice was previously looking at Bob's conversation and it would be good to follow the convention of showing the last thing Alice saw in the app. Hangouts does this. If Alice re-enters Bob's number, the send icon is for an unsecured message, even though when Alice hits send it is in fact an encrypted message and is appended to the existing conversation. So the request is: when sharing something to TextSecure, use the existing conversation view if it exists, otherwise mirror Hangouts and allow choosing an existing recipient from the contact list.

		The bug: I deleted all my data from Textsecure while I was in a group and registered again with the same number. After that, I get the messages of the old group which is just unknown since then and I can't leave or write to this group. It's showing that there aren't any members in the group. My mates can't kick me from the group either. This is how the bug was caused: I joined a group, made an encrypted backup, deleted all data of the app, restarted it and restored the backup. The restore failed, all messages were broken. I still get messages of the group, the group is unknown, I can't leave or join the group, but receive all messages they send. Suggestion: Let me see which groups I joined with my number and let me leave them (even if I restored!) 👍 7

		i have some keys where the contact is long gone and i dont even recognize the telephone number because it isnt in my address book anymore. other people i know switched to iphone or stopped using textsecure a long time ago but their keys are still there. i dont need to keep public keys that no longer have any corresponding private keys. i should be able to manually delete keys!! this also might be useful if there is some communication error and i want to start fresh with new keys... but im just guessing.

		when i dont have a key for a contact then the lock menu does not appear when i select them with the plus sign to compose a new message so i can not initiate secure communications. i need to send them plain text then have them initiate in return. this is less efficient than letting me straight off initiate. if i know someone has textsecure on their phone then i should be able to send a key request off the bat, like i could in textsecure version 1. it is cleaner this way. if they dont have textsecure then there is a wasted request but so what? you could add something that says &quot;this user is trying to establish encrypted communications using textsecure. to communicate privately, please download textsecure from the play store.&quot; then you are promoting textsecure. i remind you are am talking about using the lock menu to manually start a secure session, not to spam everyone, that wouldnt be right. Adium for Mac OS does exactly what i am talking about with their OTR system.

		I can not see when or if a key is verified, I'm not taking lists of them I verified, so it should be very helpful to see which one is. So I could never recognize if someones key change and needs to be reverified, maybe the the verified keys could be colored and a notification at the chat windows would be required.

		Hello, I'm using Textsecure on Android and got some notification issues. For app notifications I'm using Lightflow which allows me, to set up detailled notification seeting for every single apps like color of LED, sound, vibration patterns etc. These app needs turning off every notification in a certain app except the symbol in the notification bar. And this is where my problems with Textsecure began. Textsecure doesn't allows it to turn off the LED, neither the sound, but this is neccesary for apps like Lightflow. I can choose &quot;none&quot; for the sound, but it turns to &quot;default&quot;. So it would be really nice if you can make it possible to disable every single kind of notification in Textsecure.

		It would be very nice if TextSecure could store the status of verification and show it with colors or so. The concept is implemented by Threema, where it is shown with colors and dots, how reliable the public key from a contact is. It ist described here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threema#Usability This would it make easier to understand how secure connections are and you could see which contacts are verified yet and which are outstanding.

		Would it be possible to ask the user during the first start of the app (right before/after setting the passphrase), to specify the desired behaviour: only use push use SMS fallback use as default SMS/MMS-App Probably even add a &quot;what does that mean?&quot; button which opens a pop-up that explains (in simple words) what every mode does. This would go a long way in making the app more friendly for the less tech-enthusiastic users and those, who don't want to crawl through the settings-menu. edit: corrected formatting.

		There needs to be a way of turning off Push without unregistering from server or turning mobile and WiFi off. For example, on a regular basis a use a corporate network and a university network. They are both heavily monitored and packets and protocols through them are managed and stay behind one or several proxies. This means that sometimes Push messages can't get through and I need to either go and switch off my network, which I use for other things, or switch off Push, which means I have to reregister again afterwards. I am sure there are other situations where you want to be able to just suspend Push functionality, not 'cripple' it completely. So my idea is that switching off Push and unregistering from server should be put on different buttons and be kept relatively independent of each other.

		Think its a good idea if you're able to see if a contacts key was verified (with the QR scan feature). The lock symbol in the Conversation could be colored (e. g. blue) to reflect the verified state. Even contacts could get another color (blue?) in the contact list for verified contacts. This would it make easy to see which keys are manually verified (blue -&gt; verified, green -&gt; using TextSecure but unverified). Might be also a good idea to display the date of the last manual verification in the contacts key window (where the contacts key is displayed).

		I created a secure connection between two devices. This morning I want to create a new conversation with the same person and choose unfortunately &quot;Sichere Verbindung beenden&quot; (Close secure connection). Now I'm unable to recreate a secure connection. I deleted all app-data and reinit everything but I can't get the lock-symbol again.

		I noticed that when I configure TextSecure to use the pt_BR (Brazil) localization, it actually uses the pt_PT (Portugal) localization. As an example, look at the string &quot;Language&quot; in the settings menu. pt_PT translation = &quot;Língua&quot; pt_BR translation = &quot;Idioma&quot; (but appears &quot;Língua&quot;)

		I'd really like the option to see the full timestamp on every message in a conversation. I get why the current implementation exists (time-&gt; day -&gt; date) but I'd really rather have the full timestamp shown all the time instead of having to use the message details pop-up to get the information

		Still all SMS from senders that use non-numeric sender IDs go to the Anonymous thread. (e.g. SMS from cellphoneproviders or banks or delivery services). They can't be distinguished in there, because their real sender ID is omitted. That makes TextSecure unusable as an default SMS App replacement imho. I know this is a dupe of #665, but there is a fix for that ( i.e. #693 ) and it won't get merged to the master branch, while minor fixes get pushed through. Please consider taking this fix into the next release version.

		Please sort Messages by send time, not by receive time (and show send instead of recieve time under the messages). Sometimes I have lots of problems to follow discussions in larger group chats, when I power on my phone and recieve lots of messages with the same timestamp under a message with no time break between the topics. This is a very annoying bug... 👍 1

		Earlier, I sent a message to an verified PUSH contact when I was possibly out of cell coverage, and (not sure if this is related) I restarted the phone. After this, the message is displayed in light blue with a &quot;...&quot; indicating it has not been sent and TS did not (visibly) attempt to resend the message. Message details indicate the message is to be delivered as &quot;SMS&quot; even though I have SMS fallback disabled. Sending PUSH messages after this works and they come through, the earlier message remains light blue. This is on 2.0.4 with an Android 2.3.

		What I really like about TextSecure is that I have one App to handle all my messages (SMS, MMS and Internet). But I always have a bad feeling if I send a large message because I'm never 100 percent sure that the message will be send over the network connection and not as an SMS. If this happens by accident, e.g. because the network connection is temporarily down or because I thought that the recipient also uses TectSecure but he doesn't, then it can become really expensive. It would be great if SecureText could provide a warning before sending a message as SMS. Something like &quot;Message will be send as SMS? [continue] [postpone] [cancel]&quot;. &quot;continue&quot; will send the message as SMS, &quot;cancel&quot; will cancel the action and &quot;postpone&quot; will keep the message back until the network connection becomes available again and then send it (ideally) automatically. If the recipient doesn't use TextSecure the &quot;postpone&quot; option should be hidden. What do you think about such a feature?

		Hello! I wrote this already in the bithub comment but i thought it might be better to post it here. I hope this is okay. I like you great approach to give developer a tribute by paying them. But for me &quot;as a supporter&quot; it would be cooler if I could decide for what bug/issue/feature I like to give the coins. Sure there should always be a little split (lets say for example 2% of the donation) which goes into commits for generally issues. Elementary.os, for example, took a nicer way. They choose bountysource.com (opensource) to do that (http://elementaryos.org/journal/fix-bugs-get-paid) however... everyone could decide by themselves which bug or feature are more important. Bugs which are very difficult to solve could be made more interesting for developer because of the raising money. On the other side the developer could also say an amount what he want to have to solve an issue.

		I have the following scenario: I message with a friend and everything works fine, SMS and push messages are encrypted correctly. However, when I change my SIM card (and consequently also my number) the messages sent by me over SMS can not be decrypted by my friend: Message encrypted for non-existing session... Push messages still work. Additionally, my friends messages are always sent over SMS (never over push). So the problem seems to be that my counterpart doesn't know that I am using TextSecure (or rather this new number of mine) and my TextSecure instance still encrypts messages which can not be decrypted. How can I tell TextSecure about my second number?

		If a conversation gets long (hundreds of messages, with images), TextSecure starts being very slow on my Gingerbread phone and RAM consumption can go up to 48 MB (too much for the little device). TextSecure is almost unusable in this state. Perhaps only loading the most recent messages will help?

		I registered TS for my wife and me using it as default SMS app. Exchanging encrypted push messages worked quite well. Then I switched off my data channel and sent another message. The message details show that SMS was used, but it stays with light blue color and does not get delivered. A second message sent over reenabled data channel shows PUSH, is of dark blue color and got delivered instantly. Then I sent a message to a non-TextSecure contact and this worked properly as well. It seems the SMS fallback is not working for me.

		As mentioned in #674, the drawer in the conversation list isn't really necessary in its current form. Why not put the conversation list itself in a drawer and remove the separate activity entirely? I coded a proof-of-concept branch and really like the result, but wanted to see what others' opinions are. This is a rather large change, and isn't fully polished up, so I'm not opening a pull request just yet. The branch can be found here if anyone wants to see/build it. It works quite well in its current state with just a few edge cases that need to be fixed up. Import/Export and the key fingerprint views can be found at the bottom of the settings screen for now.

		I'm using the current Google play store edition from textsecure and it is impossible to create a new contact when you receive a message from an unknown number. When you click on &quot;add new contact&quot; you can only select an existing contact. It should be possible to create a new contact. I'm using Android 4.4 with cm on a nexus 5.

		If someone else starts an MMS group chat with me, then replying to the conversation causes TextSecure to send my own message to me in addition to the intended recipients. This only occurs if someone else initiated the conversation, if I initiated it then MMS works as intended.

		If you attempt to send a message to yourself, the app prompts to initiate a key exchange. If you accept, the app will perform said key exchange with itself, but only one key is stored. All messages sent to self after this point are received as &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; Furthermore, attempting to end the secure session results in &quot;Message encrypted or non-existing session...&quot; In my opinion, messages to self should simply be stored, not sent. Disallowing messages to self is also an option, but other texting apps don't prohibit this so this could cause problems if you are importing data from, say, the default texting app.

		Text Secure appears to cause my phone to soft reboot after entering power save while it is open on-screen. It occurs about 60 seconds after the screen time-out or hitting the power button to enter power save manually. It is reproducible every time. It is the only app that does this and is fine if I jump back to the home screen first. The app is still usable as long as I remember to jump out if it. I have a HTC One XL running Telstra firmware 5.08.841.3, rooted but with standard kernel. Here is the TextSecure log: http://hastebin.com/gogojinoku I also did a logcat dump to a file then induced the problem: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24346749/logcat.txt

		A groups invitation system will be a very welcome addition to the existing features. Basically, if someone adds me to a group, I would like an invite asking me if I want to accept or deny joining that group. All invitations can be collected in a separate screen where they can wait for my confirmations. I know I can always leave a group if I don't want to be on it, but this way, I have control about which groups I join right from the beginning, instead of being dumped into it. Thanks for the awesome app. :)

		I'm running CM 10.1.0 on Samsung GT-I8150 (Galaxy W) with v2.0.4 from the Google Play Store and can't register for the PushService. TextSecure gives a network/connection error. I tried 3G and WiFi, deleted user data+cache, reinstalled TS and disabled privacy without any success :-( See screenshots on https://www.wuala.co...blic/TextSecure On my girlfriend's stock rom (Sony Xperia mini 2.3.6) TextSecure can register for the push service without any problems. I can provide logfiles if usfull. See also http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/87365-whisperpush-registration-fails-connectivity-error/page__gopid__451519#entry451519

		Dear @moxie0, as much as I enjoy using TextSecure as a complete replacement for the standard SMS app, I am not happy with the registration process for the Push-Service of TextSecure. To be specific, I am running AOKP and TextSecure tells me that registering with the Push-Service is not possible without having the Google PlayStore-App installed. To be very clear about this: Google Play will NEVER EVER gain permission to land on my phone. The way I see it, being required to install Google Play (in my eyes one of the most dangerous privacy-breaking apps out there) just to be able to use the Push-Service of TextSecure (which focuses on PRIVACY) is like a snake biting its own tail. I guess TextSecure utiltizes Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), and as such Google Play is &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;, am I right? Don't get me wrong: Using TextSecure feels awesome. It just does feel that way leaving WhatsApp behind and knowing that TextSecure is being recommended by The Guardian Project and can be safely relied on to protect my data. But having to have Google Play just feels wrong. My intention is to DITCH Google completely (except for Android Custom ROMs) in the long run, not creating yet another tie for myself. So why don't we make an effort to find an alternative for this crappy Google Cloud Messaging?

		Hey there, I've installed TextSecure, I am able to send messages (via Push) but I didn't receive any. I've set TextSecure as standard messaging app and the phone is running 4.4.2. What else do you need to know? Since I changed back to standard messaging app everything works fine...

		I saw the following problem on two different Motorola Moto G devices: Sending messages to another TS user via push works well. TS crashes every time you try to send a normal, unencrypted SMS to a recipient without TS. The problem only seems to occur when the system's default SMS app is disabled. But I wonder why that is, because on my phone (GNexus) TS works just fine with a disabled SMS app. Here's the logcat: --------- beginning of /dev/log/main

 I guess the problem is that on the Moto G, divideMessage(...) calls the default SMS app which is of course not available once it is deactivated. But maybe it is possible to display a better error message instead of just crashing?

		When I send a push message while not having a data connection (e.g. by manually disabling data and wifi) and sms fallback disabled, these messages are displayed with a light blue background (light theme) as if the message is about to be sent. No error is displayed and the message is not detected as failed-to-send. When data connection returns, the messages are still displayed in the same state, without the option to resend them. Is that a bug or a feature? ;) The message details state that the message is to be sent via SMS. The only option is to manually copy and paste the text and send it again when the data connection returns.

		For some reason when someone initiates a thread with a group and I am part of it, whenever I respond it sends myself a text message as well. So I see the sent item and then it is actually going out and sending myself a text message. From then on in that thread it will continue to do so unless I make a new group and send to it.

		TextSecure doesn't make it clear when it is sending messages as SMS or as internet messages. I think this is an important issue, considering that some countries have bad mobile connections that tend to fail from time to time, what can make a long chat increase the cost involved on it

		I don't know if it's possible, but how about integrating Hangouts support just to further reducing of messaging apps to use. By now I am using the following messaging apps: Whatsapp (just for some groups) SMS + secure messaging with TextSecure Hangouts (I like the possibility to use it with Miranda IM on my computer, because I don't like browser chatting and additional IM software) To reduce (and combine messaging Threads) to one messaging application it would be graet to have Hangouts included into TextSecure. On the other hand we are losing a reason to change to TextSecure for people not yet switched. Not everyone is really interested in encryption, but is interested in using the same app everyone else does. btw: afaik ChatSecure is always using Hangouts channel, so it seems to be possible to include it.

		Hi, I have used Textsecure in the past. Now i have switched to CM 11 and enabled Whisperpush (unregistered push from Textsecure, registered Whisperpush) So, when I send now a message from a second phone with Textsecure to my phone with Whisperpush there seems to be a problem. Phone 2 sends a encrypted message to my phone via network(push). Message gets send. My phone never receives the message. There is no message, no indication, simply nothing. Is this a known problem?

		I switched from WhiserPush (within CyanogenMod) to TextSecure. Therefore I had to get a new key. I tried (without success) to send a picture to recipient A. After I realized, I had to register &quot;again&quot; to get a new key to get everything running, I send another picture to recipient B. The thumbnail showing is the picture I send to recipient A some days ago. When I open the thumbnail, TextSecure shows the correct picture, I really sent to recipient B. After that, the error never occurred again, but I think that is kind of strange and worth reporting.

		The MMS group fix has worked well. However, I have discovered new issues on my xperia z1s with 4.3. The app will randomly hang and force close. I have tried to replicate the behaviour and have not found a single trigger. It happens 3-4 times a day. Additionally, with the force closes, I have to input my passphrase a lot more frequently. A second issue I ran into is force closes when trying to export plaintext backups. The process will begin, and roughly 2 seconds after initiation, the app stops responding and is force-closed.

		Problem: I'm sending a message via data channel, but the recipient is offline, so he/she cannot receive the message. But let's assume receiving SMS would be possible. Furthermore I have no information if the message was received. -Is it possible to get a delivery-acknowledgement when data-channel is used ? -Is it possible to force SMS fallback in this case?

		I'd like an option in TextSecure for setting a repeat timer for notifications as long as I have unread messages. The setting could be once/2/10. So if I set it to 2 TextSecure will notify me every two minutes as long as I have an unread message. (Once = no repeat, 10 = every 10 minutes)

		Hello moxie, could you please let us delete the contact keys? Several of my friends changed their number or uninstalled TextSecure, I'm not liking to scroll threw their contact keys whenever I check them. Let us long press them for deleting, add a warning and everything would be fine.

		Hi, I meant not to be crude with the title, just direct. As it is now, if you want to use the data/IM channel you have to associate TextSecure with your mobile number. I realize that &quot;data channel&quot; refers to mobile data plan, which of course should require a phone number, but if userperson wishes to use TextSecure over wifi purely as an IM, it is bizarre to ask for phone number verification. So, at this point I'd like to suggest a &quot;wifi only&quot; option at hangin' out with the setup wizard time, wherein no number is asked for. Shouldn't IM over wifi, which has no technical need for a number, be the option that does not request it for setup? Obviously mobile communication must; but wifi has no justifiable reason to. I hope that requesting a number isn't considered an &quot;anti-abuse&quot; measure, as if users who have accounts with telcos are sweet little darlings who'd nary hurt a fly, but wifi users are criminals from the wrong side of the tracks; Telegram seems to do this too, it sucks. If it's just about spam accounts, there are many ways to demand &quot;proof of work&quot; from a user. To use someone's account with a telco to verify that they are an actual individual sort of flies in the face of the modern countersurveillance movement. Thanks for your excellent work, thanks for the new IM feature which is awesome, and thanks for reading.

		Since there is no issue for this yet and it has popped up across several other issues, we should discuss this. I think that &quot;data&quot; would be a good replacement in the U.S. language. In the U.S., people explicitly pay for &quot;data&quot;, so they know what that is. In German for example, this should be translated with &quot;Internet&quot;, though, since no one here would use the word &quot;Daten&quot; for mobile internet. So I guess this is at least partly language-dependent.

		I ran into an issue today as Internet connectivity is not always present where I am. Sending a message to another textsecure user the message was sent by push as that is the default. I can only assume that the receiver was without Internet connection which means that the message wouldn't arrive until they connected to Internet again (I assume?). Wouldn't it be better if textsecure attempted to use push and got a notification if the message was read. If the message was not read by the recipient within a predefined timeout then textsecure could resend the same message by sms. I can imagine quite a few users getting put off by this behavior as it is now, as they expect the message to arrive even if the receiver does not have Internet coverage. If this is covered elsewhere or there is already a solution to this I apologize.

Currently it seems as though updating a group (the title or by adding another member) deletes the image that was set for the group, unless I specifically select the same image again.

		Alice is in Ireland. Bob is in Colombia. Carol is in the UK. They resolve to use Text Secure because SMS is too expensive. They all appear to register their numbers successfully, and all of them successfully begin to use push messages. Alice (or Carol) start a new group and add the others. Alice can see both Bob's and Carol's messages, and can send messages to the group, which appear to be sent. Bob can see both Alice's and Carol's messages, and can send messages to the group, which appear to be sent. Carol can see Alice's messages, but cannot see Bob's messages, and whenever she sends messages to the group, they appear to be sent. They try to message each other individually. Alice can message both Bob and Carol. Carol can message both Bob and Alice. Bob can message Alice, but cannot message Carol. His messages don't arrive, even though they appear to have sent. None of them really understand what could be going wrong at the protocol level.

 also, this seems somewhat strange to me: description += org.whispersystems.textsecure.util.Util.join(members, &quot;, &quot;) + &quot; joined the group.&quot;;
 there is no loop around it, so why use += ? a fqn name is used to call the method, instead of using an import

		When I try to verify my number, i.e. activate the &quot;Push messages&quot; point in the settings menu, the app crashes. I apparently receive the confirmation message just fine, but once the app reaches the &quot;registering&quot; stage, it crashes (&quot;Unfortunately, TextSecure has stopped.&quot;) and takes me back to the app's main screen, i.e. the list of conversations. App was updated from an older version without the push feature (i.e. text messages only). Uninstalling and re-installing works, but obviously makes me lose my identity keys.

		On my SGS 4 i9505 running CM 11 M3, newest TextSecure (2.0.5), I do not receive any push messages via TextSecure anymore. Sending out push messages are not problem. Whenever people start a new secure session, it seems to work for them but when I answer the messages are not readable &quot;encryption problem&quot;. When I restart the session, everything works fine for them and then they can read what I write again. It has worked before and &quot;just&quot; stopped about a week ago. I have tried both over GSM and wireless, with multiple users - no change. I can send messages to anyone, but receive none myself. Here is my log: http://hastebin.com/jatedulenu As it is very long and I have no clue what's important, I do not copy it all in here. If it expires, I'll be happy to create a new one and paste it here. Let me know if you need any more information!

			<description>
		I. Introduction Currently near consensus has been reached in these issues about implementing a visual security model in TS: #910, #945, #766 and #741. In my oppinion this model has some problems which I'd like discuss here and propose a different model. I created this issue because right now there is no chance to change the course of the discussion in the mentioned issues. So I chose to not interfere any further, let the participants improve their model and work on an alternative model separately. II. Criticism of the proposed model This is the visual model as proposed in the aforementioned issues. Contact list I had to make this up myself based on #741. And yes, this has been done with MS Paint: Messaging window Message history As far as I know this is still missing, at least I didn't find a specific issue about it and therefore didn't find any screenshots. Discussion There is no coherent visual security schema for TS. We need one schema for all these three areas in TS: contact list, message history, messaging window. Too much information and too much redundancy which leads to a cluttered and less usable interface. There is no &quot;security at one glance&quot;. The icons under each message are too small. Visually impaired people might not even notice them. Those symbols don't increase with the chosen text size. Also, depending on the colour, the icons under each message are hard to read because the contrast is too low. Another issue with those icons is that there could be issues on smaller screens with less dpi. The lock symbol used on the contact list doesn't visualize the idea of three security levels well enough. Threema's indicator does so by telling the user that there are three levels and contrasting it with how many he already has achieved. I think this schema also presents an incentive to gain better security which the uni-coloured lock symbol doesn't. III. The alternative model I have used Threema's dots to implement the security indicator but I have also &quot;designed&quot; some other possible indicators (see below). Maybe it's not even possible to use Threema's dots due to legal reasons. This is only an example. Bear with me, I really don't know my way around a real graphics program so this is all done with MS Paint... ;) Contact list Messaging window Message history Short explanation of how this model works: First of: Threema doesn't use SMS, so TS has an enhanced model and more use cases. Level 1 (red): The user is communicating via SMS. It doesn't matter if the number of his contact is already in his contact list. As far as I know, SMS can be easily fabricated so it doesn't even matter if the user receives encrypted SMS, because the other party could be anybody, at least as long as there has been no verification of keys. So whether the user is communicationg via encrypted or unencrypted SMS, with the number in his address book or not, doesn't matter. The only possibility to communicate securely over SMS is to use TS with a verified contact, which would result in a green indicator. Level 2 (orange): This is for push messages that come from contacts in the usuer's address book which are not yet verified. Encryption is being used. EDIT: We should award SMS an orange indicator if there have been previous push messages and we already know that the key is connected to that number. In the case where a SMS reaches our phone from somebody unknown to us, this SMS will still have a red indicator. Level 3 (green): The user has verified the contact from his contact list and uses encryption. Discussion: Only one message colour for everything. Message colour doesn't resemble security any more, only the security indicator does. The message colour can be any colour we choose and it should be customizable in the future anyway. Though the colour should probably not be the green, orange or red of the security indicator so that people don't get confused. Also we need better contrast with the timestamp. The user can understand the security level with one glance at the security indicator. No locks, no verification badges and no transport symbols under the messages. No tiny symbols, that can't be ready by visually impaired people or won't be displayed correctly on lew-res screens. Colour-vision impaired people can still see which security level is being used. This leaves more room for what the user actually wants: communicating. I think we are too much in his face, constantly displaying something. Under each message there will only be a timestamp. I think there should be a warning message if a contact with two numbers (one of them isn't registered with TS) talks to the user and the security changes. Only switching to a red indicator probably doesn't cut it. Again, the indicator always tells you the security of your next message. If you want to know the security of your last messages, you will have to tap and hold on a message so that you can access message details. Not displaying transportation under each message might be unwise, because users who pay for SMS or Data depending on usage really want to know what TS is doing. I think the solution to this is asking the user at first start how TS should handle this. As far as I know this will be or already has been integrated into TS so we probably don't have to worry about it that much. This means either TS is not allowed to act in a way that would cost the user money or TS will ask the user what to do. The way of transportation will always be in sight, though, because the text in the message composing area will always display whether the next message will be a SMS or push message. The only thing that I would wish somebody would add is that I could allow TS to use SMS for 15min, a few hours or a day, but ask me again once this time is over. The paperlane doesn't have a lock anymore either. IV. Some ideas for security indicators This indicator needs to convey three levels of security and the user should always get the idea that more is better. Again, purely MS paint. This is taken from Google Chrome: This is the modified TS icon: Can anybody think of more? V. Conclusion Ok, this is the model I wanted to propose. Feedback is very welcome. It would also help a lot if somebody could just make new, more professional looking mockups of the screenshots.

		To improve the usability, the thumbnail dialogs (open and save) should contain a &quot;Don't show again&quot; checkbox so that the user isn't bothered again. The idea is, that the user understands that there might be a little risk in opening or saving an attached image, but doesn't want to see this warning again and again. Most users expect that the image instantly shows up. So it is nice to have this warning message, but there should be the possibility to disable it.

		It'd be nice to be able to identify people by something other than a phone number. Not all my contexts have a phone number, or at least not one I know, but do have an email address, for example. Phone numbers are generally considered more sensitive than email addresses, and have the nice property that it is easy to have many of them, among others. This might also be an opportunity to think about fallbacks other than SMS, such as email.

		Trying to switch family members from WhatApps -- bummer: I get their messages, and I can send off messages to them, but they do not get my messages. I remember when setting up the app on their phones I did not set a password to protect the local message base, but I did so when setting up the app on my phone. Probably more important difference is that I am on a Dual-SIM Huawei (with second SIM currently switched off though) while their Samsung phones are all single-SIM. So far, I have tested only on wlan (yes, when setting up TextSecure on all phones, I &quot;registered&quot; the phone no of the active SIM card, so all phones should be able to use wlan, not just SMS). Any idea what I could do so they get my messages? Thank you! -mgkai

		Hi, I had to restore TextSecure from a encrypted backup but experienced two issues: you cannot import a previous backup if you don´t create a new key. It always says the textsecure-password is invalid. A workaround is to create a dummy key (123456789) import your encrypted backup and reboot the phone. After the successful import of the backup I´ve noticed that my key has changed!!! Any of my contacts who had my key before the backup cannot decrypt my messages anymore. IMHO this needs a quick fix as it breaks all previously established communications with your contacts

		I had problems with connection to GCM and didn't recognize this. All conntects that sent messages to me, thought I got them and all works fine. It would be great, if there were a visualisation, that shows the status of the message. Maybe: sending, server received message, client (contect) received message, (optional) contect has read message. With such a status I have not to wait for an answer to a message that is never received by the other part.

		When changing the image of a group, basicly nothing happens. In the group editing activity, after selecting an image, it doesn't appear in the preview at the top left. After saving, an &quot;Updated the group&quot; message is generated, but the placeholder image is still there. Device: Nexus 4 with CyanogenMod 11 (KitKat)

		As I had some issue with registering for push service I removed TextSecure and performed a fresh install. To save my account I exported an encrypted backup right before uninstalling. At re-importing the backup up file I was asked for the password of the backed up account as I had expected. On several attempts I got the message &quot;Incorrect password&quot; although I'm absolutely sure that the password was correct as I had entered it only some minutes ago. Unfortunately I cannot provide and debug log as I with the seemingly incorrect password I could not enter TextSecure and therefore had to reinstall it another time.

		Ok, this is a bit weird: Today I noticed that I couldn't receive SMS any more. TS did not show them at all. No notification, not in the conversation, just not there. But since I have a Pebble smartwatch which shows incoming messages as well, I still got the notification on my watch. So it seems to have reached the phone, but did not get processed by TS. What happened? Titanium Backup set itself to be the default SMS app and I had no idea about that. And I still don't know why it did that because I haven't used it for days. The system SMS app handles this quite well by displaying a big warning dialog that TitaniumBackup is now the default messaging app, but TS kept quiet so I almost missed some important messages, I only received them because of my Pebble smartwatch. Now I know that TS will still work without SMS, so it should not display such an extreme warning message, but I think it would be nice to display it at least once, like &quot;You just changed your default SMS app to be TitaniumBackup instead of TextSecure. Was this intentional or should TS be the default again? &quot;It's alright&quot; / &quot;Make TS my default again&quot;&quot;.

		In many instances, after receiving a new message notification (with correct icon/notification), Textsecure will not present any further notifications/icons in the status bar/section, although the &quot;message received&quot; sound plays correctly.

		Hey, first of all thank you very much for your effort of developing such a great app! For my installation of TextSecure (2.0.5 on Android 4.3) it seems that the on/off-Switch to override system MMS settings does not work. Speaking for my particular case: if I enter the &quot;MMS Preferences&quot; Section the checkbox is checked. I may uncheck the box and return to the main menu. If I then go to &quot;MMS Preferences&quot; again, the checkbox is still checked (so it seems as if the change was not saved). In addition, I may not uncheck the checkbox again but reveice the following notification instead: &quot;Manual MMS settings are required for your phone.&quot; If I return to the main menu AGAIN and go to the &quot;MMS Preferences&quot; Section again, I may uncheck the checkbox... still, it does not seem to be the case that my changes are saved. Sidenote: changing the MMSC URL, MMS Proxy Host and MMS Proxy Port seems to work - at least the values entered are still there once I re-enter the section. Thanks for your support - I hope my description is precise enough to be of help.

		The stock rom shows the number of messages per thread (user/group). This is a nice feature and should easily be integrated as the message count is passed to a variable in ConversationListItem.java already. here my simple example: not the nice light gray smaller number like the stock sms app... Another wessenger shows the number of unread messages instead which also is a fine feature

		When I receive a group text and I reply, the message is also automatically sent back to me as well. Maybe there is a reason for inclusion, but would it be possible (and intelligent) to automatically remove one's own phone number when sending out a group message?

		Group messaging has been greatly improved in recent versions and I'm very grateful. I'm having one outstanding issue with the most recent version of textsecure. When I receive a group message, if I open it directly from the notification pulldown textsecure crashes and I need to restart it and re-enter my password. If I open the message from the main textsecure interface it doesn't crash though. Device is a Samsung Galaxy S4.

		This is just a tiny problem, but I guess I can't open half a ticket, so here it goes: When searching for app, you get some suggestions and usually they are pretty spot on, so you don't even have to click search. When searching for TextSecure with a phone localized to German, you get the suggestion &quot;TextSecure Privaten Messenger&quot;, which contains a typo. The correct phrase would be &quot;TextSecure Privater Messenger&quot;, which is already the title of the app. I don't know if play is caching an old and wrong version of the title, or if you can influence this phrase in any way. I just wanted to let you know that it'd be nice if we could fix it. It doesn't seem to be a local caching problem tough. I deleted the cache and all safed data of the play store app, but still got the same result.

		Hello, I have broken my old phone and now want to use textsecure with the new one but it won't let me, saying that my number is already in use with the broken phone, and asks to uninstall (which is impossible, as the phone is broken). FAQ says that I could generate new keys, but it was a no go. What can I do?

		Long press on a message containing a link / phone number. Click &quot;forward&quot;. Actual result - uses the text from the most recent message - not the one that I have selected. Expected result - use the message I have selected. Take this example: If I long press on &quot;Join LOL Chat&quot; and select &quot;forward&quot; TextSecure uses the message text from the last SMS (&quot;DFS&quot;). The same happens if I try to select &quot;Opera Thursdays&quot; - the &quot;DFS&quot; message is the one which is forwarded. This happens whether I'm the recipient or whether I'm the sender. If I send a message saying &quot;Alice's phone number is +447700900289&quot; I am then unable to select that message for forwarding if there is another message sent or received after it. Hope that makes sense. I just want the message I long press to be the one which gets forwarded :-)

		So I was just replying to a straight SMS and the conversation window was full of messages. After hitting the &quot;send&quot; button, I was wondering whether I made a mistake because I couldn't see the message I just sent. Turns out that it was there, just hidden as I needed to scroll down to see it. I was a bit confusing. Would it be possible to automatically scroll down in this situation so the newly sent message shows up right away?

			<description>
		I am currently using TextSecure as my default SMS application but I wish I could divide my texts with sensitive data from my everyday texts. It is silly that I have to enter my secure password just to ask my friend &quot;what's up?&quot;, and if I leave my password cached after that then my sensitive texts are just as vulnerable as any other. I suggest that we partition the texts into two parts. The normal texts can be sent and received without requiring any passphrase, just like any other SMS client. But one must enter the passphrase before security keys are exchanged. Then that part of the conversation gets encrypted and set apart, only visible when the passphrase is entered. Has something like this been suggested by anybody else? I couldn't find it.

		After reinstalling my phone (changed to cyanogen), and restoring TextSecure from a backup (Helium Backup, not TS builtin backup) I could not receive any pushed Messages in TextSecure (SMS worked, though). A friend of mine suggested, that my &quot;GCM-ID&quot; changed due to the new OS. I deactivated and activated &quot;Push messages&quot; the registration process started anew and I can receive messages again. Sadly a new key was generated, so I now have to compare keys with all my contacts again. As generating a new key does not seem necessary in this particular situation, the user should be asked if he wants to generate a new key if a key already exists. // Updated with correct terms

		When you want to invite a contact, which has more than one mobile number to a group, you have to select one of his numbers, but there is no hint, which of the contacts numbers is registered with TextSecure. There is only a warning (MMS-group), if the other number is selected. TextSecure should give a hint, maybe a little lock symbol, to show which of the contacts numbers supports push messages.

		I need the option to choose whether i want to send the msg via sms/short message or push, because sometimes it's more important to deliver a msg quickly. i.e. i know a recipient has no mobile dataplan and will onl get my msg when he connects to his home wifi late in the evening. right now, when i need to contact him quickly, i don't have any option then to go in the settings, disable push transport, send the msg, and turn it on again. besides that, you're doing an awsome job ! greetings, varac

You should get a compose window with no name, and when you try to send, it will give the unhelpful error message, &quot;Recipient is not a valid SMS or email address&quot;.

		Hi! I just started using Textsecure today, and i seem to be unable to join groups. When i get invited by someone, i dont even see it, but the other persons see a &quot;Gaspodeaz left the group&quot; message. If i create a group, the other people still get the message that i left the group, and i dont receive any of their Messages. However, if i send a message, it seems as if my phone joins the group, sends the message, and leaves the group again. Any ideas?

		Situation: I want to share a picture from an application. The next step is to select the recipients. I am able to enter a contact name or phone number into the field and select the correct entry, but the &quot;plus&quot; symbol doesn't work. I select &quot;plus&quot;, tick the checkbox beside one of my contacts and select that I'm done. The result is that the address field is empty and no contact was selected. This happens in the official APK of v2.0.5.

		Using the latest TextSecure on Android, sending regular SMSs works. However, sending and receiving push messages to and from the one friend that also has TextSecure does not work. What might be relevant is that I do not have a permanent data connection (only when I have WiFi). When she installed TextSecure, added her address book and sent me the first message, I was there with her but was not connected. We have, however, tried sending messages when both of us were connected, and they did not arrive either.

		I've been using the newest version of TextSecure on my Wildfire S and exported an encrypted backup to the SD before flashing CM 10.1. On the new system with the same version of TextSecure I was able to import the backup, but after entereing my password I can only see the different conversations with the names of the respective contacts, all the actual messages turned into &quot;Error decrypting message.&quot;. Same thing happened after reinstalling the app and trying again. Is there anything I can do to get the messages back? So far I couldn't find anything regarding this issue. Thanks in advance

		I think it would be useful to have a known (main) issues list. This would help to avoid headache if you try something that is known to be broken (sharing function) specially for new users (an the ones who are too lazy to search...) to avoid duplicate issues to show if someone is working on a fix (bad encrypted...) and reduce replies like &quot;@some_sample_body is working on that in brach XXX&quot; to show if something won't be changed (cropped contact photos ;-) ) Also have that list in play store? Maybe combined with a minimal road map showing the priority and planned fixes Is it possible to make an issue sticky or sth. like that?

		I have configured my TextSecure client so that it only sends msges via push when possible. When a friend of mine was abroad and he had roaming activated it came to the following incident: He sent me a regular SMS, I answered him with a push message, but he did not have his data connection activated while roaming. So he received the message a day later when he was back home. I had no way to realize he had not received the message on time, it tells &quot;Sunday&quot; on my client and &quot;Monday&quot; on his client.

		Hi, I am using HTC One S running CM 11 (Android 4.4.2) and cannot receive PUSH messages. WhisperPush is off in CM Settings and I am registered with the TS servers. I can send PUSH messages no problem and my friends receive them, but when they send me PUSH msg nothing happens. I have reinstalled and re-registered and there is no change. SMS works no problem, though. Any suggestions? Thanks

		I convinced a friend to start using TextSecure. This is what happened: I sent messages (SMS) with TextSecure. My friend installed TextSecure. I saw the key icon from my friend. I saw the key icon from myself sent to my friend I sent a few additional messages (the lock icon appeared, but still using SMS) I received a few messages (encrypted, via push) But now I cannot send messages anymore. The failed messages have an exclamation mark icon next to them. The details state: transport: SMS which look incorrect to me. Resending the messages gives the same problem. A log is uploaded to: http://hastebin.com/rokiwesufo Let me know if you need more details.

		http://www.hastebin.com/vomucoresi I received 2x MMS today and when I went into TextSecure, the MMS were nowhere to be seen. I searched for the the people that sent the MMS' to me and went into the message thread and downloaded and viewed the message. Once I went back out of the thread to my messages list, TextSecure then moved the senders names to the top of my messages list. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (SM-N9005), with Optus Australia firmware (not rooted Android version 4.3). By the way, thanks for an overall awesome product.

		When I get a text or use a direct message shortcut widget, a new conversation with the contact is opened. Over time this leads to multiple running conversations with the same contact, which makes the app a little sluggish. I can close running conversations by pressing the back button repeatedly. Is this behavior intended?

			<description>
		If a user (like me) has to re-install TS, restore some (old) backup or loses (part of) his data for some other reason, groups are messed up. The groups that he joined do not show up, and as far as I can see, there is currently no way to restore them. If someone tries to re-add me to the group, that does nothing. If someone writes something into the group, I see a message in an &quot;unknown group&quot;, but cannot reply since my TS does not know the recipients. I think there should be some way to send the group data from one TS that still knows this information to the one that lost it. This is what I think could be done (let my buddy be called 'Bob'): I restore a backup, my group is gone. Bob sends something in that group. My TS sees that it's missing a group, and that Bob is most probably part of it. It sends a &quot;please give me the group data&quot; message to Bob. Bob's TS receives the message and checks that I am actually part of that group (so we don't leak group data to potential outsiders). It then sends a message with the whole group information to me. Also, there should be a way to do this manually from Bob's client. @moxie0 Since you're thinking about adding message types anyway (talking about delivery receipts), could this be done?

		My friend today had an issue when he installed textsecure for the first time. He had my number saved in his addressbook without the country code. (By the way, he is in a different country than me now). So thats why he didn't see me as a push contact, although i could send him messages. After updating my contact details in the addressbook he saw that i was having textsecure, but the conversation recipients weren't updated so that still he could not send me messages. even creating a new contact with the correct country code didn't help. In the end he ended up re-installing textsecure which finally worked. I hope that this is not a duplicate bug (i didn't find it yet, though I've only searched the first two pages) and i hope that the above text is not too confusing... zaibotw

		Quite often, I receive messages with a significant delay. In the message details of received messages the sent and received time are present. I would like to have an indication in the message how long it took between sending and receiving. Maybe this could be done by a colour coded hour glass icon in the received messages, e.g. yellow hour glass: delay between 10 seconds and 1 minute, red hour glass: delay more than 1 minute. I would like to have this in order to anticipate to the sender who might have expected me to reply earlier to the message.

		Unfortunately SMS messages can't be imported, when the sender have no phone number. However, in the standard Android App are messages included, where the phone number is the name of the company. For example my bank sends SMS messages with the number &quot;comdirect&quot; and there are many more companies like that. Is there any reason, why this messages can't be imported? I really want to use TextSeure, but I also don't wanna lose my existing SMS messages.

		Some of my friends to complain about TextSecure, because some messages get wrong decrypted after a period of time, mostly a day. The messages were fine when we sent them to each other. I'm using TextSecure in german, so the error is: &quot;Fehlerhaft verschlüsselte Nachricht...&quot; We have this problem every day. It seems that it's just happening to contacts who don't use a password for TextSecure, could this please get fixed?

		When the new converstation button in TextSecure is used, a list of contacts which are in the phone's address book is displayed. When contacts in the phone's address book are known to use TextSecure, they are highlighted with green color and sorted on top of the remaining contacts. This however does not happen if the contacts are stored in the address book with a particular formatting. Different legal representations of a sample german phone number are given below: (1) +491701234567 (2) 00491701234567 (3) 01701234567 All those numbers are legal formatting options and work with TextSecure to receive and send messages. If a number is saved in the address book using option (2), TextSecure however refuses to detect that the user has TextSecure installed. A correct highlighting is therefore not provided.

How did this thing happen?

		TextSecure 2.0.5 Samsung SGH-T889 Android 4.1.2 Kernel 3.0.31-935627 Build JZ054k.T889UVBMD1 Rooted Noted that the Google Hangouts app is configured at install to send/rcv SMS and MMS messages. After installing it I was getting notifications and able to read SMS messages on TextSecure, the native messaging app in my android device, and google hangouts at the same time. Each time a SMS came in all three lit up. It is possible to disable this in the configuration of the google hangouts configuration, but it does this by default on install. I am unaware of the implications of this, if any, to TextSecure, but I thought I would bring it up to see if there was an awareness of it and if it has been addressed. I have not done extensive testing on this.

		TextSecure was able to receive MMS on the old version with these settings: http://mmsc.vmobl.com:8088/mms? 205.239.233.136 81 Also tried :8080. With the new version, trying to receive an MMS, I get the message: Error connecting to MMS provider. Same message if I disable the override and let it use system settings. I do note, it's cool how it tries wi-fi first, then 3G. Nicely done. Sorry to bring up MMS yet again... this is on a freshly reset Samsung Galaxy Ring, rooted, Android 4.1.2. Any ideas offhand?

		Alice sends a push message to Bob. She does not get an error message so assumes it has been delivered. Bob does not receive any message. He has restored his phone from backup and everything else works, so why care? Both sync their contact list. Bob sends a push message to Alice. It is delivered correctly. Alice turns off data and sends an encrypted SMS message to Bob. It is delivered and readable. Alice and Bob compare keys. They match. Alice checks the debug log. It mentions that the message was not sent because Bob is not registered to the server. Bob un-registers and re-registers his phone. New keys are generated. Both sync their contact list again. Now push is working from Alice to Bob and vice versa. Questions: Why didn't Alice get a warning message when she tried to send a push message? Why wouldn't TS be able to receive push messages after restoring the phone from backup with all settings (Nandroid backup), but sending push messages works fine? Unfortunately I didn't save the stack trace, it was overwritten with subsequent attempts to resolve the problem. (Related to issue #678 but not a duplicate)

		After a conversation partner got a new phone and reinstalled TextSecure we could not establish a secure connection anymore. I disabled TextSecure (default for SMS, MMS, Push in preferences) and enabled it again. Since then secure communication via SMS works again. But i can't enable Push anymore. I get an &quot;SMS verification failed&quot; error. The number is correct. I tried different networks. Firewall and Privacy Guard are disabled / uninstalled. After several tries i tried registering WhisperPush. It worked immediately on the same phone. Meanwhile i manually unregistered from WhisperPush again. Any ideas?

		Hello, I have an issue with TextSecure. It seems to send messages fine, but no texts I receive are loaded into the database. I also had this problem with the SMS verification when I registered my phone number, the text was received, but TextSecture didn't recognise it. I had the same issue with RedPhone. Now when I receive a text, to load it into TextSecure I have to import it from the database, but Go SMS Pro and stock Messaging receive messages just fine. Not sure if I can receive encrypted messages yet since I don't know if I have any contacts who also use it. Not sure what I can do to test this... but I am happy to help test it out. Phone: Samsung Galaxy GT-I9305 Android: CyanogenMod-10.1.3-i9305

			<description>
		(This might be an Android bug, not a TS bug but I've only seen it with TS) I have the latest Play store release of TS installed and have it configured as my default SMS app. I had TS import the existing message store and everything shows up in TS just fine. The app also appears to send and receive both SMS and MMS just fine for me. However, I noticed that if I send an SMS outside of TS, the message isn't shown inside TS (I assume because it writes to the default message store and not TS's). Example: if I use Google Now and say 'ok google, text my wife' and send her a text through this mechanism, the message is sent and the little card that pops up saying it was sent shows TS as the default messaging app and opens TS when you click it but the message I just sent is not shown in TS. If I make Hangouts the default app again temporarily then I see the message no problem. I also have an app called Agent that detects when I'm driving and responds to incoming SMS with an SMS of its own saying that I'm driving and that I'll contact them later. These messages also do not show up in TS, but become visible when I switch back to Hangouts. It would appear that TS uses its own message store for all messages and does not synchronize with the default Android message store after the initial import. I seem to recall another issue here on GitHub where someone was asking for an unencrypted message store and an encrypted one and after thinking about it, I think if TS would use the default message store for &quot;normal&quot; unencrypted SMS/MMS then that would solve both that request and the issue present here. I understand that makes the codebase more difficult though as there are two code paths accessing two different message stores.. Is my assessment of why the messages are not shown in TS correct? Is this by design? Can we rectify this? I just know that if I'd convinced my wife to use TS as her default app and then she couldn't find a message that she sent she'd never trust TS and would uninstall it in a heartbeat. If we're going to 'sell' our friends on TS as a 'drop in replacement' for whatever messaging app they currently use, it has to show all messages sent/received by them.

		Currently it is not possible to unregister from TextSecure (or I just can't find it). Some contacts try it and don't like or don't need it but their number stays as TextSecure enabled in the list. Messages to those people won't reach their recipient.

		Problem: TextSecure apparently uses trailing whitespaces in text messages. This makes it impossible to use with certain telco-services which rely on exact SMS-based short codes/activation codes. Requested solution: Please provide a way to disable trailing spaces (even at the expense of secure data messaging). In addition to that you could perhaps consider disabling it (as a sane default) for numbers with up to a few (e.g., 4) digits. Related to: Issue #304

		I've been reading a lot of blog posts, reviews and user feedback about TS lately. At least in Europe many people really aren't comfortable with the fact that it's currently not possible to opt out of uploading all phone numbers to the TS server, myself included. This is also not something only the crypto nerds (I mean that in a very positive way!) complain about, but also many average users. Probably because it's one of the few things they really understand in the difficult landscape of privacy and security. And especially the uninformed are very anxious when they are asked to give all their contacts away. They wouldn't give their own number to any stranger on the streets and now they are supposed to give some strangers on the internet all of their friends numbers? The internet is the place where all the russian cybercriminals steal their money and evil smartphone apps are the way they get the TANs for the banking accounts, right? This argument is typically used in conjunction with something along the lines of &quot;they are using US(=NSA) servers, oh no!&quot;. The second complaint may not be of any factual difference for the safety of the messages in a good crypto system, but that doesn't matter. It's repeated over and over again in blogs and reviews. Allowing users to opt-out is one of the easier things we can do to make privacy-aware users happy (and kill the US-server argument once and for all). I am aware of https://whispersystems.org/blog/contact-discovery/ and WhisperSystems#692 and would like to discuss the possibilities we have to increase the privacy of the TS contact discovery process. It appears that we are currently waiting for the silver bullet to be discovered, which probably won't happen any time soon. Below I listed the simplest solutions I could think of, which appear not to be overly complex to implement, but still give a good balance between effort and privacy. If you have other/better proposals, I'm all ears! Allow the user to opt-out and download the whole bloom filter Allow the user to opt-out and download a subset of the bloom filter based on the country code of the contacts. Realistically most people don't have contacts from more than 1-3 countries. It's a little less private and people with contacts from India, China and the US won't be much better off data volume wise, but most users will. Allow the user to opt-out and manually upgrade to push from the settings menu. This would be typically only used if the user knows the contact to be registered. This doesn't leak any information about unregistered users to the server and is basically what Threema does iirc. If we end up using 1. or 2., updates could be provided with tiny daily/hourly builds. This way the client only needs to know the global/server time + age of his database and can grab only the updates he's missing. If somebody needs to try push messages with the friend that just installed TS, because he told him about this great and secure app, we simply allow the user to do the manual upgrade from 3. The privacy-minded users will sacrifice the 40MB+ volume or do it when they are on wifi. I know dozens of people who downloaded gigabytes of OSM maps for OsmAnd. When other identifiers like emails will be allowed (WhisperSystems#1085) we are obviously in for another ride. The easiest solution would probably be WhisperSystems#1259 and allowing the user to enter the identifier manually if they aren't in the same location. Email addresses could be imported from the Android address book and upgraded via 3. tough. The preferred &quot;privacy friendly&quot; setting should be preselected if WhisperSystems#838 will be implemented. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I'll appreciate all input!

		I have two TS clients, which were not able to communicate with 2.0.5. Every message was received as bad encrypted message (see WhisperSystems#1213 (comment)) I installed 2.0.6 on both devices and re-registered for the push service. I updated the push contacts on both devices. Receiving from and sending to other TS clients is working fine on both devices. But the bad encrypted message problem between these two TS clients persists. The same problem is described in WhisperSystems#1296 but the solution &quot;end/restart the encrypted session&quot; could not be applied, because password was disabled on one device and blank on the other. To be able to restart the session I enabled and set nonempty passwords and restarted the session, but the problem is still there. When one of the two devices sends, the other one logs: 04-05 17:38:40.918 1665 4539 W IncomingEncryptedPushMessage: Our MAC: e6 aa f7 a5 38 a4 d6 af 99 a3 04-05 17:38:40.918 1665 4539 W IncomingEncryptedPushMessage: Thr MAC: e6 aa f7 a5 38 a4 d6 af 99 a3 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.InvalidMessageException: Bad Mac! 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: at org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.protocol.WhisperMessageV2.verifyMac(WhisperMessageV2.java:107) 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: at org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.SessionCipherV2.decrypt(SessionCipherV2.java:127) 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: at org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.SessionCipherV2.decrypt(SessionCipherV2.java:89) 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.DecryptingQueue$PushDecryptionWorkItem.run(DecryptingQueue.java:207) 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1088) 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:581) 04-05 17:38:41.098 1665 1708 W SessionCipherV2: at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1019) 04-05 17:38:41.108 1665 1708 W DecryptionQueue: org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.InvalidMessageException: No valid sessions. 04-05 17:38:41.108 1665 1708 W DecryptionQueue: at org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.SessionCipherV2.decrypt(SessionCipherV2.java:109) 04-05 17:38:41.108 1665 1708 W DecryptionQueue: at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.DecryptingQueue$PushDecryptionWorkItem.run(DecryptingQueue.java:207) 04-05 17:38:41.108 1665 1708 W DecryptionQueue: at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1088) 04-05 17:38:41.108 1665 1708 W DecryptionQueue: at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:581) 04-05 17:38:41.108 1665 1708 W DecryptionQueue: at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1019)

		I had several issues where recipients did NOT receive a message that was sent via PUSH. The reason being that they had data disabled or a privacy app was blocking features that TS needed or the sync with the TS servers did not work. My suggestion is to send an acknowledge back to the sender via the PUSH data channel. If TS does not see an acknowledge within 2 minutes, TS would try to resend the message via SMS (if the fallback is enabled) or notify the user that the message did not go through. Messaging should be reliable AND secure!

		Hello, I got my whole family to use TextSecure but sometime after the last update a few issues turned up. One family member kept getting removed from our group (&quot;X has left the group&quot;) and re-adding her did not help. We also could not send her any messages (&quot;Error sending message&quot;). I decided to reinstall TextSecure on her phone (SGS4), after creating an encrypted backup. However, using the import feature, the old password was rejected and we couldn't get past the password prompt. Creating a new account with the old password and THEN importing the backup worked, for some reason, but all messages were unreadable. Randomly sending messages to other family members, she was able to re-exchange keys (despite importing the backup, she now had a new key/ID) with some people, but not with me, for example. I still can't exchange messages with her and I don't see any option to exchange keys again. So this is half bug report and half plea for help to get things working again...

		This last weekend I had an issue where every received unencrypted message would crash the textsecure app. It would say I had received an &quot;encrypted message&quot; when in fact it was not. I found this out by trying to open the message from the notification area. When I did, the textsecure password screen came up and when I entered the password, it would pause for several seconds (10-15) and then crash (I did file the reports, but one of those even crashed). Once I restarted the app, I could enter the password and read the text. At which point all was clear until I received another unencrypted text and the scenario would repeat itself. Only when I restarted the phone would the behavior stop and I haven't had it happen since. Sorry I don't have better initial steps to reproduce. If this is too hard to track down at all I totally understand but I did want to write this up to go with the crash reports you hopefully did receive. Would have been on Saturday afternoon USA Mountain time.

		Hi, I receive a lot of messages in our group conversation and there is the litte problem. After picking up my phone after some time, I have to scroll up all the latest messages to search where the first latest message were received. Wouldn't it be easier if it jumps directly to first latest message, when I click on the conversation. And mark them as unread. Like Whatsapp or Threema do with their &quot;unread messages&quot; bar in the conversation. I wish i could show you an screenshot of this bar, but I deleted my accounts and deinstalled both. regards, KayuHD PS: Sorry for my bad englisch. I'm from germany :)

		this shows the newly created group - the messages are those of another existing single contact thread Have to admit, that I merged some pull requests - but I could not imagine what changes could have caused this. What I did: I created a group with one contact named it (with emoji) added a push contact by selecting it added a my number by typing it in finished creating I remember there was an issue describing this behavior - can't find it anymore. Still trying to reproduce this...

		Since 2.0.6 it seems there is no fallback from push to sms if the receiver is offline: Mobile 1 is online and tries to send a message to mobile 2. Both mobiles are registered for push. Message is sent via push, but mobile 2 doesn't receive the message because it's offline. Next time it get online it receives the message. Is this a bug or a expected behavior? Vice versa (mobile 2, offline --&gt; mobile 1, online) messages are delivered immediately via sms.

		observed behavior: When flipping the phone while composing a TextSecure message such that landscape mode gets activated, the send button does not indicate whether the message will be secured. (I.e. a gray button with the text 'Send' is displayed.) When not typing (no keyboard displayed), everything is fine. expected behavior: A colored send button with a padlock indicating whether the message will be encrypted is displayed while typing. (Just as when not in landscape mode.) possible solutions: Can TextSecure modify the Android landscape keyboard? If yes, then the send button should be adapted. If not, maybe collapse the keyboard instead of sending when in landscape mode? That way, the TextSecure send button would be displayed (and would have to be pressed to actually send the message). While not ideal, this should at least avoid accidentally sending unencrypted messages.

		wrong ActionBar title: open an existing group select update group ActionBar correct title: &quot;Update Group: some groupname&quot; leave the activity by locking the screen, adding a member or adding an avatar when you return to the group settings the action bar title now is: &quot;New Group&quot; The default group avatar is not circle cropped, in the settings activity. Edit: fixed many commits ago Edit 2: unfixed lately Leaving the group settings with the check mark - without effectively changing something (name, members, avatar) - leads to a group update broadcast. This is distracting for the receivers when nothing has changed. Group conversation recipients dialog allows tapping a contact to highlight it shortly. is there any reason for that? Planned features maybe? fixed An avatar can not be changed back to default

		Messages can be selected, when you long press on the message bubble or on the space next to it, when the bubble doesn't fill the screen from left to right. When a message contains a hyperlink, it can't be select by long pressing on the space next to it. Long pressing directly on the hyperlink opens the action window which asks, with which app you want to open the link and another window which asks, what do you want to do with the message. If you try to copy and paste (or share) the link, another message of the current chat gets copied and not the hyperlink.

		I experienced this twice now with my friend. TextSecure is working fine. She turns off her smartphone, replaces the battery and then restarts the phone After a while I try to send her a push message but TextSecure wants me to use the SMS fallback But I can receive the push messages sent by her In the log I see some &quot;UserNotFound&quot; exceptions and &quot;Receiver not registered&quot;. The problem persist. The only fix we found so far: She has to disable push messages. And then enable it again.

		Heyho! I can successfully send and recieve push messages to resp. from other users but one: This very user registered her phone to the push service (is green in my contact list), but TextSecure seems to ignore this fact and insists on sending messages via SMS. The UI looks as if the receiving user doesn't have TextSecure installed, i.e. there is no lock symbol etc. I used to send SMS messages to this user via TextSecure, before this user installed it on her phone. Is there a way to convince TextSecure to use push? Deleting the existing conversation didn't help. http://hastebin.com/musugexido (I didn't find the phone number in the log, sending SMS works, however I disabled it for testing purpose)

		I posted this to the whispersystems mailing list, and was directed here. TextSecure keeps arbitrarily (not related to receiving any sms) launching it's unlock activity. This will completely interrupt a running application. Also, sometimes when I unlock my phone, the TextSecure unlock activity is showing, despite not having been active when I locked it. I captured a debug log immediately after this happened. http://hastebin.com/qetemaveyi Of note: I am running TextSecure 2.0.7 on Android 4.4.2 on a Samsung Galaxy Note3 on TMobile. Hope this helps. If there is anything I can do to help debug this issue further, please feel free to contact me. Cheers, Darrik

		Long pressing the send button should reveal more options. I'm particularly interested in manual send as SMS while connected. Otherwise it's going through hoops to disable data/WiFi and back to the app. I mean sometimes people just don't have data plans and get my texts 7-8 hours later when at home on WiFi. Defeats the whole purpose of default SMS app option. Thanks!

		As already mentioned by @tinloaf in WhisperSystems#1351 (comment) the phone number is leaked in PushServiceSocket.java makeBaseRequest. The line  Log.w(&quot;PushServiceSocket&quot;, method +  &quot;  --  &quot; + body); leaks the recipient number to the a log entry like: 3834-3856/org.thoughtcrime.securesms W/PushServiceSocket﹕ PUT  --  {&quot;destination&quot;:&quot;+4XXXXXXXXXXX&quot;,&quot;messages&quot;:[{&quot;body&quot;:&quot;IgohB ...
 Isn't this affected by the wiki entry &quot;Be careful what you log!&quot;? Maybe Log.w(&quot;DatabaseFactory&quot;, &quot;Updated body: &quot; + body + &quot; and part_count: &quot; + partCount); in DatabaseFactory.java onApplicationLevelUpgrade() is also affected. Didn't test.

		On many Android devices ADB debugging is enabled, allowing anyone with physical access to the device to make a full backup of apps and their files/settings. This can be disabled by setting android:allowBackup to false in the AndroidManifest.xml. It may not add much security for cases in which the user used a strong password to encrypt the TextSecure files. But consider the following scenario: unrooted smartphone Attacker has physical access for a short period of time no/weak/circumvented lockscreen password unknown but weak TextSecure encryption password. Even with physical access the user isn't allowed to read the /data/data folder and can only do online attacks against the TextSecure password. But if he/she is able to copy the whole TextSecure folder, the attacker can do offline attacks, more or less instantly breaking all simple passwords. There is also a nice talk, demonstrating this exact problem with password container apps like LastPass (interesting part minute ~13): http://blog.deepsec.net/?p=1740

		Together with WhisperSystems#1387 it would be useful to block online attacks against weak passwords by waiting maybe 10 seconds after three failed attempts. After that doubling the wait time would strongly increase protection against online attacks.

		If I try to send an SMS to multiple people (using the group functionality, that is the only way I can find to do this) that are not using TextSecure, the program wants to send that as an MMS. My normal SMS program (stock one in PACMan ROM based on Android 4.2.2) allows sending this as SMS instead, by sending a separate SMS to each recipient. Given that I have 5000 free SMS per month but MMS cost a small amount of money per message on my carrier this is not an option for me. For now I uninstalled TextSecure until this issue can be fixed, this is a feature I can not live without.

		tl;dr I propose to add a clean &quot;registering a number by SMS to a different device&quot; step. User Story: As a new user, when I want to register my telephone number B (SIM card for number B temporary inserted into my mobile phone B) on my tablet A (a device without phone or SMS capabilities) with the TextSecure PUSH server, I have to enter the mobile number B into the TextSecure registration form on tablet A start the registration progress (my device B immediately receives (a first) 6-digit verification code SMS) [X] wait for the 2 minute time-out on tablet A (because A cannot receive the registration SMS) press the button on A for registration via an automated telephone voice call which now triggers the registration process by voice call to device B (user must be capable to understand a female voice, English language. This is a second and different verification code. Problem: Not everyone is able to understand the quite quickly spoken verification code on the phone. Not everyone understands the English message Users cannot enter the first verification code: because there is no possibility (no input form) in the current registration workflow Users have to know to wait for the timeout in order to trigger the &quot;sent me code by voice call&quot; process Observation: I regard the second SMS by voice as superfluous (in the standard case), because I already obtained a verification code on my device B at step [X], when I would only be able to enter this code on device A. @moxie0 I think the verification workflow should be deliberately modified which solves many issues: before starting the verification process at the device A, after having entered the telephone number, two new second buttons are proposed automatic registration (this is the present workflow with the silent SMS to the device where you press the button, but you have to enter the telephone (BTW: Can't this be fetched from the Android automatically?) new button: &quot;manual registration&quot; (a verification code is sent via SMS to the device with the entered number) new button: &quot;registration by voice call&quot; (you receive an automated telephone call on the device with the entered number, and a six-digit verification code in English will be presented) Advantages of my proposal: lower workload on TS registration server (the second SMS is not necessary, this step after the 2-minute-timeout is obsolete in the case that the user can receive the verification code on their second device) time saving: the user does not have wait for the 2-minute timeout easier: no need to understand the English voice message verification code text message (SMS) could be i10n/i18n

		Open textsecure Press &quot;+&quot; to create a new conversation. Tap home key to do some other activity. Long-press home key. Notice contact list with phone numbers showing. Probably not the end of the world but typically the app shows a blank screen for security purposes and this current behavior didn't fit what I thought was the current paradigm. My feelings won't be hurt if this gets closed our anything. Just hoping to help ferret out the bugs. Long live Textsecure!

			<description>
		This all started because TextSecure had shown an incoming picture message of a picture I had sent a friend a few days earlier from a number I did not recognize. After doing some digging I got the idea to double check my phone records to see if TextSecure had received this message via push or SMS. What I found was extremely odd because my carrier usage showed that I had sent the picture message to this random number. The reason I speculate this image has come from TextSecure local database is because I had deleted the picture, from my SD card, after I had initially sent it. There does also appear to be an issue with my TextSecure local database because I tried to send the same friend a picture of my usage summary and after the send button was pressed the picture swapped to a picture he had previously sent me in our conversation. Although it showed the incorrect picture on my end he reported the correct picture did however make it to him. I have attached my original screenshots that show the incoming picture message, an outgoing message from me, and my usage report showing that both messages were in fact outgoing.

The only way to switch off sound is to have a sound file that contains no sound at all. Rename the current Sound widget to Sound file. Add a Sound checkbox above and use it to gray/ungray the Sound file widget. Aka: Sound        [ x ]

			<description>
		This is so bizarre I didn't know how to explain it properly in the title. Right now I have this text in the phone number field at the top of a thread in textsecure: &quot;+1510xxxxxxx - Sms and and generally use the&quot; (The xxxxxxx are actually 7 digits I just omitted them to preserve his privacy) This text should NOT be in a field meant for a telephone number! How did this happen? Well, I got a text from someone that went through my google voice number and was telling me they had a new number so I tried to copy just the number google puts there at the beginning of the text but It copied the whole text. I went into their address book entry and cleared their old number field to replace with the new data. When I pasted I noticed there was a bunch of text after the number so I cleared it all except the number then saved. I'm not sure if i saved the text by accident then edited it again or... maybe i saved the number that it was relayed to first then finally the proper number (not the google voice relay number)... it is a blur in my mind. When I went back into TextSecure instead of their number under their name I saw part of the text message in there. So bizarre. The google voice is ANOTHER google account pointing to my number, not the one that holds the address book on my phone. This number was copied from the text that is placed their automatically by google voice, he didnt add his number to the text himself. I don't know if that matters. I have deleted any thread from him in textsecure and started new ones. I have restarted my phone. I have deleted and created a new contact for this friend in my google address book, both on my phone and in a web browser which then syncs with my phone. I have deleted the whole thread from the other google voice account. I also tried renaming the contact in my address book... nope. Every time I get a new text from him or start a new thread to him this same bad string is in the phone number field under his name. No matter what I do it won't go away. It doesn't matter if I am connected to wifi or not (I have no data plan)... This makes me assume this data is stuck in a textsecure database somewhere. Why is the data in the contact phone number field not just retrieved from the address book on the phone at some regular intervals or at startup? Why is textsecure holding it forever in some table? The table must be associating a number to a number string... but why? Why not just use the actual number?? I notice that some contact number strings have a +1 in front of the number (USA international code) and some do not even though NO CONTACTS in my address book have this +1... so textsecure has a strange way of handling this data. How does it decide what to make this string? There are errors in this function. My suggestion is to retrieve this data from the phone address book and store it or maybe refresh it every time the password is entered or every week or something. I don't know the programming aspect... Thank you!

		My phone died earlier today, and once I had my phone connected to power and back on I found that TextSecure would not accept my password. I tried entering it more than a dozen times, and even tried copy+pasting the password from a text editor. Eventually, I did a bit of googling, and the comment WhisperSystems#190 (comment) made me think to quit and reopen the app. I removed the app from my app switcher, opened a task manager to ensure it had quit, and then reopened the app. It then accepted my password on my first try. Perhaps the commenters in that thread were having the same issue, but failed to identify it properly? (Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini GT-I8190N running latest firmware from Vodafone, Android 4.1.2)

		I have an incoming thread for a conversation (447XXXXXXXXX) and an outgoing (07XXXXXXXXX). If I try and reply to the first one (447...) it fails, I'm assuming because it's not prefixed with a +. And so the work around is to reply to the same number but swapping 447 or 07. This is incredibly broken, is there any way to fix it?

		This happened to me on both my phone and my wifes phone: After flashing a new ROM and restoring Textsecure messages from an encrypted backup, there is a problem with push messages (can't be received or sent, I don't remember which). This can be fixed by re-registering for push-messages, but since there is no indication that messages don't get through this can be a real problem for people when they change they phones and want to take their messages with them.

		I didn't look at the code, but from the behaviour I suspect that we only check what channel the contact supports instead of actually checking for an internet connection. Can't we just ping google or the push server as soon as text is entered, (hopefully not DOSing it) to evaluate if we have a working internet connection? Apparently the Android framework already offers a function for that. Simply checking if wifi or mobile data are enabled is probably not good enough in case of captive portals and patchy reception.

		We were on the road when I wrote a message to a groupchat. When I was ready for sending the message, my phone has gone to roaming mode and disabled data channel. TS did try to fall back to SMS which failes for group chats. Then a notification is shown like &quot;SMS could not be sent, will be resent later&quot;. There seems to be an aggressive loop for this, as this notification didn't go away from my screen until my phone went out of roaming mode again. It did stay there whichever app I was starting...

		Just noticed a completely empty conversation list. The entries only came back only on closing TS in the recent apps list. TS was fully responsive though. Checked the errorlog and found the scary entries. The X-es are my name and my number (a bit to verbose logging maybe) The last thing I remember I did before was sending me an SMS from the stock SMS App and switching TS to default SMS receiver before the SMS came in.

		Hi, This is a question of usage, but you may turn it into a &quot;documentation bug&quot;. I registered my cellphone # with TextSecure. I received a regular SMS from TextSecure (+1 412-212-8916) with a verification code. What do I do with it? I couldn't find on TextSecure a place to enter it. And I couldn't find a reference to verification code in the TextSecure documentation either. Thank you Gustavo F.

		In Germany we use without exception the 24h format. This is also configured in Android's localization settings. However, when opening the details of a message (long press -&gt; message details) sent at, day 15:23, it comes up as &quot;3:23 nachm.&quot; which makes absolutely no sense in German.

		With the latest TextSecure my friend and I experience the following problem: When sending a message or when receiving a message the app is responding slowly/lagging. Example: Type a message Send message Right after sending the message type a new message =&gt; Keys are not processed, the app reacts slowly/lags Example: Type a message App receives a message =&gt; Keys are not processed, the app reacts slowly/lags After a few seconds everything is working smoothly again

		Carrier: Sprint Phone: HTC Evo LTE Debug Info: http://hastebin.com/usonicabuf For example, I will have a group chat going on, as people post pictures to it I won't always get them and instead I'll have separate messages from each person that suggests I &quot;Download&quot; the message, when I do it fails and the MMS proxy settings for sprint are configured correctly I believe.

		Hi, I'm living in a country where you do not have a permanent internet connection. When you send a message to another TextSecure user while you are online, all further messages will be delivered via internet. If my internet connection drops, and my partner sends a message to me, I won't get it until I'm back online. I would request a feature on the senders phone (online), which checks with the server if the push message was delivered after a certain amount of time (e.g. 5 minutes). If it was not received by the receiver, a notification in the NotificationBar should pop up, which asks the sender if he/she wants to resend the message via SMS. I would love to implement this feature on my own, but before doing that I'd like to hear your comments! Regards, sternze

		I restored TextSecure using TitaniumBackup on my new phone and after de-registering and re-registering push I was able to communicate with most contacts. However I still got &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; from one contact. I needed to &quot;End Secure Session&quot; with this contact, after that it started to work. However as far as I can see there should be no need to do this (as mentioned, it worked automatically for other contacts). The log looks a bit suspicious: --------- beginning of /dev/log/main V/GCMBroadcastReceiver( 6998): onReceive: com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE V/GCMBroadcastReceiver( 6998): GCM IntentService class: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.gcm.GcmIntentService V/GCMBaseIntentService( 6998): Acquiring wakelock V/GCMBaseIntentService( 6998): Intent service name: GCMIntentService-DynamicSenderIds-13 W/GcmIntentService( 6998): GCM message...

		Hi, I tried several time to send a message to a new contact or number with the plus sign. I added the contact and number, wrote the text and can't sent it, apps telling me that it's not a valid number, for every number I could write. I work with an Acer liquid Gallant Duo on Android 4.0.3 not rooted and the last version of textsecure available, any ideas? Thanks

		Humans are better at comparing images than comparing a long string. Currently, the latter is used in TextSecure, and it's very inconvenient. My proposal is to be inspired by Telegram, here is how Telegram users compare their shared key: Important: If we take that path, there is one problem which Telegram didn't resolve and we should - Users often compare their key visualizations over an insecure channel. The most common way is for them to take a screenshot of the key visualization and then send it via Telegram itself. This defeats the purpose of key visualizations, because Telegram should be considered an insecure channel until the keys are compared outside of it. The solution is just a simple message like: &quot;Please compare your key visualizations in real life / over a secure channel, never compare your key visualization via TextSecure itself&quot;

		I encountered this with a friend of mine who reflashed his phone and subsequently reregistered. I had an ongoing chat (using his old key) with him and noticed today that he had sent me a message yesterday and I had to accept the new key. But I didn't get notified about the new message in the notification bar I would expect Textsecure to generate notifications for all events including the key changed event, since this may lead to unnoticed messages, depending on usage pattern of course. If this behaviour is intentional, it would be great to know the rationale behind this. Anyways I want to thank you for your amazing work! Steps to reproduce: User A and User B both register with Textsecure Both Users exchange a couple of messages User B reregisters with Textsecure changing his key User B send User A a Message No notification is shown on User A's device Expected behaviour: User A should be notified of the incoming message with the new key

		Hi, A friend and I are using TextSecure 2.0.8. I'm running Android 4.4.2 and he's running 4.3. We've exchanged dozen of encrypted messages in the past and everything worked fine. A few days ago, I sent him a message with an image and he replied. It worked as expected. Then I replied with a text message. It was sent as a regular SMS, the bubble color was green. (I was in a place with very bad 3G signal). Instead of receiving the message I sent him, he received a key icon, then a couple of hours later, what looks like encrypted text : He then sent me a message that appeared to be sent correctly from his side (blue bubble, nothing special), but appeared as &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; from my side. I replied him, the message appeared to have been sent correctly from my side (blue bubble, nothing special), but he received a &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; too. From this moment, all the messages we exchange are received as &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot;. Here are his logs and mine : https://gist.github.com/tbalthazar/7afe026443ee266cb4fb Please let me know if you need more info. Cheers, Thomas.

		I am not aware of individual countries' rules and regulations; however, on their control list page ( http://www.wassenaar.org/controllists/index.html ) there's this document: http://www.wassenaar.org/controllists/2013/WA-LIST%20%2813%29%201/02%20-%20WA-LIST%20%2813%29%201%20-%20GTN%20and%20GSN.doc Controls do not apply to &quot;technology&quot; &quot;in the public domain&quot;, to &quot;basic scientific research&quot; or to the minimum necessary information for patent applications.
 The document further elaborates: The Lists do not control &quot;software&quot; which is any of the following:
1.  Generally available to the public by being:
    a.  Sold from stock at retail selling points without restriction, by means of:
        1.  Over-the-counter transactions;

A has no problems in sending to other users, also sending to newley registered users works. Background data, and syncs are on, and WiFi or mobile data are working.

			<description>
		With reference to #1397 and after a discussion with @generalmanager I like to propose this small UX change during the registration step 2 (when the silent sms is used to register the device's number). Current situation: During Step 2, the registration currently waits for 2 minutes to receive the (first) registration SMS. This registration obviously fails in the case that the device (e.g. a tablet without SMS/MMS functions) is unable to receive SMS. If the user has a different device e.g. a smartphone with their SIM card and SMS/MMS enabled, they receive the first code on this device. After the timeout the first code is not valid any longer. The user can manually trigger the TS server to send a second six-digit-code via the Code-by-Voice-call function, and then enter the second code to finish the registration on their tablet. My suggestion (TOFU-compliant): In oder to comply with the trust-on-first-use (TOFU) principle and to avoid the abvove mentioned second registration cycle by voice (in the case of a tablet without SMS/MMS function) I suggest a code change to allow the entering of the six-digit-code already during the first cycle. I mean this: already during registration step 2 - while the device waits for 2 minutes to receive the first verification code in a silent SMS users should be able to enter the (first) code manually in case they are in possession of it because they received it on their other, SMS/MMS-enabled phone device. In my view this appears to be possible, and does not break the workflow, or introduces security threats. Advantages Less registration codes need to be sent, lowering the number of &quot;registration failures during step 2&quot; (when the device cannot receive SMS, but the SMS was sent to another device of the user) much easier and quicker registration for tablet users, because the timeout does not matter any more: user cann immediately enter the code in the first cycle (TOFU)

		I'm referencing this issue: WhisperSystems#1249 Would it be possible to make this optional via settings (enabled by default)? I often receive multiple questions spread across multiple messages and the fact that TS didn't automatically scroll every time I sent a reply was very useful. I really liked being able to answer questions one by one without having to scroll back up every time I replied to one.

However, I am also someone able to use github etc. So the average user might not be able.

		One time, after TextSecure crashed then I immediately reopened it, it asked me for my password, then when I entered the wrong password it still opened like I had entered the right password. I'm sure the password was wrong. This could have been because the password was cached already even though TextSecure thought it wasn't. I don't know.

		Dear developers, following the build instructions on http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Build_for_mako I am building my own custom CM 11. For some apps I like, I could integrate them according to &quot;the right way&quot; on http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_adding_your_own_app but unfortunately, I cannot manage that for TextSecure. Could you please at some time address this issue, so that one can compile TextSecure from search when building an own Android? I like cutting edge systems built from GitHub sources and this can help you also with more nightly / beta-testing. Thanks a lot!

		While confirming issue #1476 and doing some tests, I deleted the conversation thread between two phones in both phones (Moto G and Nexus 4). Then, from the Nexus 4, I attempted to attach an image to send it to the Moto G. The image is sent and received correctly, but the preview thumbnail in the originating Nexus 4 phone (and only there!) is from a different image that I had received or sent previously in the deleted thread. From the Moto G I don't see the same problem.

		I have installed TextSecure for many of my friends recently, and have found on phones without a hard/soft menu button on the phone (which results in the vertical &quot;...&quot; on the top-right of most apps for replacement) do not have the unlocked padlock icon from which to initiate a key exchange. Once I established a key exchange from my phone which has a soft menu button, however, the locked padlock icon appears to discontinue the secure session. I have found this to be true on any android phone lacking the hard or soft menu buttons. If a specific example is required, the most recent phone I found this to be an issue on was the HTC Desire.

		I have a somehow special setup. As I use my mobile phone for business and private contacts I do not send my number when calling in general. So I have switched that off. For people that should see it's me calling them I have added the *31# GSM code in their phone number in the contacts so that my number is shown to them. (I do this because I have to take hotline calls from time to time and calling them back should not show my number). I now tried using TextSecure and found that when I type in a number that's in my contacts (and I type the number without the *31#) TextSecure automatically finds it and takes the number with the GSM code in front of it. Thus no SMS ever gets send because the taken number does not work on SMS. Would be great to have the GSM code filtered away, thus I could use the Contacts (which is also not possible with the standard SMS app with my setup) fully or at least just take the number I've typed into without looking it up further (this is how the standard app behaves). If there is any more information needed just let me know. kr Tom

		one needs to touch the &quot;phone&quot; icon to get to the screen where one can add a new contact for a sender phone number (e.g. after one got a msg from that sender). this is bad because of 2 reasons: a) there is no connection between &quot;i want to add this contact&quot; and a &quot;phone&quot; icon (which usually means &quot;call the person&quot;) b) one might not want to call the other person and therefore would not even touch the icon because you do not know if that immediately triggers an outgoing voice call (and thus you never find out that adding the contact is on the next screen)

		I recently installed CyanogenMod but can't remember how I backed things up, in any case I reregistered my number. I think I was writing with that contact after I switched to CM, but one day, she couldn't write me anymore. My messages to her were delivered just fine and she could read them, but she couldn't reply via push (SMS was disabled). Trying to end a secure chat also didn't work, she got the termination message but the app couldn't reply. I just reregistered my number again and now she can text me just fine. So I'm not sure what went wrong, but I'm reporting this because I think there should be more diagnostics or messages why something couln't be delivered instead of just failing to send anything without explanation.

		I have noticed (through several TextSecure versions running on Android 4.1.x and now 4.2.2) that if I select the second-last message in certain threads and delete it, it will reliably delete the last message instead. If I scroll up to the top and try to delete the first message, it'll delete some message below, but not the second. Same with trying to delete the second message. It doesn't happen in all threads. I have one huge thread from &quot;Anonymous&quot; (various services that send messages from names like &quot;LM-VODAFONE&quot;, for which the sender shows up in TextSecure as &quot;Unknown&quot; in &quot;Message details&quot;), and that's where I've noticed it most often. I realise this is a rather vague report, but I'd be happy to try and help with debugging if anyone has ideas for things I should try.

		So, I sent my friend an unencrypted SMS message. For whatever reason, TextSecure crashed and restarted. When I logged in, I tried to respond to him, and found that suddenly he was secure (blue messages/arrow). I'm not sure how, since he wasn't before. I haven't confirmed to make sure that he's using the app, but I don't think he is. Sending him a few messages (encrypted) failed. When I try to end the secure session, I got an error (the triangle icon): Secure session ended.

		It would be nice to be able to send a message to multiple numbers without having to use the group function. If it is just for one message I should not need to create a new group. edit: I just realized I cannot send messages through groups at all, if there is one person not using TextSecure. My provider/contract does not support MMS. So I am not able to use TextSecure for sending multiple messages without copy and pasting the content to every person -_-

		I tried to follow the instructions on https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone/wiki/Configuring-Eclipse to setup my ADT for building TextSecure, but failed to use the ADT for building TextSecure. (Before you ask, yes using ./gradlew build does work.) If it is possible, can anyone perhaps create a new and updated Wiki page for TextSecure, i.e. how to configure and using ADT for building and debugging TextSecure?

		How do you bill sms send and received from a user who don't uses text secure? My provider, Congster in Germany, has billed all sms send via text secure. I'm very surprised. Is this correct that these sms need to be payed? If yes this tool maybe secure but useless as the invidence in Germany is very very low. Looking forward for your answer. Best wishes, Ediz

		After uninstalling TextSecure on one phone, the other phone still sends encrypted messages to it, which results in the phone receiving encrypted messages only. I'm not sure if there is a way of notifying key-exchanged partners about the uninstall but maybe this is of interest to the developers.

			<description>
		I installed text secure based off a recommendation by a friend. I realized most of my contacts don't use this service so I uninstalled it. I now have two contacts that use text secure , and whenever they attempt to text me I get a unreadable message. Like this : HHJABBAOOIWHAHS3123191362ASAIHASBSD814612401246+KABQIWRB7579127. It is not a HUGE deal but its quite a hassle , for them and for me, to constantly remind them that they cant use text secure when messaging me. I assume that since I used to use TextSecure , that somehow it is still thinking that I can receive secure messagaes ? Even after uninstallation? ( Clarification : I can message Textsecure users , and they receive &quot; Hey , how are you&quot; , however when they respond all I receive is &quot; KAKSHHAO+89HABIFUBIWOH+AISHBASFIUASF&quot; , when in reality they said &quot; I'm good how are you&quot;) I have done alot of research and I was told that sometimes it takes the developers some time to * unregister* phone numbers ; however it has been over 2 months. Any ideas or suggestions would be immensely helpful!

		Hi, I installed TextSecure yesterday and came across an irregular behavior on the multitasking screen on my Nexus 4, running Android 4.2.2. Steps to reproduce: Open TextSecure plus two other random apps Go to the mutitasking screen Swipe one of the two random apps to the right. This is what happens: the app is removed from the list, the list stays open (expected behavior) Now swipe TextSecure to the right (one other app still has to be in the list) Result: TextSecure is removed from the list and the multitasking screen is closed immediately. Expected behavior: Usually, the multitasking screen would remain open until the last app has been removed. Furthermore, if I want to re-access the multitasking screen directly after it has been closed( by removing TextSecure from the list), it does not react - I have to wait around three seconds before the multitasking button starts reacting again.

		As someone whith a limited amount of free sms per month it would be great to have a statistic of how many sms I send in the last month, or something similar. Normally I would use an additional app for this, but since TextSecure has it's own storage for sms (which is great, because it's encrypted) those apps won't work. I know that this isn't a high priority feature but it would still be great to have it. Kind regards David.

		it should be possible to override a stored key by scanning a new one. but it just says &quot;warning, the scanned key does not match!&quot;. if the user knows that the old key is outdated/gone, it should be possible to say &quot;use the scanned key&quot; at this place.

		This might not be a very useful issue, since I'm recalling what happened from memory, but it was bad enough to be reported I think. I lost around 3 months of text messages. Yesterday I was trying to send a push text to another TS user. After hitting the send button a dialog appeared below the message bubble saying something like &quot;click here for insecure fallback mode&quot;. I had never seen this before and was reluctant to send an insecure message so I ignored it and tried again, same dialog. I don't recall what I did next to try to remedy the situation, I might have force closed textsecure, I'm not sure. But when I returned to the list of messages, all the contact names where &quot;anonymous&quot;, but the icon for each thread looked correct. I then tried to create a new text message to myself, this brought up a text thread for a completely different person. I realized something was very wrong, so I decided to export my text messages and reinstall textsecure. I did this, and was not able to import the encrypted database. Once it just said &quot;bad password&quot;, once it allowed me to, but all of the texts read &quot;bad encrypted message&quot;. I should also add that I have not been able to &quot;register&quot; with textsecure again through sms. I click register and the text never comes. However the calling method works. I hope this is helpful.

		Me and a friend of mine got the client up to date. Myself on Android, she's on iOS. When she sends messages to me, they arrive promptly, however, when I send messages to her, they either don't arrvie at all or 3-5 days after being sent. Any ways to fix this? (did already browse some older issues, but none of them could solve the problem)

		If I click back on a message, I often see the same message multiple times. A single message should only be in the back stack once. Also after clicking a notification, clicking back should return you to your previous app, now cycle you through all activity of TextSecure.

		I have noticed a strange behavior of Text secure on Android 4.2 and 4.3.1 which seems to be reproducable. A certainly correct password was not accepted by textsecure this happened not only to me but also to an acquaintance of mine. Both passwords ckntakned special charakters Like äüö¥π#.. Both devices are Samsung Galaxy s4 minis

		As far as I understand the protocol, a &quot;last resort&quot; prekey (that doesn't provide forward secrecy) is used for offline session establishment if all regular prekeys on the server have been used. Are users warned if that situation occurs?

		I've been using TextSecure for a while and love it. Great work everyone. Recently my wife got a new phone. We re-exchanged keys and everything works okay. Except when I'm typing to her I see X/60 at the bottom. Rather than splitting up the text at 160 chars it tries to split it at 60 characters. She's the only contact I have that does this. the rest still do 160 characters. I'm running the latest version on the Play Store. If I need to supply any additional debug info I can.

		Ver 2.0.8 on Android 4.4.2. Believe relatively new problem. Displayed TXTs show a timestamp of +1 hour in the message list. When I look at message details, received TXTs have a sent time around an hour in the future. The received time looks correct. Does not seem to correlate/change with senders timezone. Re-searched after posting and see some other that imply 'Sent time' is merely displaying what the carrier presents. Is my carrier merely using a +1 timezone from my local, so this expected? Is there a reason the received time isn't displayed in the message list? Definitely arguable, but displaying received seems like a reasonable default.

		Currently there is no way to easily add an unknown number to the contact list. There should be an option in the long-press menu of a thread and in the extra options menu in the in-thread view to add a number to your contacts. Currently you have to write the number down, then add it to your contacts manually.

		I have a problem. Since I installed TextSecure, when I use my phone's default &quot;People&quot; application to add new contacts, they are not displayed. The application saves them, but doesn't display them anywhere. When I open TextSecure though, there they are. So TS can see those new contacts, but the &quot;People&quot; app (which created them) can't. After changing some (may I say random?) settings I managed to fix it. However my friends have the same problem. Please fix it, it's frustrating and I can't get regular people to use it if they encounter problems like this :/ Thank you. p.s.: I'm sorry if it's a known bug, I tried to search for similar posts but couldn't find anything

		To select a normal message I can hold anywhere on or beside the message. But if the message contains a link or linked number, then nothing happens if I hold beside the text. If I hold a linked number the dialog shows up but then my phone will open the dial dialog and when I come back the &quot;select menu&quot; is closed again. So the only choice for me to select a message that contains a &quot;linked&quot; number is to hold on a non-linked part of the text (which is quite difficult for messages like &quot;1000&quot;). Can this be reproduced/fixed? Also is there a way to better detect whether a number should be &quot;linked&quot; at all?

		Hi, I have just upgraded to a Nexus 5 with CM11. I can receive text and MMS messages but there is no notification sound. The LED and vibrate works fine. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling text secure but that has not fixed the problem, when text secure was uninstalled I tried using the default messaging app and could not receive any test text messages. Does anyone know what the problem might be? Thanks, Ben

		I have rebooted the phone a few times and uninstalled, rebooted, then reinstalled the app. I have searched through the default messaging as well. It's my wife's phone. I have the exact same phone on the exact same network w/no issues so far (knock on wood). Running: Android 4.4.2 Moto G on Boost Mobile systems passphrase encrypted Debug logs Broken phone: http://hastebin.com/uracimajiq Good phone: http://hastebin.com/dupdutacu I am happy to continue assisting debugging, if devs will keep in touch with me :) TIA edit: Usually incoming SMS shows up in notification bar when first received, but nowhere to be found in TS app. double edit: after clearing data and cache, then uninstalling. Messaging is completely broken even for the default app. Is there a way to fix this short of a factory reset? HELP!

		I've installed TS, and until a few minutes ago I was unable to send any kind of PUSH message, it was defaulting to SMS, all the time. Admittedly there is only one contact in my list that I can use TS with. The app wasn't recognizing this contact as a TS user, it appeared in the list of TS users, but I could only send SMS (which failed right away because I disabled the SMS send function from the options). From what I can tell the problem is that when I exchanged my identity with this contact (over SMS) I didn't have the international prefix included in his number (he's from another country). This created an entry within my SMS database with that number. After installing TS and being unable to send PUSH messages I noticed this and added the international prefix. Nothing changed and I was still unable to send messages. Upon sending more messages I noticed that at the top of the window, next to the contact name there was still the old number without the prefix. At first I thought this was a display issue, but then I cleared the app's data, redid the initial setup but SKIPPED the SMS import procedure. This fixed the problem. Without any previous SMS to take the number from, the app took it from the contact list (or at least that's what I assume has happened) and of course took the right one. I can now send PUSH without any problem and at this point importing the SMS db worked fine and kept the correct number. I hope this help somebody and can be fixed. Cheers

		GPL license requires all source files have a license header. I have added it to those those files that didn't have it After that I have also updated Copyright notices: &quot;2013 Open Whisper Systems&quot; to &quot;2013-2014 Open WhisperSystems&quot; Note the removed space. This is the correct name, right? And changed Copyright from Moxie Marlinspike to Whisper Systems, for consistency with the rest of files. Please @moxie0 confirm that you are fine with it :) One doubt is when does copyright from Whisper Systems end and Open WhisperSystems begin? Is updating &quot;2011 Whisper Systems&quot; to &quot;2011-2012&quot; fine? Or does 2012 belong to Open WhisperSystems?

		ok, I just took a look at a small part of the code. I found this https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/crypto/PRNGFixes.java#L297 . I don't know what this seed is used for, but you should make sure that it is not used for important things, because: UID is predictable, especially on rooted devices time is used twice build fingerprint and serialnumber is predictable, too Please someone, check this!!!

		I was recently in an area of very low Internet connectivity on my phone. While there, I installed TextSecure and linked up with a friend who already has it. I was able to send and receive encrypted messages to/from this user, but when it came to SMS messages, I was able to send but a lot of the time would not receive them. I have browsed the GIT issue logs just to check that this issue hasn't already been fixed, but couldn't find one exactly matching my problem. From what I read, it could be a GCM problem. I have a Samsung GT-I9505 running Android 4.4.2. Would you like me to provide a log? Thanks.

			<description>
		I have a contact with Textsecure who at one point fell back to SMS during a conversation. My &quot;phone&quot; is a wifi only device and currently receives SMS via Google Voice, so this didn't work. I sent him a message saying I can't fall back to SMS and disabled it on my side, and then got one or two from him later saying that he couldn't restart a secure session. I also got a couple &quot;secure session ended&quot; messages and the &quot;send&quot; UI element turned to the green (should be red, IMO) unlocked one. Now, with network connectivity good, every message I send results in &quot;Error sending message!&quot; with absolutely no additional useful information as to WHY there was an error, WHAT the error was, and WHAT I may do to correct it. There is no UI element to restart a secure session. It doesn't exist, or at least, I can't find it in 5 minutes of searching, which means for all practical purposes it doesn't exist. Thinking to &quot;reset&quot; the state between my contact and myself, I selected &quot;delete thread&quot; and erased our prior messages. He then DISAPPEARED FROM MY CONTACT LIST (wtf?) and, despite having an identity key still in my contact keys, there's no way to re-add him. Once I stumbled upon the send message dialog (still with the green unlocked UI element) somehow - no idea how. Otherwise, it's impossible. I can't add him using his number, or directly from contacts. I rebooted the phone and still can't add him from contacts or by using his number in +1xxxxxxxxxx format. I'll file separate UI bugs, but this is the whole story.

		What it says on the tin. This was always one of the biggest pain points with OTR. &quot;Secure session ended,&quot; or in OTR's case, something like &quot;your contact has disabled encryption. you should disable encryption on your side.&quot; You're a computer. How about you do it and provide me with a big warning box? In Textsecure's case, tapping &quot;secure session ended&quot; does nothing. Okay, now what? It should either offer to restart the session or, if doing so is for some reason inadvisable, explain that, and explain to the user what to do next.

I've TS configured to handle secure messages only (see http://abload.de/img/ts1eksfv.png and http://abload.de/img/ts2kxpzr.png) Last night I've got an encrypted (transport SMS, message colored grey) message from an unknown number (not in phonebook, don't know it at all). The session itself doesn't have the padlock and I only see the received message as &quot;Message encrypted for non-existing session&quot; with the padlock. When answering I've only unencrypted SMS (green arrow, padlock open) as choice so it seems that also the key exchange didn't happen. There is also no key for this number within &quot;Manage Identity Keys&quot;. I've created a contact with this number before asking back (unencrypted sms) who is writing from this number.

		There are a bunch of changes for the next release. Having the play changes notes translated would be of great benefit. @moxie0 could this be somehow exported from a ressource in strings.xml? If not would you mind posting the changes notes here, so that translaters could add translated versions here.

		@moxie0 @phenx-de Add preview of encryption channel in compose text hint. 6874714 and Add correct contextual menu options on 'Send' button. ea0fa58 both add information about how the message will be sent. I think they should be unified. And I would tend to unencrypted rather than insecure which sounds like &quot;not sure if this will be received&quot;?!

		@tinloaf While testing XML import on the latest branch (13. June) i encountered some contact photo issues. Did not get any error messages or logs. Same for KitKat (VM) and GB (emulator): [Edit: just reproduces an empty phot on my CM 11 device with these steps. Built it on 12.06. at 10:00 UTC ] clear conversation new message (plus symbol) change from contacts or type number (KitKat) (Gingerbread) After importing a larger XML this resulted in no contacts stored on the GB emu, so only Mr Open Mouth should show up: (clicked on line 2, and got the circle highlight) Scary, hu?

		Galaxy S4 i9505 Android 4.3 XXUENAA. TextSecure 2.0.8 Encrypted SMS are sent and received just fine with text secure option set to 'not handle all SMS'. Encrypted MMS send fine but will not be intercepted by textsecure unless option to 'handle all MMS' is set to on. With option off encrypted MMS are coming through stock android messaging app. Also even with textsecure set to 'handle all MMS' set to on sometimes there will be no notification of having received a MMS at all.

		At the moment the first title in the TextSecure settings is named &quot;Push and SMS&quot; although it refers to push messages, SMS messages and MMS messages. Push messages will also be renamed to &quot;TextSecure messages&quot; so this title needs to be replaced with something more appropriate. &quot;Sending and receiving&quot; maybe?

		I starting using this week. all of a sudden no SMS messages. Had to sign on the Textsecure to read message and reply. But reply was in Standard SMS [not secure] I went thru SET up and have changed it around so standard SMS message should remain in the clear and SecureText will remain in secure format. That is what I wanted in the first place..

		Hi, I'd like to compile my own version of TS without any data options like GCM. Basically I want to go back to a pure SMS based app like it used to be. Can someone point me in the right direction as to where in the source I should look to remove this functionality? Or anyone know of any existing forks that already do this? Thanks

		Using Android Studio 0.5.2 on 64bit Ubuntu 13.10 and following the instructions in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/BUILDING.md I have noticed that there seems to be an error with both Gradle 1.12 and 1.11 Specifically, when using Gradle 1.12 Android Studio throws the following error: Gradle 'TextSecure' project refresh failed: Cause: org.gradle.plugins.ide.internal.IdeDependenciesExtractor.extractRepoFileDependencies(Lorg/gradle/api/artifacts/ConfigurationContainer;Ljava/util/Collection;Ljava/util/Collection;ZZ)Ljava/util/List; This error was referenced here http://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2014/05/intellij-idea-13-1-3-update-is-available/ so I tried pointing to Gradle 1.11 and that didn't work either.

		I have had multiple issues with TextSecure not recognizing another TextSecure user and automatically initiating key exchange and encryption. It ends up working eventually after minutes or sometimes hours of trying, but in the meantime I'm getting charged for international SMS that I shouldn't be paying for. I am using TextSecure with a phone number in Suriname, and I have had issues trying to communicate with 2 users who have US phone numbers.

		I usually communicate with a friend of mine using textsecure, but she is out of country and has no internet connection at the moment. is it possible for me to write an (unencrypted) sms to her instead of a textsecure message, without changing my default settings in textsecure? i could not find such an option in the app. for the moment i just use another sms app for sending, but this seems not to be an optimal solution for this problem. my suggestion would be a context menu option when sending a message, where one can chose to send an sms just this once (with an appropriate warning maybe). in my opinion, the combined push/sms usage of textsecure fails to work for traveling people right now

		Hello, Just installed TextSecure in order to replace Viber, at least when communicating with certain people, but noticed some strange behaviour. If I send message along with some attachement (e.g. picture) and using Croatian native characters - čČ ćĆ đĐ šŠ žŽ - they are all displayed as ????? on the receiving end. However, if I send plain message (without any attachment) with the same native characters, everything is fine on the receiver end. Any hint? Sincerely, Gour

		Hi, I've got a new problem with adding new conversation/contact. When I add a new contact number, the contact apk put auto space every two numbers, if I want to open a new thread or receive a message of that contact, the number showed is with spaces. If I try to send a message to that number, it fail instantly. I'm pretty sure it's because of the spaces issue, I tried to start new thread, modify contact information, adding the number to open the thread : nothing worked. Thanks for reading.

		The &quot;yo&quot; app has shown that there is value in easily, quickly attracting the attention of another person via SMS. It seems to me that it would be (relatively) easy to implement this functionality in TextSecure. It would work like this: From the ConversationListFragment, a person selects one or more people In the action bar during batch selection, there will be a menu item &quot;YO&quot; When &quot;YO&quot; is pressed, TextSecure sends out the two-character text message &quot;Yo&quot; to all of the selected contacts via SMS

		Sorry if this was already reported somewhere, didn't find anything using the search. I just noticed that when you receive an image without any text in a message, the belonging notification just displays the sender but nothing else. WhatsApp solves this by displaying &quot;John Doe - Picture&quot;, so that you know what's going on. This probably concerns the other attachment types as well (didn't test it though). My suggest would be to follow the example of WhatsApp and just display the type of the received media.

		I've had an ongoing issue where I'll receive an image in a text message, but it will display as an image I had already received from another sender. The new image just never displays. Contact A sends me a picture of her kids. I can view it. Contact B sends me a picture, but the thumbnail is the same as the image from Contact A. I touch it to open it in my pictures. It opens as the picture from Contact A. Contact C sends me a picture. It comes through normally. Contact A sends another picture. It comes through as the picture from Contact C. Also, I've noticed that if someone sends a picture to a group, 99% of the time I get no thumbnail (just an empty box), and a &quot;Media not Found&quot; error when I try to open it.

After every update I have to remove TS and install it again because TS can´t exchange encrypted messages anymore. P.S. Needless to say this annoys my contacts when a new key exchange message is displayed. Thank you.

		Ability to delete the SIM or android address book and the textsecure app still be able to show the name of whom I'm texting. I'd love to be able to add a contact from textsecure and choose if I want it to be added to textsecure only as a nickname (for simple identification) or as a full contact in my address book. There are a lot of people I might contact once or twice and don't really want to fill up my address book with.. let's say the guy who bought my car The contact data to be held behind my passphrase in the textsecure database.

		I experienced this Problem with two Contacts in my List. They are unable to send me messages. Instead i get: &quot;Received corrupted key exchange message!&quot; and so do they, when I try to send a message to them. Ending the Secure Session via the Lock Symbol didn't change the Situation. This behavior started some time after I switched from Cyanogenmod 10 to Cyanogenmod 11 with a Factory Reset. But all other TextSecure Contacts except the two mentioned, kept working fine. I also refreshed the Push Directory several Times after the Error started to appear but it didn't change anything. Device Info: Nexus S, CyanogenMod 11-20140608-SNAPSHOT-M7-crespo

		At the moment sending of data messages fails if there is no internet connection. You are able to choose SMS fallback. I think it would be good to start queueing the message and send it when the internet connection is established again. We could add a little notice to the dialog which pops up when you tap the message for fallback. Something like: &quot;Your message will be sent when you have a internet connection again. If you don't want to wait, you can send a SMS now&quot; What do you think? edit: posted it in the mailing list now

		I am using TextSecure as my default app for text messages. However, there is a difference between TextSecure and other apps like my phones default or Hangouts: Using Hangouts or the default app of my phone, I can still access my messages via bluetooth. Third party apps like droidstats or airdroid are able to see the Messages and count them. Using TextSecure, droidstats does not &quot;see&quot; me sending messages and accessing my messages via Message Access Profile (Bluetooth) or Airdroid only yields messages of the time before I started using TextSecure. So I believe that TextSecure stores messages differently, though I don't know what the difference is and if it might be a design-decision (e.g. for security reasons). I see that those third-party apps would probably only work with unencrypted messages, but that would be fine for me. tl;dr: Is it possible to make messages sent and received by TextSecure available in the same way as &quot;the default apps&quot; do? I.e. that they are accessible via MAP or third-party apps, even though some of them might be encrypted. Disclaimer: I've not developed any app for android, so I have very little knowledge about how things work here and if there is a uniform way to store text messages.

		I recently changed from a Samsung GS4 to an HTC One M8, and I installed TextSecure as I loved it on the GS4. I tried to send my daughter a msg. (it showed her as already being a text secure user even before I sent a msg.) and the app crashes every single time. If I send unencrypted things to anyone (including her) it works fine.

		Since a few days, I am no longer able to send PUSH messages to a friend of mine. However, encrypted SMS are sent correctly. On the other hand, she can send messages over the data channel to me without any problem. We both re-registered for PUSH by unchecking and rechecking the option in the settings. I am also able to communicate with my other contacts over PUSH. Here is a log file of me sending her a test message: http://hastebin.com/funosuhoha.vhdl I am uncertain whether this is a client problem because the messages are shown to me as being correctly sent.

		I have received an unencrypted SMS but Text Secure thinks it is and says &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot;. Is there a way for me to get that SMS in clear text? btw: I think language selection should always be described in English too. I tried to switch to English to get the message from TS in English and hit Arabic by accident. It took me some time to find the language selection dialog again...

		Friend of mine told me over email he also uses TextSecure. I added his int'l phone number as a contact on my phone and then attempted to send him a message via TextSecure. 1st message I tried sending: Shows up as green/SMS - is not actually sent, gives me pop-under &quot;Tap for insecure fallback&quot;. I did not take the offer. Logs: http://hastebin.com/newuhiwaha 2nd message I tried sending: Shows up as blue/PUSH - but is never actually sent (dark blue, no timestamp). TextSecure crashed immediately after I hit the &quot;send&quot; arrow. Logs: http://hastebin.com/okinuwimeq 3rd message I tried sending: Exactly same behaviour as previous. Immediate crash. Logs: http://hastebin.com/usalowafus At this point I tried the option &quot;Refresh PUSH directory&quot; but it didn't seem to help - next message I tried sending to this new contact was followed by an identical crash. Now, two days later, I can communicate with this person just fine over PUSH, no crashes. I hope the logs give you something to go on. Let me know if I can provide any further info. Thanks a bunch for TS!

		When in a group chat someone sends two consecutive messages, the application displays two different bubbles with the text of each message, and displays the name of the contact twice. This takes away a lot of space, especially if you don't have a huge screen. It would be nice if the messages were merged into the same bubble, so to save some space. Thank you!

		Hi, I have a problem. Since I installed TextSecure, I can't edit my contacts any more. Let me explain. If I use the phone's default app to edit the name/surname of a contact (which I save on my sim card), and then reboot the phone, all the edits are gone. This started happening after I installed TextSecure, for some reason. It's obviously very annoying and it's kind of driving me crazy. Please fix it. Thank you

Android is rooted, I made sure all permissions are enabled via App Ops. http://hastebin.com/tunohisuta EDIT: BTW, TextSecure is set as standard SMS app.

		@moxie0, it seems AVAST is again declaring TextSecure aa potential Malware. Not sure you're about to explode now, but I wonder why TextSecure seems to be &quot;the target&quot;, again? If this shit won't stop soon and AVAST does not do something to their virus difinitions, I'll uninstall it. I'm curious if they have the balls to publish another apology or not. Feel free to recommend a better scanner, I'm already fed up with it! Thanks.

		Hej there, Today I accidentally killed my TextSecure app and after restarting and unlocking it a bunch (a lot of them, actually) of messages were missing. I think this should be all messages I received after unlocking it for the last time. Do they get written to the database only if the app is shut down correctly? Were are they in the meantime? Is this behaviour intentionally? Cheers Felix

		Platform: Moto G w/ 4.4.3 What happened: While logged out of textsecure I opened textsecure and then quickly hit the back button as it brought up the password prompt, the screen immediately flashed with the last conversation I'd viewed and then closed. Upon re-testing this trick basically allowed me to see the last couple screens that I had previously viewed in textsecure until finally starting to drop me back to the desktop directly. If you're not already aware of this I'm betting you'd want to be.

		It would be very nice to have less obvious way of notifying about incoming message. Now there's an information on status bar saying that there is a encrypted message with sender's name. Less obvious would be to be able to disable status bar message at all but to keep LED blinking and/or sound. As an alternative - changing status bar notification text to some simple icon would do the trick too. The icon would be more discreet than the whole notification text.

		Hi, I had to migrate my textsecure messages (export encrypted backup), but since I didn't have the time to migrate right after the backup I used textsecure for another week and did a new data export. When I tried to import the backup afterwards I first had some issues getting it unencrypted (but it finally worked), but the main problem is: all messages between the first backup and the second backup are gone! I guess textsecure doesn't manage to overwrite previous backups when trying to make a new one! Please fix it even though my messages will probably remain lost...

		I hope that I don't mention an old Topic again. Last week I set my phone to factory state, installed Textsecure and imported the backup. At first, it couldn't decrypt anything and crashed. After opening again, it works just fine. But: I sent push messages to a friend and she received them, but I didn't get her answers. Now, after deactivating and reactivating push Messages, it works again.

		When users uninstall textsecure with an active subscription to push service, this subscription is left over. There is no way to tell this from the senders point of view. They just won't answer anymore. You have to talk back to them to get to know that they have uninstalled textsecure. My suggestion is to unsubscribe from push automatically on uninstall and/or add receive notification for sent messages.

		I've been using a group message with two other TS users successfully for about a week. Today, one member appeared to leave the group. They could still send to the group and from their side, it looked like they were still in the group, but from both other participants, no messages were going through to the third person (K in the images). Messages from K to the group were seen by all, but messages from B and J were not delivered to K. Creating new groups with both the same and different participants had the same effect. K would leave the group upon sending of the first message from B or J. Screenshots are from B. K is using a HTC One X (ATT) with Android 4.1.1, HTC Sense version 4+, HTC SDK API 4.63. Here's K's log: http://hastebin.com/yimowizopu B is using Samsung Galaxy S4 (ATT) Android 4.4.2 Here's B's log: http://hastebin.com/pinojanive

		After my TS was stuck with incoming invisible messages, which stopped me from sendin and receiving anything (will open another bug for this), i exported an encrypted backup, then wiped the ts data from the android apps settings, when opening ts i entered a new (the same as before) password and imported the backup. All looked perfect at the first glance... just all my messages were unable to decrypt, plus those lost messages were in the right senders bin, but marked as not belonging to any conversation... Is there a way to restore this backup with all the messages decrypted? The crap is, that also a plaintext backup doesnt restore. I think there exists a closed bug that might fit about some unicode issues. I would be quite happy, if i could get my data back! Ts is latest from play store on a samsung i9070 on JB 4.1.2. I hope @moxie0 can do some magic for me :-P

		I searched but could not find an issue about this. The 6 letter number you are told when using the &quot;confirmation by call&quot; for the push registration is only said once. Unless you know that beforehand and write it down quickly or if you have a good talent of quickly memorising the numbers you are in a bad situation and will probably need to toggle another call. Please make the numbers be repeated at least once so slower people have a change of using that service successfully. Or announce them slower.

		I tried sending an unencrypted message to a TS user and I didn't run into any success. When I long press on send icon and select &quot;send unencrypted&quot; it just sent the message over push as encrypted (blue message with lock). http://hastebin.com/iwujaxibem

		Testsecure still crashes when trying to export an unencrypted backup. I am worried because I have no way to back up my text messages. I uploaded a debug log to http://hastebin.com/riwonataho immediately upon reopening after the crash. I am on an Xperia Z1s from tmobile. If you need additional info, I am happy to provide it.

		I don't know much about android apps, but when I switch to the activity, where I can send messages (chat activity) then sometimes the text box isn't focused. So when I type, nothing happens and I have to click on the text box. Maybe someone can fix this.

		Similar but I believe not technically identical to #1533. Have two numbers: SIP and SIM. Bind Textsecure to the SIP number. Send a encrypted SMS via Textsecure. This will use the SIM number. Receiver can not decrypt the SMS (as expected). I guess this is not a relevant issue for the short term. Nonetheless SIP is becoming more and more popular eg. with CyanogenMod having it integrated by default.

		I updated the application just now and the application seems to have completely lost the capability to send encrypted messages. The lock icon on the top right of the thread that allowed you to start an encrypted session has been completely removed. All of my conversations that were previously being encrypted have stopped being encrypted. Further, when the application is locked, the contents of the message is shown in plaintext in the notification area. I'm using a Galaxy S3 with Android 4.3

		When receiving SMS the message scrolls in plain text across the notification bar instead of showing encrypted message. Also when I pull down the notification bar to view notifications, an unread message appears in plain text. Note the app is already locked when this happens There are times the message does appear as encrypted but that is rare.

		Since the last update of TextSecure (2.1.1) I noticed something &quot;extrage&quot; but I thought was an optical illusion at first but I confirmed this. In the notification bar, you can see the message whithout encryption, in older versions the message was &quot;Encrypted Message&quot; now it showed the message in plain text. I erased the content of the message but as you see is a long message, is not encrypted and was shown in plain text in the notification bar but when I clicked the message... It's suppose to be blocked by password... Hope you could fix this issue...

		My phone was off while several messages were posted to a group conversation of textsecure users. (I know because one of my other devices using a different textsecure account is a participant in the group as well.) When I turned my phone back on, the messages were not pushed to it. Effectively, my phone missed out on part of the conversation because it was turned off. Is that by design, or is that a bug?

		For easier spread of TextSecure, it might be good to offer a menu item in unencrypted SMS conversations that starts the message editor with TextSecure's Google Play link (and maybe a text like &quot;Please install the following for encrypted communication:&quot;). The menu item should have a name like &quot;Ask for encrypted communication&quot;, although this might be too long.

		Okay, this is going to be a bad ticket without much detail, but I feel the obligation to document in at least some form. I have data, Jenny does not (I think). We've exchanged keys before and authenticated. At some point in the last couple months her phone stopped receiving any text secure messages from my phone, whereas I continue to get her messages. This does not occur between my phone and anyone else, but we did some experiments together on the two phones and were unable to get ours to work. Anyway, Lilia, you should poke at Jenny's phone the next time you're at Sudoroom. / halfassed bug report

		I created a group just to test how creating a group works. I added some random contacts that showed as TextSecure users. Then I decided, ok, creating groups works and went on with my day. Later I received a message from one of the users, inside the group, asking about the purpose of this group. At no point did TextSecure indicate or warn that the mere creation of a group was a &quot;transferred&quot; action. This lead me to leak the numbers of completely unrelated strangers to each others. Please add a warning or dialog that a group is immediately communicated to all participants, even with no message(s) sent.

		Until version 2.0.8 there was the lock symbol in the headline over the chat, where you could start a encrypted sesssion. Now since 2.1.0 the lock symbol is only in encrypted chats. Is it unnecessary bacause TS starts an encrypted push session automatically? And also encrypted sms? Or is it a bug?

		Setup: Have a contact with two Custom labels for their two phone numbers. Steps to reproduce: open any conversation with a user like above. Note: at the top of the conversation, it doesn't show that custom label next to the phone #. This affects me because I have contacts that have two cell #'s to which I can text. It also might be good to consider showing the custom label in the list of conversations.

		I have a Galaxy Note 3 running Kit Kat and recently updated to TextSecure v2.1.1. I have the app set to timeout the passphrase at five minutes. Since the update, if I leave the app unlocked, it will not ask for the passphrase even after remaining unlocked for hours. Manual lock works fine, so it's something wrong in the timeout.

		I'm not really sure if this is really a bug, but it looks for me like one. If I type in a secure SMS the maximal lenght is 60 characters. If that is exceeded multiple SMS are send (as far as I know). But if I write a TextSecure message the same limit of maximal characters is shown. To me, it looks a little bit strange to have such a low limit on the lenth of push messages. Or is it maybe a bug with my phone/android version in special? Phone: Xperia Arc S with Android 4.0.4

		Right now you have to choose, whether you want an enter button or the smileys-button on your keyboard. I've read some comments in the German Google play store, that people would like both possibilities (me included). I think an elegant solution to this would be, if both buttons are still in the keyboard, so we don't use space in the writing section like whatsapp. The functionality could work like this: With this feature there would also be no need for the section &quot;input settings&quot;. I don't know, if this was discussed earlier, I'm sorry if that is the case, but I couldn't find any issues concerning that feature.

		I recently downloaded and installed TextSecure because of, what I've heard, it's ease of use and security. But now that I have it installed on my phone I realised everything doesn't seem to work as easy as I thought for a newbie user as myself. My main problem is that for the moment, it seems like the TextSecure app can't recognise who among my contacts is a registered TS (push) user. I know at least one of my (international)friends is but when I tap on her number and want to send a message through data the only option that shows up is nonencrypted sms. Also, when I untick the box for sms to non-TS users non of the contacts are displayed when I tap the + icon. Is there something I have to do before I can send messages through data except registering for push or is there something I'm missing? Is there supposed the be some kind of notice if you send over data or via sms at all before you actually send the message and green/blue bubble shows up? I'm running the 2.1.1 version of the app on a G3, I went through the installation process without problems and have registered for push. I had to uninstall and then reinstall the app twice though because the app didn't recognise my password after I locked it. The timed lock feature seems to be broken too because after the set time no password is needed to unlock the app, not sure if that has anything to do with my problem but I thought I should mention it anyway. I'm pretty sure my friend is also running the 2.1.1 version.

		I sometimes have problems sending text message (sms). Sometimes the reason appears to be that the message is to long. When I split it, it then works, But this does not always appears to be the reason. I have found the logic yet, but I get the feeling, it might have something to do with German Umlauts or &quot;?&quot;. It is not really easy to recreate. Here my hastebin: http://hastebin.com/lazejozucu

		Textsecure allows you to set a message limit for conversations, similar to stock messaging apps. However, stock apps let you &quot;lock&quot; a message to prevent its automatic deletion when the conversation hits the defined limit. I would like to see this in textsecure, so then I can lock messages instead of saving the entire conversation.

		While I think this is an important feature, some people were opposed to self-destructing messages. I would take it even further and do similar to Gliph, where anyone in a conversation can delete messages. A risk with Gliph is their effectively central control*, which the TextSecure team seems to have solved very elegantly. * Gliph is quite transparent, and have what they call Lockdown™ Privacy Protection. Unfortunately, the fact remains they are in control of the infrastructure and could theoretically capture the passphrase next time you login. Meaning we have to trust them. Messages I send other people should disappear on my terms. The sender should have control over her messages, as she's the one providing the content after all. Without much insight into the project, I'd like to share my ideas. Let's hope they are of value. Scenarios to relate with Imagine two journalists discussing some political issue over TextSecure, and one of them loses track of their phone. Say this journalist didn't care immensely and neglected security in a way that his messages are now available to read for anyone in possession of his phone. If the journalist's friend could trigger the phone to delete sensitive messages—provided the phone can reach the Internet—they could rest more peacefully. In case you are not a top secret agent, something easier to relate to may be sending a message to the wrong person. If you realize you've sexted your family like around 10% in a poll by Recombu have you may want to have an undo button. (how do people accidentally do this?) Friends and collegues I care quite a bit about privacy and security, and although I've managed to make my friends care more than expected, there is a limit to what they'll endure. This suggestion would ease the pressure on them to control their habits. They won't use a very secure password if they have to enter it every time to read messages. Implementation complicatedness Putting this idea together into the product can get complicated. Should the recipient have the ability to disallow deletion? As he could already be in possession of the information, one could argue it may already be captured and that my idea gives a false sense of security to the sender. I think it's an issue with little impact to an otherwise very valuable feature. Anyway, if we let the recipient prevent such deletion, I would like the sender to be aware of that fact before submitting her message. If the recipient doesn't agree with letting the sender delete their messages or having them expire, he could disable it for future messages. The recipient may have the ability to disallow deletion/expiry for (specific or all) senders, but the sender must always be aware of which before sending. All this causes complexity and new UI considerations. It appears we do not want more of that. Everyone should easily understand their message's fate. Solution Let the sender delete it's own contribution to the conversation. Allow manual locking of messages as suggested in #283. That's a simple and in my opinion reasonable compromise resulting in an easy to understand model avoiding added complexity. Model Messages are owned by the sender, who can always delete them, but is also aware that removal from other devices (or human memories) cannot be guaranteed. User interface We have the following alternatives for deletion. Delete message or conversation... ...from current device only. ...from current device and send deletion notice for own messages to other parties. ...from current device and send deletion notice to other parties, regardless of sender. ...from other parties only, by sending a deletion notice. Potential problems How can messages be kept track of, and could this kind of ownership break the plausible deniability we currently enjoy? Would the ability to delete any message in a conversation solve that problem? Future considerations Let any party delete any message People should manage to handle this as a social issue, where if someone disrespects the wishes of message retention, they're reprimanded appropriately. TextSecure has no role in this. Expiring messages (requires UI modification) Perhaps auto-deletion after recipient specified time period suits better for TextSecure. Related issues #175, #176, #226, #283. I love that Signal was just released for iPhone!

		There is contact X and contact Y using TextSecure. X and Y used to send each other TextSecure messages but recently, things changed. X can still send TextSecure messages to Y. Y can receive them but is not given the possibility to send back TextSecure messages to X (the interface is offering secure SMS). The following is the story about how I fixed it and probably also contains the cause of the error: After searching for a while I noticed the following on Y's phone: When pressing &quot;+&quot; to start a new conversation, X was presented as TextSecure User with his phone number +49170854----. After clicking on the contact item of X, the conversation view opened and now on the top of the screen the was X name and below his phone number +490170854---- (note the additional 0 after the country code). Now I searched the phones local phone book for that number. It was quite a mess with the +49170-number being part of at least two contacts. And then I found the +490170-number, which was part of a Skype-contact and could not be edited. I asked X to delete the additional 0 from his Skype-account. Then I deleted the local Skype-contact entry in Y's phone book. After I cleared data and cache of TextSecure on X's device and on Y's device and re-registered both to the TextSecure push-service, everything worked again. Debug logs (a bit messy): X's phone: http://hastebin.com/iwipawemob Y's phone: http://hastebin.com/xakubapiro

		I know it's not a common case, but maybe this helps tracking down, why sometimes messages get lost. I had to uninstall my TS debug build because it deleted my keystore. I backed up TS data directory uninstalled TS installed new build started TS and closed when installation wizards showed up restored data restarted TS --&gt; sending and receiving works fine but later I was told that I should have received a few messages which i did not Is about 17 hours now and the messages did not show up yet. So I wonder if they are deleted, already fetched or still in queue? Logs are error-free. I can provide the sending and receiving numbers to moxie.debug@whispersystems.org.

		I noticed a strange issue: I created a group recently with a couple of members, all except one received their invitation and are able to communicate within the group. Concerning one user, I got a notification (that I cannot remember) indicating a problem delivering the invitation. The current situation is as follows: This user is listed among the group members, such that I cannot add him again. The user never received an invitation and can therefore not see / join the group. Obviously, the user can not leave the group, such that I cannot add him again. I have a couple of suggestions here :) It would be good if at least the creator of the group would be able to delete users from the group (also useful in case a wrong user was accidentally added). It would also be great to be able to resent the invitation (this could be done automatically possibly?) Thanks, Tobi

		TextSecure uses spell checking for entered text. Unfortunately, it offers only English word corrections even if the keyboard language and the text is in German language. The setting for language is also German. Interface language appears correctly in German. I assume this is a bug in TextSecure. I have HTC One and Android 4.4.2 with HTC Sense 6.0 TextSecure 2.1.4

		I have an issue sending and receiving mms. I know there are a lot of mms issues, but I couldn't verify if any of them were the same as this one. This issue is not affected by wifi connectivity or manually overriding the apn settings. Logcat (I added a few lines from the system log): http://hastebin.com/iqupawuyug.avrasm What happens is this: Enable mms radio Try to connect without proxy times out, in the meantime the mms radio connectivity is shut down by a timeout Try to connect with proxy fails because we're not connected with the mms radio My operator is tele2 in sweden and they require mms proxy.

		When working at the computer it can be annoying to switch back and forth between your phone, especially when there are active group messages. I would very much like a HTTP interface on the device (perhaps wifi only, only on whitelisted networks) that allows viewing of all messages and ability to send new ones, protected by the decryption password. Something like MightyText but not on a central server.

		Every time I have multiple apps displayed in my &quot;recent apps&quot; and swipe away TextSecure, the &quot;recent apps&quot; view closes (crashes), even if the &quot;list&quot; is displaying more recent apps. To view my recent apps again, I have to press the &quot;recent apps button&quot; twice instead of once. This only happens when swiping away Text Secure, not with other apps. I have version 2.1.4 installed, but the same thing happened with previous versions. Nexus 5, Android 4.4

		Hello, I am a huge supporter of securtext, I simply have a suggestion to make. I think its important to be able to clear screen or burn certain messages after the other person has viewed them. If its a secure conversation it will inusure the sender that the reciever would not be able to show anyone at a later date.

		Hello, It's the second time i post something here so i don't really how the thing goes but i got several thing i would like to adress regarding the app. If i need to open several thread i will :) Usually i don't experience problem with push message but at the moment one of my contact is in China ( i'm in europe) and it appear quite often that messages are delayed (in comparison to whatsapp). The second problem is that when the message is finally delivered - 5-15 minute later- the order is mixed up (eg: a message sent at 12:00 will be after one sent at 12:01). I believe it is more server sided and a connectivity problem but i wanted to address it even though i have no proposition to fix that. There is a total non-sense in the UI with a sliding panel on the left and the option menu. In my sense they should be only one; lets say the sliding menu as it's trendy at the moment hence the option button could trigger the slide. I could be nice to have the media button directly in the conversation ( e.g: next to the lock) and not in the menu. Regarding media again i have only access to the gallery not the camera ( but might be my cellphone the problem ). Hence it could be more comfortable to share &quot;stuff&quot; if there was a camera option next to the gallery one. 5)Still regarding the media; I saw it has been already noticed but as it hasn't changed since.... : pictures compressions are too heavy. I understand that bandwidth is expensive but the picture are not &quot;readable&quot; like that. I think that's all and hope i wasn't too negative as i really enjoy the app :) regards,

		This is just an idea for your plans to merge RedPhone and TextSecure into Signal. The way SAS and key continuity are used to verify identities in ZRTP are much more user friendly than identity verification in TextSecure (QR codes, etc). By folding both apps together, as it seems to be your plan, maybe you could reuse identity verification from &quot;RedPhone&quot; for &quot;TextSecure&quot;?

		The side bar in TextSecure has only two entries left and since a menu exist those two remaining entry could also be put in the menu. But also the other way would be a possibility, to remove the menu and put all entries into the side bar. When the latter the entry &quot;New Group&quot; could also move into the Action Bar.

		Hey, Since the first textsecure version I can`t receive push notification when I only get internet by mobile network. Only with wlan I receive messages. But when I send messages to my friends while mobile data is activated they receive my message. I'm using a Nexus 5 with the german eplus network. Another nexus user (nexus 4) in my friendlist has the same issue. I tried the app &quot;push notification tester&quot;. Wlan has passed the test. Mobile data creates this error in the debug log: &quot;--------- beginning of /dev/log/main D/Push Notification Tester(19259): Step 1: Subscribe start W/ContextImpl(19259): Implicit intents with startService are not safe: Intent { act=com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTER (has extras) } android.content.ContextWrapper.startService:494 com.firstrowria.pushnotificationtester.activities.MainActivity$2.onClick:136 android.view.View.performClick:4438 D/Push Notification Tester(19259): Step 1: registering to push updates failed, error code: SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE, registrationId: null, unregistered: null&quot; I hope someone can help me.

		There is a counter for written characters at the bottom of editing screen for new message. After &quot;0/63 (1)&quot; counter vanishes. Please add counter funcionality continuing after 63 characters. In Germany one text can contain 160 characters. So optimal counter would continue from &quot;0/160 (1)&quot; to &quot;160/160 (2)&quot; This seems to me to be a bug, because (1) could indicate number of texts. -&gt; this helps people like me who still have to pay for each text seperately. With text secure its not possible to have control over text message costs. For me this is why I am still not using text secure as standard app. I think the code change will be just a few lines but would be a great improvement. Thank you m0xie and team for this wonderful software. Thank you for contributing your free time for our privacy. device info: motorola A953, CM Android 4.4.4, Text secure 2.1.5, I am push registred.

		Hi, after having much fun with TextSecure for a long time it stopped working today. The visual issues are: 1.) when I send a PUSH/secure SMS message it stays in status pending. Insecure messages can be sent and received. 2.) when I restart my phone before entering the TextSecure passwd I see a notification of TextSecure &quot;4 new messages&quot;. After login to TextSecure test messages from other users are not shown 3.) In Android System Info Pro I see that the TextSecure process runs at 50 %. The battery is drained by TextSecure and the phone heats up significantly. 4.) TextSecure UI is very slow. All new encrypted messages Push or secure sms only show &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot; but that are never displayed in clear text. Any hint how what I can do to make it working again?

		Hello, I wonder if you have any documentation of how to assemble a &quot;TextSecure&quot; server for those who have basic knowledge. I've been looking at some documentation but found it very basic for those who do not have much experience and now be starting with that. I really enjoyed the privacy it offers us, I would mount a server here in my financial company, would assure some conversed data ... I also wonder what operating system (ubuntu) I can use, how to run the server and align with the application ... if you can help me somehow I thank you! Google Translate (im from brazil).

Person C, who was not involved in communication between Person A and Person B and is not using TextSecure, sent unencrypted MMS to Person B the following day. When Person B opened it an image of Person A, deleted previous day, appeared in a thumbmail of MMS from Person C. When Person B opened this image in other application, correct picture of Person C appeared. A bug again?

		I am running the latest version of TS on the latest version of SlimKAT on my Nexus 5. Since a recent update I'm not getting ANY messages from textsecure users anymore. I can send messages, but don't receive any. This is VERY urgent, because I missed like 20-30 messages without knowing in the last 2 weeks. I don't have any other sms-app installed (not even the standard one). I receive messages on every other messaging app (whatsapp, telegram, threema, skype). Normal/encrypted SMS are received fine through TextSecure. Text Messages aren't received at all.

		I've had an issue for a few months now where in low signal conditions (got signal, just not reliably) TextSecure has issues sending sometimes and near-immediately fails, or fails after telling me it'll try when there's signal. I believe this complete log (twitter/gps data redacted) shows two failures and a success of the same message: https://gist.github.com/JamesHarrison/6c9666e5a8f085e6d032 Had a look at it and I can't figure it out but looks like perhaps the unregistration method on a pending text is failing a bit too enthusiastically?

Strangely enough, it only worked once for the S5 (Received picture from the S5), then any future messages have errors. (Only had been 30 seconds between messages.) I also tried manually setting the MMSC url to http://mms.vtext.com/servlets/mms... Does not work. Here's my log. http://hastebin.com/tibuxokite

		Hey, Just a comment regarding the session setup. I sent a key exchange request after TS detected the sending party was using TS. Nice. However, even though I have &quot;Complete Key Exchanges&quot; ticked, the received key was not processed (and since I got about 10-12 messages in one burst, the topmost (the remote key material), was out of sight, while all the others were still encrypted, with the &quot;encrypted with an existing session&quot; (or something like that :-) message). Of course, as soon as I scrolled up and found the key exchange response message (&quot;key&quot; icon) and clicked on it, everything was fine. I do believe this will be confusing to new users, though. Just two cents, keep up the good work! /TB

		Currently, when a new device is set up this disables any old ones, presumably to increase security. However, due to how this is handled in details this IMHO has pretty serious security implications: It makes it much easier to take over an account for prolonged periods. If someone gets access to the SIM for even just a second they can connect to that phone number. They then will receive messages directed to that number. The legitimate user will however not be warned of this in any way. He will get generic &quot;sending failed&quot; messages. Worse, if encrypted SMS fallback is enabled, he might not even notice anything is wrong. The recipient will get these messages, but they will not be decrypted, thus making it even easier for the attacker to appear legitimate. Even if the user figures out that someone took over his account, there is no obvious way to fix this. The only one I could figure out is clearing app data, however then he loses his private key and the people he communicates with have no reason to trust him over the attacker. It makes it impossible to securely and with little effort switch to a new device. Normally this would be done by distributing a hash of the new private key via the old trusted channel. However before linking the new device its private key/hash is not known (I have not tried if skipping linking a phone number at first would be possible and help), whereas once the linking is done the old device can't be used to distribute the new hashes.

		With regards to #1705 I would propose automatic daily backups. There things to consider: If a person has not set up a passphrase, would an automatic backup be of security concerns? That would introduce the need for another UI-element, which is not an option when sticking to the development ideology. And only having automatic backups after setting up a passhprase is opaque. So I guess the best solution would be to bring in Flock: Let's enable automatic backups only if Flock is present and in a way that only Flock can access the (maybe unsecured) backup-data.

		If I understand the current status correctly, the Android version of TextSecure uses GCM exclusively. According to the GCM documentation, only 100 messages will be stored if the receiving device is offline; if that limit is exceeded, all queued messages will be deleted: http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/adv.html#lifetime Is this currently handled on the server side, or could messages potentially be lost? Could the iOS store-and-forward implementation be used to solve that problem?

		Didn't find anything like in the issues. I opened a group with a 4 other receivers. I sent a message member A sent a message member S did not receive member A's message (and was confused about the next messages the others wrote) ONLY member A receive a key message from member S x I wrote a few texts member N sent a message member S did not receive member A's message (and was even more confused about the next messages the others wrote) ONLY member N received a key message from member S (and was confused about the next message the others wrote) Couldn't get them to post logs... :( But to me it looks as if member S had not communicated with A and N after (some time ago) reinstalling TS. This really needs to be fixed/changed! This was one of my attempts to promote TS and - sadly - it failed. Even the tech nerd (not me) in the group found this very annoying.

		I am using SMS on purpose because I have found it to be more reliable than push on my phone's network. I keep getting a text secure nag screen popup asking me to use push. Please remove this nag screen completely, or add a checkbox to permanently hide it. I appreciate all of the hard work put into text secure, but users shouldn't be nagged to use push.

		Auto delete messages I'd like to request that feature again because many people already requested it in some issues, but there were some privacy concerns and it could be interesting to talk about them and maybe, after finding a good solution, to implement the feature! ;) So the idea is that messages automatically get deleted from the phones somehow. The suggestion that someone could delete the message from all phones remotely let some privacy concerns come up as you should have full control about which messages get deleted from your phone and which do not... Another idea (what I do appreciate) is the option to disable history like it's possible on hangouts (messages get deleted after some time automatically). For example messages get automatically deleted 24 hours after you read them. This could be an option in the conversation itself and you get the message &quot;history turned off&quot;. Every participant should have the option to turn it off/on and it applies for all the participants. Like that there's no confusion and all people in the conversation should be happy with this solution and can turn it on/off like they want to do. The messages should of course have another color if history is turned off ;) I do like this feature, the only privacy concern could be that you can still capture screenshots of it, but maybe taking screenshots could generally be disabled in the app or you get a notification that someone took a screenshot (what should be possible somehow because it works on snapchat e.g., too, right?). Do you think this would be possible or do you have some other concerns? Is such a function too hard to implement or would you even like that feature? :)

			<description>
		Hi, I got a message (via push, i.e. by a sender using TextSecure with encryption), that makes TextSecure take a long time to open or scroll over the senders entry in my message list (about 20seconds on my Moto G running CyanogenMod). If I try to open the conversation with said sender, it takes even longer and (more than two minutes). Often it just crashes while trying to preview. Once I managed to actually see the message. It looked like lots of encrypted data that TextSecure did not decode but showed it as text. I could not copy the message, as TextSecure crashed some seconds later (see log [1]) Sometimes TextSecure even crashes when trying to preview the senders message in the general (see log [2]). When save my messages via plaintext export, the problematic message does not show up. Thus I don't know how to pass it to you. Do you have any advice? By the way, as TextSecure crashes when showing the message, I have no idea how to delete the message to make TextSecure work again. Do you have any ideas? My device data: Motorola Moto G Cyanogenmod 11-20140504-SNAPSHOT-M6-falcon Android 4.4.2 If you need any other information, I will be happy to provide it.

		Love textsecure, been using it for years. Got a little feature request. I'm a sysadmin, about to be in the company's on-call rotation. We get nagios alerts sent to our phones via emailing the carrier's email-to-text service. Is it possible to export my public key for textsecure so I can use it to run a script on our nagios servers which calls gpg, uses my public key to encrypt the message contents, and then sends the encrypted message via my carrier's email-to-text service, and have it automatically decrypted in textsecure, even though there's been no key exchange via textsecure's api? Is this already possible and I just don't know how? Thanks guys, really love this program, and really looking forward to the ios port (my gf's on an iphone, and we're loving Signal, can't wait for encrypted messaging, too).

		Just a little Feature request. My Problem is, that i want to synchronize the Message Backups to my Home Computer. When I was using normal SMS and SMSBackup, all the output files were written into a subdirectory which was easy to synchronize but TextSecure writes the Backup File directly into the root of the sd card which I cant synchronize automatically because the sync software only supports folders and not single files. My question is: Is it possible to place the Backups per default in a subdirectory or to add an option where the backup directory can be set?

		Friends who are using TextSecure have found it frustrating that it alerts them every time they want to view an image. Even if they have the passphrase option disabled it still prompts them. My &quot;I'm totally an artist&quot; mockup: But I'd recommend the box being unchecked by default and an option in settings to reenable the alert.

		When I get a message containing only (or almost only) a phone number and I want to delete it this is quite difficult. When I long press the message, Textsecure both shows the upper toolbar with the delete button and I get a complete action dialog box from Android offering several ways to call the number (phone, skype, strangely not Redphone which I have also installed). When I press back to remove this dialog and then press the delete button it does nothing (well, at leat it does not delete the selected message). It doesn't show any message or error.

		A friend of mine could never get TS secure to work on their Huawai Android 4.3 system. I had exchanged some messages with them. After they uninstalled TS on their phone, my TS kept thinking they were using TS and kept sending all messages as encrypted. I.e. they always got garbled text instead of the message. I had to select 'End Secure Session' to stop this. The latter should happen automatic somehow.

		I am only writing this as a bug because it's unclear if I need to run TS on cyanogen. Specifically I am on CM11 m9 (m10 soon), I read somewhere that CM incorporates TS functionallity for both CM users and TS users. Currently I am using only TS, but if can roll back to the CM messenger and still have private conversation with TS users. Well, that would be good to know. Please help clarify.

		Some iota of intelligence or integration in Textsecure with systems running whisper-push (CyanogenMod) would be amazing. My interpretation of this stance here is by lack of integration and support directly from whispersystems is that whispersystems would prefer its users use textsecure app and NOT whisperpush... However this isn't explicitly stated, but seems to be implied

		Hi, TextSecure should detect if WhisperPush is enabled in the system (did not check how - I guess you can somehow read arbitrary system settings with the right permissions) and then warn the user to switch it off (and instead enable push messages in TS). Here's why: It's actually possible to install TS on a system with WhisperPush as long as you don't turn on push messages. Obviously that makes little sense, but users might still do it, and it leads to a mess, as stated in #1925 .

		TS is awesome, but one feature missing fromthe stock messenger app is the ability to lock a message withing a thread. As you know, in the stock messenger (well on CM11) I can lock messages from friends with pics, dates to remmeber, etc. and if I try to delete the entire thread. Those messages are not deleted and remain after everything else in the thread is. TS should support this to be a total messager replacement.

		I'm noticing that textsecure is picking up all mms messages that are being sent to my regular messages app. I've tried installing 3rd party sms apps, and have the same results. Edit: The best example I can give is also with group messaging with stock messages on Verizon Galaxy S4. It is set to send group as mms. When the others in the group reply it will go to textsecure and give me an error &quot;Unable to connect to MMS provider&quot; and sometimes the messages will come through to Messages app and others they just get stuck and never come through.

The two options on long press are push and insecure sms. How can a non-numeric sender id be registered with the push service? Or is it a bug?

		I'm new to using TextSecure and I'm sorry if this is a dupe but I couldn't find a similar issue. I just made TextSecure my default messaging app and when trying to download an MMS image, I receive &quot;Error connecting to MMS provider...&quot; I used the following manual MMS settings, as found in my phone's system menu (##3282#): MMSC URL: http://mmsc.vmobl.com:8088 MMS Proxy Host: 68.28.31.2 MMS Proxy Port: 80 A debug log can be found at http://hastebin.com/idofelenev I think the log cut off the attempt to download MMS with the proxy, but in previous attempts it looked similar.

		I am aware of the decision to fade out SMS/MMS support for security reasons. Unfortunately, I still need to (unsafely) communicate with people with &quot;feature phones&quot;. (Think: older people that do not want to (or cannot) use a smart phone.) Currently groups with such people are created as MMS groups. Would it be possible to create SMS groups instead? MMS are expensive for me, and I have an SMS flat rate.

		I have recently imported old chatlogs and now have a contact for which the chatlog spans several years. When opening the chatview of that contact there is a noticable delay. Also when sending and receiving messages (it's the only contact where I can see the &quot;encrypted message&quot;-placeholder now and then). I use a Moto G (Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 1GB RAM). When exporting the plaintext chatlog it's 4MB in size and contains about 7500 messages for that contact.

		In Korea, most of carriers are providing anti-SMS phishing service by default. This service puts &quot;[Web발신]\n&quot; prefix to SMS body when they are sent through automated sending service. As a result, TextSecure app cannot recognize received verification code due to it only matches message begins with &quot;Your TextSecure verification code: &quot; (https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/service/SmsListener.java#L129). I think this matching filter should include wildcard in front of word &quot;Your&quot; or Throw away everything except last line and filter with them. Here is screenshot of message which I received.

		I've been compiling TextSecure for a while now, since @moxie0 has been nice enough to gradle it all together. Today, I noticed new requirements/dependencies for the gradle build for v2.1.8. It specifically calls for com.google.android.gms:play-services:5.0.89. As a gapp-less user, will this cause issues with installation? Am I doing something wrong that I need these dependencies? If they are now required, what potential issues does this raise? Thanks

Unfortunately I happen to spend a lot of time in places where the internet connection isn't so good, and this is often a problem. For example: I send a message to the 5 other members of the group; While the application is sending the message to the 3rd recipient, the 1st already has the message and answers back; Since the internet connection of the 1st is better than mine, the 4th and 5th recipients often get the 1st's message before mine -- that is, they see the message with the answer before the message with the question. Is anything being done to improve the speed of messages sent in group chats? It's not only slightly annoying, it's also causing many problems because it's not so easy to understand &quot;who is answering which message&quot; when messages come in the wrong order. Thank you

		Hi, I have the stock Android 4.4 on a Motorola Moto G and my friend has Cyanogen Mod with TS as standard SMS app. We used it before on another phone, so now he has a different key. Mine however stayed the same. I can't tell my TS to switch his key. He also doesn't receive my messages (they're probably encrypted with the wrong key? Our numbers stayed the same). I do receive his though. I also receive messages with a key symbol and TS tells me that this might mean that someone's trying to intercept messages (I don't remember the exact message). Anyway, so I tried to end the secure session and it said session cancelled but I guess it didn't really cancel it because the &quot;cancel secure session&quot; didn't disappear. My friend send me his new key via QR-code by email and when I wanted to verify it, I got the message, that this is not the same key. Well, I knew that ...;) Is there a way to delete his key on my phone and start a new encrypted converation? Does it have something to do with me using the App from Google Play and him using the integrated CM app? Why can't I cancel the secure session? Shouldn't that always be possible? thanks!

		Groups that are visible in the regular conversations view are not found when searching for their names. Its probably the same issue that has been pointed out here http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/8473126-can-t-see-send-to-groups I am quite sure that this was not the case back in July. If I recall correctly then it was also possible to find the groups in the contacts screen (the one that pops up when hitting +). Device info: HTC Desire HD, Cyanogenmod 7.3, TextSecure 2.1.8

		Hey, I just reached for my blinking mobile (Nexus One, MIUI 2.3.23, Android 2.3.7) to read a TextSecure message. TS has been restarted (it asked for my passphrase) and after entering that, I see TS has lost all my messages but the newly received one (which is from a group now called Unnamed group). Unlike last time, I did not restart my phone, and instead tried to get some logging data out. I have no USB cable with me unfortunately. On a terminal (on device) as root I tried logcat | grep -E &quot;TextSecure|whispersystems&quot;, but all I got was W/PartProvider( 2725): Got master secret: org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.MasterSecret@406b92a0 (... or so... beware, I typewrote that) So I guess the ringbuffer is already emptied, meh. Do you know of any way of getting my messages and pictures back? Can I supply you with more information so we can get to the cause of this? Losing the TS database happened to me once before; Last time, I put the blame on the failing battery and subsequent file system recovery. This time, it just happened like that. Of course I tell all my friends to keep backups, of course I have none. So maybe it's just Karma. Meh.

		Currently TextSecure requires the verification SMS to be exactly Your TextSecure verification code: NNN[N]-NNN[N]. But some mobile carriers apparently append or prepend a certain text to the original SMS. The relevant portion of the verification code should accept them as well. In my particular case, Korean carriers have prepended [Sent from Web] to every SMS sent from non-mobile devices as a (poor) countermeasure to SMS spams, and TextSecure simply misses them. While this (dis)service is optional, it is opt-out and many Korean users are likely affected.

		When using TextSecure as SMS replacement app, there occurs an issue if one contact tries out TextSecure but then decides to go back to some other IM. Then TextSecure always pre-selects sending a secure push message - which will never arrive because the contact no longer uses TextSecure. So either one should be able to set the default communication channel for TextSecure contacts back to unsecure SMS, or at least TextSecure should remember the last communication channel per contact and default to that for the next message.

		nexus 5 android 4.4.4 push TS 2.1.8 sometimes when i receive photos as attachments they don't download, they thumbnail stays in download mode forever, force quitting and starting again doesn't help. i'm suspecting it can be caused by a handover from data-wifi or vice versa, where the internet connection drops for a bit. i frequently (dis-)connect to wifi networks. my contacts complain about the same problem, i have to re-send photos that show the completed status on my side. so the sender has no indication that the delivery failed. log might be too new :( http://hastebin.com/loduruqiga

		@moxie0 It seems that a per contact user setting storage may be a good idea for the future, as feature implementations such as per contact notification sounds continue to be implemented. Rather than see this fragmented across many different type specific databases it would seem creating a generic db for this task may be desirable. Would you agree? I have made some modifications that would require this type of storage as well for implementing a MRU (most recently used) transit type for messages instead of automatically defaulting to Push. But before creating yet another database in the factory I wanted get your opinion on the matter.

That's so small, that it's almost useless to even start with Video editing to get it down to this size.

		Hello, I have a problem. My internet provider slows my phone's connection after I reach 1GB of data. It slows it so I can't go faster than 30KB/s, but that's better than nothing. The problem is that although I am able to use other messaging applications (internet is slow, but still works), TextSecure doesn't send messages. At all. I do receive them, but I can't send them. They never go from the dull blue to the bright blue. And what's even worse is that even if after I connect the phone to a WiFi, it won't send those messages. Any ideas? I know I could send SMSs, but I'm looking for a solution and not a workaround. Thank you

		ISSUE: On one of three phones of our family, Text Secure (TS) is not working: First, after setting-up TS it connected to push-messages however, phone could only communicate with another phone with secure message in one direction (sending) but couldn’t receive from any of the other two. Checked to use number with country code, enabled Gapps, rebooted; no luck. Tried to disable push-messages and received error: “Error connecting to server!” Deinstalled TS and reinstalled it again. Now, the phone cannot register with TS at all. Registration fails, because phone does not receive any sms with the required code from TS server, instead error message appears with something like &quot;Network connectivity error ...&quot; and TS recommends registration with call message. When doing it, registration code is noted and when enter, TS tells us &quot;Network connectivity error ...&quot; and registration fails. Updated to latest TS 2.1.9 and still the same issue. I’ve reported it on Support Centre here: http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/8356686-can-t-disable-push-messages-un-register-from-textsecure- And was asked to post it on issue tracker. DEVICE INFO: First used TS 2.1.6, updated to TS 2.1.9, Nexus4, Android KitKat 4.4.4 CONNECTION: Data (like the other two phones, which do work) APP STATE: Default settings DEBUG LOG: Issue on TS 2.1.9: http://hastebin.com/qinudigafi Issue on TS 2.1.6: http://hastebin.com/quzuvigugi

		Dear TextSecure develop team, I am a honest user and a developer based on your source code. There are some problems while I am using the TextSecure app recently.

1.  We can send the push message and sms message if we change another simcard which is not the same as the register number. But there will be some problems if we send a secure sms message, cause the simcard number is not the same as the register number, besides that, it will leads to anther secret key exchange, if we exchange it again the new received message or secure sms message seems crupt and can not be decrypt in our app.
Reproduce steps:
1) register with number 180.....
2) remove the simcard and insert anther simcard
3) send a secure message to a friend in our contacts
4) send a sms messgae to the same number above
5) send a secure message to the same number above
you can find some problems here...

2. Can not choose which simcard to send the sms message with a dural sim cards support phone, so my question is can we support the dual simcards phone both can send secure message?

I am waiting for your help, thanks!

		Most other text messengers have a small icon on each message which shows status (send, received, read). Espacally the update whether a user has read a message is very helpful. I miss this feature in TextSecure. Because of the traffic, this feature shouldn't be available for SMS.

		I'd love the ability to use Signal/TextSecure as my primary messaging app, but the lack of multi-device syncing is holding me back. At the same time, I know that most services that offer multi-device syncing (Hangouts, iMessage, etc) do so by storing your keys in the cloud, making your communications snoopable. So, I think it would be cool if I could get multi-device syncing from WhisperSystems apps, through directly transferring my secret key from one device to another, for example through NFC or WiFi direct. This might call for decoupling WhisperSystems IDs from PSTN phone numbers.

		I have a contact who switched over to a new phone without backing up its old key. So he generated a new key. When I first chatted with him I saw that TextSecure exchanged keys again but he doesn't get my messages now and when he tried to write to me i just saw &quot;bad encrypted message&quot;. I tried to close the encrypted chat and things but nothing works. now we can't chat anymore. The same problem happened to another friend some months ago. He got frustrated and deleted TextSecure, so the problem got fixed for him too, in a bad way... using WhatsApp ;)

		Currently, when send-via-data fails, e.g. because there is no internet connectivity, TextSecure will mark the message light green and offer to fallback to SMS (&quot;tap to ...&quot;). There is no way back to a light blue message / send-via-data, even if the internet connection comes back online. TextSecure should immediately and automatically retry to send-via-data, as soon as the internet connection is back online. This should be made visually obvious, e.g. by keeping the light blue background instead of switching to light green, or by adding a spinning circle icon.

		One of the reasons for the refusal to publish an apk outside Google Play was the lack of a good update channel. I noticed that the newer versions of Lucky Patcher seem to handle this just fine (that program is banned on Play because it can remove ads from other programs), the author is on XDA so perhaps his code can be borrowed to implement such an update function.

		Hello, sometimes it happens to me that TS doesn't send messages. The bubble of the message never turns &quot;dark blue&quot;, you know? I am correctly connected to the internet and all the other apps work fine. What's worse is that the stuck message seems to prevent future messages from being sent, too. I have to reboot (just deleting the message not being sent doesn't work), and it's very annoying as many times I don't even realize until hours later -- because I rely on the &quot;background sending&quot;... bad idea. Unfortunately I don't have a debug log (I will post one when it happens again), but I was wondering if this is a known bug...? Thank you

		We use 2 phones with textsecure and both crashes immediatly when you try to open a sms or textsecure message. It is no longer possible to use the application. We used it now for about a year without problems... Android 2.3.6, Motorola Pro+ Even reboot, stop and new start, deleting all data, etc has no effect. Thx Maik

		After upgrading my VM I was able to send messages, but didn't receive for a few minutes. After those few minutes all messages were received, but as bad encrypted. (Even delivery receipts were shown as bad encrypted messages?!) Had to manually end the session to make it work. Self texting is not working. I was able to end the secure session, but then all new key messages are shown as corrupt. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/edbb008e29162aec10de destination ending on xxx34 are self texting As the log is quite long I guess the v3 build starts at about line 500

		Hello, I have to report a weird bug. The other day I sent a message to a group chat. &quot;N&quot; receives the message just fine, and answers back. &quot;A&quot; responds to me in a private conversation (all this is happening via push), probably saying they couldn't read my message (?), but their message appears as &quot;bad encrypted message&quot;. Annoyed by this problem that has always plagued me since the very day I installed TextSecure (it keeps happening every once in a while), I end the secure session with A, unregister from the push service and register again. Now A can read my messages and I can read theirs. Yesterday I posted another message to the same group. A could read it and respond, while N couldn't. However, when N writes me in a private chat between us alone, everything works fine (we read each other's messages). This &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; has been affecting me -- and my friends -- ever since we installed the application. Is there a reason why it happens? Please find a fix, I feel embarrassed for recommending my friends this application and causing them all these troubles.

		If sending a push message failed due to a bad connnection the Toast message SmsReceiver_currently_unable_to_send_your_sms_message is shown. Ignoring if it is either SMS, MMS or Push. See MMSSender SMSSender It's kind of confusing if TS tells you that the SMS could not be sent if it was a push message...

		I've had a problem communicating with one specific textsecure user for some time now. I currently have both our phones in front of me and its clear that her phone doesn't know my identity key. As many times as I click &quot;End Secure Session&quot; on both devices, nothing changes. What should we do? Also, is there a way to force your device to completely forget the keys of a TS user and start again as. If it were your first text with them? I feel like that would fix some problems I occasionally have.

		Hello, I have not found a way to send a SMS to multiple recipients without creating a group. That could be useful for some reasons. In my case, I don't send messages to one well defined group all the time, it is very usual that I send a message to a group +/- 2 or 3 recipients. And it is often for only one or two messages. Those are the reasons why I think that having a way to send SMS to multiple recipients without creating a group could be useful. Thanks Thorleif, PS: I apologize if anyone suggests it yet but I haven't found with keyword and I have not enough time to scroll every issues.

		When storing received images, these are saved in the usual &quot;Pictures&quot; folder but now have the file extension &quot;.attach&quot;. Pictures can be still be viewed on a computer after manually changing the extension but they do not appear in the Android gallery because they are not detected as image files. The change must be introduced in a recent update, the feature worked well for a long time (my last successfully saved picture is from 11 October 2014). As I only receive pictures I could not yet test whether audio and video files are affected as well.

		Since the last TS update I can't properly save any received pictures to my internal memory. Checking the according storage location with a file manager I can see that the respective file is written, however the proper file extension (.jpg) is missing, making the file inaccessible by any photo gallery app. Manually adding the file extension works. The issue can be reproduced on other devices running stock Android (Motorola G 2013, LG G3) Device info: Samsung Galaxy SII (GT-I9100), Cyanogenmod 11 M11 (Android 4.4.4), TextSecure 2.1.10

		I'm trying to use TextSecure as a messenger, but so far I can't receive any messages from others via TextSecure. I'm using the OnePlus One with CM11 and build R33 (although there is an update to R38). I activated the WhisperPush account with the phone number and got the activation code, but I was never asked to set up a passphrase or anything else. When I wanted to chat with my contact, which has TextSecure as well, but on Android 4.4. The messages he sends aren't delivered and the messages I send seem to be send as normal texts/sms. Could it be that I haven't got a Google Account and therefore aren't logged in? Any ideas where the problem could be? Thanks Fukurai

		This is something that I miss very much in this app. I know this isn't needed for a push message, but for an SMS it is. Current implementation of displaying number only if 15 chars are left (first image) is not very convenient, because I don't know if I'm on a first set of 120 chars or did I write more than 120 chars. Images 2 and 3 are just a sketch: what if there would be option to display this indicator permanently. https://mediacru.sh/d71d311f7466 Or something combined: number of characters left will be displayed when 15 chars are left to second message, and if you cross to second/third/... message a permanent message number indicator would be displayed. (Just a thought.)

		I have a contact who is using TextSecure but not the PUSH functionality. Since I have upgraded to 2.2.0.0 I had to close the secure session since I was not able to read the received encrypted SMS and wanted to reinitiate a secure session, but it looks like the button does not exist anymore? I guess I am just too stupid to find the function, because with a contact that uses Push I can choose to send either encrypted Push, encrypted SMS or unencrypted SMS.

		I've seen this mentioned a few times about 8 months back, and I'm just wondering: what's the current solution to this problem? Let's say the user is unwilling to re-install TS to de-register their account from the network. What's the plan at that point? I've had this happen with a few friends, even just when they've had to temporarily use loner phones, and it's fairly frustrating. I spend a bit of time each day reading on privacy and security. They're very important to me, and for someone like me/us, having to mess around with this stuff is no big deal. But for the average person? Believe me, bits of friction like this are more than enough to turn them off completely, making widespread adoption all but impossible. If you need any additional information, don't hesitate to ask.

		After about a week of successful encrypted communications with a particular contact, I started receiving garbled messages. We both ended the secure session, deleted the conversation, and restarted it, at which point I got a &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; error. After ending this second (and apparently unsuccessful) secure session, we are communicating unencrypted and I am using plain sms (not push) messages. When I send a message to said contact, I am (after a delay) receiving my own message echoed back as if the contact had sent it to me -- complete with a notification alert. This has happened twice now. The first time my own message was echoed back 6 minutes after I sent it. The second time, 25 minutes afterward. Here's my debug log: http://hastebin.com/nuhewuwunu

		When my friends send me a vertical taken picture Textsecure seems to rotate and save it horizonal. Its very anoying. Could there be an option tu rotate pictures inside textsecure and watch them in fullscreen in the encryptet format? So with out the needing to save them outside textsecure. In the the little what i know of programming I¨d imagine its an easy fix to make rotating option?

		I have registered and unregistered a user with my local TS server. TS now shows this user as a registered PUSH user although this user is definetly no in the PSQL database on my server. Deleting this user from my contacts and adding him again, TS shows this user as unregistered for the first time but then as registered in the second run. When trying to send a message to him the first PUSH mesage gets lots but then TS is trying to send a encr. SMS to him. Any thoughts why this happens? http://hastebin.com/ofupufoxib

		Over the weekend I added a member to a Textsecure group I've been using successfully for months. The delivery receipts had been working great until I added this new member. Now when I send a message to the group, I see the background go from dark blue to medium blue, then the delivery receipt checkbox shows up and then disappears! Certainly not a show-stopper but I was loving this functionality. Notes: I had the two contacts under the same contact using sub-numbers initially when this started happening. Since then I split them out into two separate contacts but the problem is not resolved. SGS4, Verizon, stock 4.4.2

		I'm running Android 4.4 on a Nexus 4. During installation, I received a verification SMS, which resulted in a notification in my notification center. After having set TextSecure as my default SMS app, I was no longer able to dismiss the notification. I was able to work around this by temporarily setting the built-in app as the default, dismissing the message, and then setting TextSecure as the default again. Not a huge deal, but a minor usability annoyance. Really awesome app, thanks for making it!

		We are sending texts through a email to SMS gateway provided by t-mobile (@tmomail.net) and on one phone android version 4.3 with textsecure version 2.2.0 and each time a text is recieved the messages are not clustered under the same user. Instead they are shown as coming from a unique 3 difit number that seems to start with a 9 each time. We have attempted to add the from email address ass a contact. We do know that this does not happen with all android textsecure installations. Any help moving us closer to getting all of the messages clustered under the same contact would be helpful.

		Hello ! I installed textsecured on two phones. On the second one, the icon to send the message is blue, and the lock is closed, so I assume this means I can send secured sms to the first phone. But on the first phone, the icon is still green, and the lock still open. So I can just send classic SMS to the second phone. When I disable the ability to send classic SMS on this phone, I am unable to send SMS to the second one. Is there a way to force the use of secured sms, or is it a bug ? Thank you for your answer, and please excuse my flawed english.

According to the docs, the function SecretKey uses both parameters to generate a secret key (it is used in line 52) and it seems that the unitialised value of salt is used there.

		TextSecure seems to throw up when it receives a certain delivery receipt: http://hastebin.com/ebeyonakuw This is within a group chat, but I actually don't think this should make a difference. I'll try to provoke this in a one-on-one chat later. If that could be related: One of the buddies I'm chatting with (and whom I suspect to generate that error with his receipts) recently changed his key.

		I have an issue that is similar to #2067 - I did not add someone to the group chat, but for one member, delivery notifications seem to error out (see #2086). As soon as this receipt is received, the message goes into &quot;error state&quot;, i.e. displaying the error-triangle. This feels kinda wrong, because it looks like the message was not sent at all. Then, as soon as another receipt is received (from someone else in the group), the message goes back to &quot;everything OK&quot; - now it's not visible anymore that there was any problem.

		Currently the confirmation / return receipt UI shows two states: Receipt confirmed Absence of receipt confirmation This could be more useful. It isn't so great when the remote user is e.g. in a building with poor data coverage, has their phone off, etc. Currently I often have messages get through which are never confirmed, but definitely received ... eventually. One implementation wrinkle I can think of might be a choice between &quot;confirm all received messages, eventually&quot; versus &quot;give up on confirmation after a timeout.&quot; Either way, I believe presenting information on the state of message confirmation, rather than the presence or absence, is valuable to the TextSecure user sending messages. These proposals are mutually exclusive. Proposal 1: Confirmed, Awaiting Confirmation, Gave Up For messages which have been confirmed, TextSecure MUST (and does) show a &quot;confirmed&quot; UI element. For messages which have been sent but not confirmed, TextSecure SHOULD show an &quot;awaiting confirmation&quot; UI element. My suggestion: perhaps a clock superimposed on an envelope. For messages on which confirmation has been given up (perhaps after an hour), TextSecure SHOULD show a &quot;gave up confirmation&quot; UI element. My suggestion: A question mark superimposed on an envelope. Proposal 2: Confirmed, Awaiting Confirmation, Confirmation Is Taking a Really Long Time but If The Message Is Received It Will Eventually Be Confirmed For messages which have been confirmed, TextSecure MUST (and does) show a &quot;confirmed&quot; UI element. For messages which have been sent but not confirmed, TextSecure SHOULD show an &quot;awaiting confirmation&quot; UI element. My suggestion: perhaps a clock superimposed on an envelope. For messages on which confirmation is taking a really long time (say, more than 1 hour), TextSecure SHOULD show a &quot;waiting a long time for confirmation&quot; UI element. My suggestion: either a clock + question mark / interrobang (‽), or just a question mark or interrobang superimposed on an envelope. If the recipient phone is turned on 3 weeks later and old messages still exist on the sender phone, they will be confirmed. For unconfirmed messages which are deleted, TextSecure SHOULD discard incoming confirmation acknowledgements. Proposal 2 should be subjected to threat analysis. (What if the recipient doesn't want their receipt of the messages confirmed after a while?) Proposal 1 seems easier to implement while still actively giving the user more understanding of the status of their message - either we're still awaiting confirmation for a reasonable time or we gave up after a reasonable time but the contact may or may not have received the message.

		I know, the SMS feature is going to die, but nevertheless I found an issue. I got the number of a friend which uses secure SMS only and did neither have push enabled, nor mobile data on his phone. I wanted to send him a secure SMS but I was not able to, I was not even able to scan his qr-code. he had to enable his mobile data and enable push and then we have been able to exchange keys. Isn't the qr code feature exactly for a usw case like that?

		SMS supports sending longer messages in multiple chunks (I am actually not sure how this works on the protocol level). TextSecure should be able to assemble them. Right now the show up as separate messages sometimes even in the wrong order. At least I have been observing this for texts send from iOS to my Android device.

		Since the delivery confirmation functionality has been implemented, I sent 48 messages. For 3 of these, I did not get a confirmation that they have been delivered. It would be nice if messages are automatically resent if no delivery confirmation is received. Especially, if later messages to the same recipient do get a delivery confirmation, indicating that the recipient is reachable again.

		From an article on Android Police: &quot;Google's final announcement [about Google Play Services 6.5] may actually have the greatest impact of all. With the latest release, the GMS library will be broken up into individual parts for each major set of APIs. This will finally alleviate the stress of including the full library, which weighs in at almost exactly 1 MB after it's compiled into an app. For example, an app that only requires push messaging will be able to do so while only increasing its footprint by about 75KB. While most users with current, high-end devices probably don't notice the burden, this is great for older and budget-oriented hardware. This change will also go a long way towards reducing memory usage and download size. Oh yeah, and this should cut a minute or two off of compile times. Hallelujah!&quot;

		Hi, I have a group chat with two friends of mine. In the last days I noticed that I do not receive messages in this group chat while my device has no internet connection (for example because it's rebooting or I'm in a building where I have no signal). I would expect that these messages are delivered to me as soon as my device has an internet connection again. Android version: Cyanogen Mod 11 (Android 4.4) TextSecure version: 2.2.0 Kind regards, Josef

		Can you add the ability to schedule text messages in TextSecure for Android? I really miss that feature from my stock Galaxy Note 2 texting app in that sometimes I need to schedule text messages to people at certain times of the day. Or if they are not awake yet I schedule it for a time when they will be awake. Thank You

This seem to happen only when you come back from an unthemed activity like Configure MMS settings (pops up, when you want to attach something on an non TS registered device without MMS settings) Change passphrase (enable local encryption in settings) but not if you press &quot;Skip&quot; in the TS registration activity opened from the green reminder?! To verify my assumption I added DynamicTheme to PassphraseChangeActivity which seemed to helped. (I am aware that this activity is not fully themed yet. In fact I'm working on applying dynamic themeing were it's missing...) EDIT coming back from submit debug also recolors the icons and yes, latest HEAD :)

		I believe that group messages are currently only marked with the receive receipt indicator if every participant's phone has sent one. The usability could be much improved if the detailed message information which is shown after a long-click on the message followed by clicking the &quot;i&quot; icon contained the receive receipt status of all participants. eg: Receive statuses: Alice: [✓] Bob: [✓] Marry: [ ] What do you think? 👍 5 ❤️ 1

		Nexus 5, Android 5.0 (LRX21O), TextSecure 2.3.0, default keyboard settings Performance is fine when the device first boots but degrades quickly and input becomes noticeably delayed. RAM usage climbs as well, currently it's at 272MB with 16.5 hours of uptime. This only affects the keyboard in landscape mode. I only have a few dozen threads with no more than a handful of messages in each. This problem is also experienced by a friend who has a Nexus 5.

		I compiled according to the Wiki. According to the wiki, the compile dependencies are: &quot;Android SDK manager&quot;
&quot;Android Support Repository&quot; - this need to be installed via the Android SDK manager
&quot;Java Development Kit (JDK)&quot; compiler for example openjdk-devel - JRE alone is not enough. At least version 7 of Java is required.
 Despite having the dependencies, compiling didn't work, it complained about a missing com.google.android.gms:play-services. I had to install the following additional packages: &quot;Google Play Services, Google Repository, Google Play services for Froyo&quot;. I don't know if all of these were needed, but I am sure Google Repository was needed. This made the compiler go a lot further. (It still fails but it's probably be an unrelated issue) After doing this, the compilation went a bit further, but now there's a new error:

		Hi there. I am using Android 4.0.4 on the Sony Xperia Mini. Textsecure worked just fine but since recently (last update?) it closes immediately after starting it. Funny: In the background of the force close message I can see the Textsecure surface coming up - so in fact it starts but I cannot use it. logcat shows this: W/GooglePlayServicesUtil( 4256): Google Play services out of date. Requires 6171000 but found 6111032 W/JobConsumer( 4256): java.lang.RuntimeException: Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare() ...but I haven't find a way to update the play services.

		I would like to update the &quot;Prerequisites&quot; section of the Wiki, because the list is incomplete and compiling fails unless several additional packages which are not mentioned in the wiki are installed via the Android Package Manager. However, I believe I installed unnecessary packages in addition to the needed ones. Before applying the changes to the Wiki, I would like to reduce the packages to the minimum needed set. Please help me by trimming unneeded fat from the following list: Prerequisites &quot;Android SDK manager&quot; &quot;Java Development Kit (JDK)&quot; compiler for example openjdk-devel - JRE alone is not enough. At least version 7 of Java is required. The following packages should be installed via the package manager: Android Support Repository, Android Support Library, Android SDK build-tools 19, Google Play Services, Android 4.4.2 (API 19) SDK Platform, Android 5.0 (API 21) SDK Platform, Android 4.4W.2 (API 20) SDK Platform, Google Repository.

		Since the update to version 2.30 of TextSecure I'm no longer able to start it. I'm using a Xperia Arc S with Android Version 4.04 (API-Level 15). Here the StackTrace: java.lang.RuntimeException: Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare() at android.os.Handler.(Handler.java: 121) at android.widget.Toast$TN. (Toast:317) at android.widget.Toast.(Toast.java:91) at android.widget.Toast.makeText(Toast.java:233) at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.GcmRefreshJob.onRun(GcmRefreshJob.java:41) at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.runJob(JobConsumer.java:72) at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.run(JobConsumer.java:46) I typed in the StackTrace by hand, therefore there may be typos. But I think the problem gets clear. I tried to trace back the exception in the source code, and it seemed that the JobConsumer should call Looper.prepare, but didn't do so. On the otherhandside I also wasn't able to find a call to makeText in the GcmRefreshJob and I doesn't look like everybody got this problem. I hope this can be fixed soon. Edit: As I just found out GcmRefreshJob changed in commit bf19307 from 13 hours ago. Maybe this already fixes the problem.

		There is a small text in the ConversationActivity after creating a group. At the moment (after changes regarding AppCompat It think) it's not easily readable with white text on the light-grey background. I think it should be changed back to dark grey like before.

		Seriously, just like my previous ticket: WhisperSystems#1866 Suddenly, without any notice, TS 2.3.0 requires a newer &quot;Google Play Services&quot; to be installed. Unlike other apps, who warn you of this problem, TS just crashes on start if you have the wrong version. Why is it so hard to: Write it in the changelog Check for the version on app-startup and display some sort of dialog (like google maps, e.g.) Provide support for older versions

		When upgrading from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0 TextSecure crashed and I had to downfgade. Installing 2.2.0 over 2.3.0 refused (is this a bug somewhere or done deliberately?) so I had to deinstall 2.3.0, install 2.2.0 and restore my Titanium backup. 2.3.2 did work, but complained that push mesages didn't work anymore because my Google Play Services were too old. I upgraded these to the last version, but it would have been nice if the message gave more information, like the mimimum version required.

		audio alerts on my textsecure for encrypted messages have stopped working when textsecure is locked (either manually or password timed out). It has worked fine before. Now it will show a notification when locked, but only gives audio alerts as soon as I've entered the password. Makes me miss many messages. Settings/display notifications in status bar is on. Sound is set to a valid sound. Tested with two phones (ons is a moto g with KitKat 4.4.4).

		It would be great if I was able to see the contents of the &quot;TextSecure is unlocked&quot; notification while on the lock screen but treat actual message notifications as private. Furthermore, it would be good if TextSecure could provide an option to treat the sender vs content as private separately. For example, I would like to see the sender but not the message while on the lock screen. I have no idea whether this is possible via the new Lollipop APIs but it seems like the message content could be easily omitted from the notification by TextSecure.

		For about the last two days, I've been getting the notification &quot;Permanent TextSecure communication failure!&quot; with the text &quot;TextSecure was unable to register with Google Play Services. Com&quot;. After &quot;Com&quot; I'm was sure there were more letters but they are cut off. I don't know how newer Android versions work, but on 2.3.7 the notifications don't scroll so only by reading through code can I find the text that says &quot;Communication over the data channel has been disabled, please try re-registering from the TextSecure settings menu.&quot; Of course, the next problem I have is that I cannot find any &quot;re-register&quot; option in the settings menu. Again, reading code shows me that the RegistrationActivity intent is launched by enabling &quot;Push messages&quot;, which is already enabled. So, I do that. And now, finally, I get a warning message. Google Play Services needs to be updated to use this. So there's the issue. I'm actually guessing that I didn't need to re-register, I probably just needed to update Google Play Services. Can't say for sure though, as I've already de-registered. Anyway, the original notification is thrown up by a failed call to GooglePlayServicesUtil.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(context). Instead of just checking for &quot;resullt != ConnectionResult.SUCCESS&quot;, TS could also check for the other possible return values and tell the user the actual reason behind the error.

		If I understand correctly, the only current option allows for any other app which can access the SD card to read all exported messages in plain text. Maybe there was a good reason for the removal of this feature but I couldn't find it so sorry if my issue is redundant.

		Hello! My problem is, if i send a message via Push it works great but if I have no Internet connection the message didn't get sent. In earlier version it worked. I don't use Xprivacy and TS has all rights. Now I solve it, that a hold the send button and switch to send via secure SMS, but I would prefer, when this happens automatically when I have no Internet connection. TS version 2.3.2 Best regards rene

		I recently upgraded to version 2.3.2 from 2.1.10. After doing so, I can no longer send SMS messages over T-mobile's WiFi Calling, although I can receive them just fine. I can send PUSH messages over WiFi Calling, and if I disable WiFi calling I can send SMS over the cellular network. If I used the built-in Messaging app, I can send SMS over WiFi Calling with no problem. This seems similar to #2137 so I disabled XPrivacy, but that doesn't fix anything. I'm creating a new issue because I'm not having problems with PUSH messages or with receiving SMS. Device: HTC One M7, T-mobile stock Android 4.4.3, TextSecure 2.3.2 App state: Push registered, incoming SMS enabled, outgoing SMS fully enabled Debug logs: http://hastebin.com/unofirefar

			<description>
		I have experienced this issue several times in the last few days and was able to reproduce it. I have only experienced and verified this issue with messages containing pictures, text-only messages seem to work as expected (apart from not beeing resent automatically via push when internet connectivity comes back, but that's a different issue). System: Android 4.1 rooted Samsung stock ROM TS 2.3.2 TS settings: Push messages: enabled Receive all SMS: enabled Receive all MMS: enabled Allow outgoing SMS to: TextSecure users: enabled Ask before sending SMS: enabled Non-TextSecure users: enabled Witnessed behaviour: When trying to send a picture on a spotty connection, TextSecure fails to send it via push and asks to tap the message to fall back to MMS. I tap the message and click no when asked if it should fall back. The message then shows the red triangle with the matching text that the message could not be sent. I now select the message and go to details -&gt; resend message. TextSecure does not show the &quot;please tap message to fall back&quot; dialog again, instead the message stays in the failed state with the red triangle. When the internet connection comes back, the message is sent via MMS Expected behaviour: If the internet connection is still not available TextSecure should ask for permission to fall back to MMS once again, as it does with text messages. To reproduce: disable wifi+mobile data follow the above procedure from step 2 to 5 enable wifi+mobile data again you might have to wait several minutes or select the message and choose resent instead Log: https://hastebin.com/ipogomogov.vhdl I have another log ready if needed, but I'd have to scrub this one first. I consider this a serious bug because it can lead to rather significant unexpected costs as MMS are rather expensive (at least in Europe) and even more expensive if you are roaming.

		When I send a message in this groupchat it SOMETIMES displays &quot;Error sending message&quot;. If I then check the details of the message it shows that it tried sending by MMS. However the other people in the groupchat do receive the message and do so as a push message. In the TextSecure settings I have SMS completely disabled (and so by extension also MMS). My TextSecure version is 2.3.2. I have an Cyanogenmod rom installed. This is the link to the part of my logcat where I tried sending a message in the groupchat that I got by adb (I deleted the phone numbers): https://gist.github.com/lamade10/29b322679d2f1260ab71

		CONDITIONS: TextSecure installed on duplicate devices Galaxy S4. One is stock OEM (AOSP 4.4.2), the other Cyanogenmod (CM11-SnapshotM12 AOSP 4.4.4). CM unit has WhisperPush and TextSecure App. WhisperPush not in use. TextSecure has been successfully registered on both devices. Both units using cellular; wifi disabled. When CM user sends text to OEM user, message is transmitted and received successfully. When OEM user replies (or initiates message), transmission is successful, but CM user doesn't receive unless reboot with WiFi enabled.

		Today I sent a photo to a friend of mine. For some reason (=no reason), TextSecure said it couldn't send it. Fine. So I clicked on &quot;resend&quot; aaaaand.... it sent the photo as an MMS instead of a push message. What's funny is that in the settings I allowed outgoing SMSs ONLY to non-textsecure users, so that's another reason why this shouldn't have happened. In Europe, we do pay for an MMS and they're usually pretty expensive. After all the &quot;MMS fixes&quot; I wonder how come no one ever fixed this.. ?

		After setting up a couple of people with TextSecure, we were all stumped that TextSecure did not have a way to add a new phone number to a Contact. We tried everything we can think of and no luck. So I decided to file a bug report, and found #822 then explored a bit more, and found that you can add an unknown number as a contact by clicking the blank avatar icon. This was not intuitive but I think it can be greatly improved by a simple fix: add a + to the blank avatar icon if clicking it will trigger the &quot;add to contacts&quot; sequence.

		When I receive an MMS, I get a notification which contains a preview of the message. With MMS, when I tap the notification, it does nothing. I can tap it many times and it does not open the message/thread in TextSecure. SMS works properly, though. When I click an SMS notification, it opens the TextSecure app. If further explanation is needed, I could probably provide a video.

		Recently as I got a new phone, I experienced some issues with group messaging. As I cannot say, how far they are related, I'll just describe, what happened. First of all did a backup of the messages on the old phone. Tried to unregister push on the old phone. This didn't work with some rather generic error message (something like &quot;unable to perform task&quot; or so, don't remember exactly). Installed Textsecure on the new phone, registered for push. Imported backup from the old phone. So far, so good. The hassle began, when the first group message arrived. The message is shown in a conversation named &quot;Unknown group&quot;. There's no way for me to change the group name or even leave the group to be readded. After someone else has added me to the group a second time (although I was already part of the group according to his phone), I can see the group name and receive messages – but only from the one who readded me. Messages from other members are not shown. However, now I can leave the group. After being readded again, I can now receive all messages from any group member again.

		Hi Guys, first of all, you've done an awesome job! I've just one issue over here: Neither in the main app-view, nor in the conversation-views, the &quot;...&quot; menu button shows up. I tried restarting the app and the phone ;) Btw: I didn't know that this button should be in the corner on the top right, until a colleague showed me that I could have been able to attach pictures from within the app, if the button would have been there ;) Phone details: HTC One S Android-Version 4.1.2 Please let me know, if you need additional info (Screenshot, ...)

			<description>
		Not sure if this is a regression of the latest release, but I just noticed this behaviour on my Samsung SIII (GT-I9300) and wife's GT-I9305, both with stock Android 4.3 - both with latest TextSecure. When looking at a contact's thread, long pressing on messages that include: a photo or a number that has been auto-recognized by Android (therefore underlined) ... does not work as expected: Such messages cannot be selected (they will not be highlighted), even though the &quot;info&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; buttons will show up. Performing any action on them (like copy or forward) makes it obvious (when pasting or sending the forwarded message) that a different message has actually been copied to the clipboard! Example: I long-press on msg number 10 in a thread, click the &quot;copy&quot; icon, then paste in the text input area and a different message (usually 11 or 14 ) is pasted! The same effect is seen with copy/paste, forward and message deletion. To test whether you're affected by this bug: Find a TextSecure message that meets the above criteria (has underlined numbers or a photo) Long-press to select it Tap the &quot;copy&quot; icon Long-press in the message composition area Tap &quot;paste&quot; If a different message (or nothing) is pasted, you're bitten by the bug.

		It would be really nice to have the option to ignore group notifications for specific groups. Not having this feature is really stopping me from using groups in TS because I don't want to get 100 notifications a minute I don't care about at that moment, but I also don't want to kill the notifications completely because somebody might want to contact me personally.

			<description>
		When reinstalling TextSecure or switching the SIM card to another phone, PUSH service registration often fails because the number is already registered. This forces the user to go to https://whispersystems.org/textsecure/unregister/ and unregister manually. Average users don't know that they have to unregister first. They even don't know the above mentioned page. And that GCM eventually notifies the server about unregistration seems unreliable due to the fact that many users really have trouble with this issue and are unable to proceed using TextSecure. (just wondering if similar steps are necessary when web sockets come in...) I propose to let the registration process check if the number is already registered and automatically perform the necessary steps to unregister and re-register the number. When I understand the unregister web page correctly, this is authenticated by receiving an SMS (or call). I think this is possible when using the same SIM card / phone number. This would greatly enhance the usability.

		Because of a 401 error, TextSecure can't download MMS. Because of this, when I get sent an MMS, I get notified daily. Each day, my phone's LED flashes and I have a notification in the notification bar. In the conversation, it shows another &quot;download&quot; button. Is there a way to stop these daily notifications?

		I have searched through all issues and was wondering i couldn't find this issue neither open nor closed. The idea is to have a status message with text and/or emojis for yourself and group chats. The problem for this ER is to display the message, because at the moment there's no space for it. If we look at e.g.: Whatsapp, you can see the status in the chat overview and in a contacts view Currently you can see the last message in the chat overview. I would rather like to see the status message of a user there instead. So I think it would be a smaller problem to achieve this. To have a status message in the contacts view is a tougher job, because there is no contacts view yet. What we have now is the stock android contacts view you get, after clicking on the contacts avatar in the overview. So this would be an entirely new view. Maybe this should be a new issue also... An own contacts view would be a nice improvement, because we could add other little informations there. I think this little nice improvement would make it more fun to use TS.

		My contacts and I are experiencing serious issues lately. We are all receiving messages from some days ago -- a friend of mine just got a message I sent him on Nov 30. What's funny is that the messages are marked as delivered on the sender's phone. Of course we all connect to the internet every day and this behaviour is bugging us greatly.

		Hello, What I noticed: After upgrade to 2.3.2 I can't send SMS. It is related to dual sim - when one of the sim cards has no signal - textsecure doesn't try to send an sms. It waits indefinitely also using a cpu (constant wakelock).

		Since Nov 25 (so shorty after the 2.3 release) some push notifications are not delivered. The messages were send without error on both cellular and wifi but they never made it to the reciver. 2/3 of the messages send did however get to the reciever without delay or other issues. This might be related to issue #2198... I'm currently using TS 2.3.3 on a Moto G with Android 4.4.4 and the issue has been arround since 2.3 Thanks a lot for TS! I hope this can be fixed soon...

		I just had TS ask for the password (nothing new so far). However, when I pulled down the Android menu I had the persistent notification saying that TS was unlocked. The problem is that it shouldn't ask for the password if the notification says that it's unlocked :| What's up? I'd open #2174, which was closed for no good reason and never re-opened.

		Over the past week or so, I have been getting phantom push message notifications. By phantom, I mean an &quot;encrypted message&quot; notification appears, but then the are no new messages after I unlock text secure. Initially there was only one phantom message, a day it two later there were two, now there are six. They seem to appear shortly after time text secure locks itself. Edit: Have confirmed that the phantom notification appears immediately after (manually) locking textsecure. Device : motorola XT1045 (peregrine_retus)

		A friend has TextSecure but deactivates the data connection oftentimes during the day. Since I can’t tell when it’s active or not on their side (and I’m too lazy / I forget), I always send via data. This results in the messages not being delivered until said friend activates the data connection again (even though they have normal cell connection, so a text would go through). I’m pretty sure this is a known problem but I couldn’t find an existing issue for it. Also not sure if it’s possible to solve or an underlying architectural problem. I was thinking something like: If the push message isn’t delivered in 10 minutes, automatically re-send it via text and delete the push message from the queue. If that’s possible.

		Since installing TextSecure on my Verizon Galaxy S5, I cannot send SMS texts to two specific recipients: my parents. I can send them to my sister and to everyone else in my contacts I've tried. When I want to text to my parents, I have to send a group SMS or attach a photo to my SMS to make it an MMS to them. I receive all texts from them fine. They both have iPhones.

		While it's nice to have receipts that a message has been received (i.e. by the receiving TextSecure app), in some cases it would be even better to have to know if a message has been viewed. By default, this might be too much information to provide, but it would be nice if a user could specify that s/he wants to make this information available to a set of other users.

		https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d610a9f7079a345301ea Android 4.4.4, Samsung Galaxy S3, ATT, wifi connected, nova launcher. On a thread of 8 mixed devices (iOS, textsecure, various android) If I click the message from the notification dropdown, the message does not load and I need to re-enter my password to get in. Clicking the check mark to &quot;mark as read&quot; seems to work fine. This started happening recently, but it's been probably at least a week since my most recent other group message. I have not tried doing anything with picture messages. Group messages with 3 other TS users are fine.

		I live in an out of service area and so I use Tmobile's wifi calling feature a lot. TextSecure has worked wonderfully for a long time (a couple years) but just very recently, I cannot send text messages while connected via the wifi calling. I can receive text messages using wifi calling, but then I have to switch to the regular texting app that came with my phone to send anything. If I'm connected to cell service directly, I can both send and receive without issue. My phone is an HTC Amaze, not rooted, running android 4.0.3. The debug log from textSecure's settings menu shows just this: Device: HTC HTC_Amaze_4G (htc_ruby) Android: IML74K OS Host: abm022 App :TextSecure 2.3.3 (the &quot;app&quot; line is formatted on my phone with two spaces before the colon and none after)

		TextSecure kept crashing when I would open text message threads. So I'm trying backup all my data to my laptop and delete all threads from my phone to start fresh. But I'm not sure how to view the images or messages in the &quot;plaintext backup&quot; on my phone. How do you do this? It is a mixture of mms, sms, and push messages.

		As there are often issues with new features or fixes, there should be a guideline (or better an automated GUI test) to ensure functionality. For these tests it would be great to have a sample database to use or at least and in addition dummy recipients and groups provided by the TS server that can be stressed.

		Hello, I am unable to attach photos and other files from my external SD card to messages. When I select “Add attachment” in a message thread, the file browser only shows the entries “Recent”, “Downloads”, and “Internal Storage”, lacking the SD card (as well as, say, the Gallery app, but that’s of no importance to me) regardless of whether I want to send a picture, video, or sound (see picture). The SD card is a 64 GB, Samsung-made card of the “EVO” series. Sending files from my old, 8 GB SD card worked and works just fine. However, all the other apps I’ve tried accessing the new card with (Gallery, Total Commander, PPSSPP, …) see, read from, and write to it without a problem. It might be an issue with the file picker, but I couldn’t find another app that uses the same one as TextSecure. My device is a European Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I’m running Android 4.4.2 which I have rooted, but I’ve found nothing pertaining to this in XPrivacy’s settings.

		AFAICS, textsecure uses some Kex based on DH which is effectively anonymous. When I add a new contact, it immediately sells me the conversation as being secure, even when no fingerprint exchange or something like that has happened. This basically makes the whole app and idea of encryption useless as anyone could MitM and I wouldn't notice, which is made even worse by the fact that I cannot even mark such contacts which I've manually verified to be verified (as it's e.g. known from OTR). Actually I'd prefer an option that I can reject any contacts which I haven't verified.

		A contact of mine sent me a vcard that contained an image via MMS. Textsecure downloaded it and displayed the whole ASCII encoded image as text which slowed down the app to the point where it crashed. Textsecure was not usable until i managed to delete the MMS (on the 5th try it did not crash). This could be used as some kind of DOS attack i think. Please include some kind of safeguard.

		Version 2.3.3 Motorola Moto X2, android 4.4.4 on Republic Wireless. If you're not familiar, RW uses a baked-in VOIP app to allow normally cell-based functions like calls and SMS to go over wifi. While on wifi only, Textsecure will receive SMS normally. It will not send SMS, secure or plain. It does however send secure Push Messages to other Textsecure users with no issue. Stock Messenger app will send both SMS and MMS over wifi no problem.

		According to @liliakai (we spoke in the Freenode channel), TextSecure uses SMS delivery reports rather than issuing them itself. This allows a malicious service provider (or, depending on exactly how secure SMS is, anyone that happens to be nearby the recipient) to withhold|drop a message that was sent via SMS while issuing a successful delivery report, potentially resulting in heated debates over messages that never actually arrived. To prevent this, TextSecure should issue its own (signed) delivery reports.

		We are using a group chat with 9 members (A, B, C ... H, I). I'm running TextSecure 2.3.3. The following happens when I try to send a message inside our group: I do see the small tick underneath the message (no blue or green background) I receive a warning that there was an error while sending the message (green background, red triangle), the tick disappears I receive a message telling me that there are changed, but unknown identity information. I can tap on the message, the message is replaced with a key. Nevertheless, everyone in the group receives my message. The same problem exists for at least two more users (B and C), but interesteringly not for everyone. Another problem is that I don't receive any messages from user D, but everyone else does (including B and C). There are also some users who don't have any problems at all. There are no problems if I send a direct message to any of our group members. The messages are encrypted and sent (blue background), everything seems to be fine. You can find a complete log over here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9d4097ed0db6e0339d53

		Occurs with latest HEAD. I suspect #2237 causes this, as it worked before. Could be coincidence. Self sending media message leads to receiving message bubble misses image the avater is default mr. open mouth (though contact has an own avatar) receive bubble only appears on reentering conversation or sending another message sometimes the bubble is green instead of blue after sending (blue after reentering) Text only works though - avatar is correct. Also receiving non self messages seems to work. 12-23 10:21:26.172  13028-13054/org.thoughtcrime.securesms W/MmsSmsDatabase﹕ Executing query: SELECT _id, body, type, thread_id, address, address_device_id, subject, date_sent, date_received, m_type, msg_box, status, part_count, ct_l, tr_id, m_size, exp, st, delivery_receipt_count, transport_type FROM (SELECT DISTINCT date_sent * 1 AS date_sent, date * 1 AS date_received, _id, body, read, thread_id, type, address, address_device_id, subject, NULL AS m_type, NULL AS msg_box, status, NULL AS part_count, NULL AS ct_l, NULL AS tr_id, NULL AS m_size, NULL AS exp, NULL AS st, delivery_receipt_count, 'sms' AS transport_type FROM sms WHERE (thread_id = 11) UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT date * 1000 AS date_sent, date_received * 1000 AS date_received, _id, body, read, thread_id, NULL AS type, address, address_device_id, NULL AS subject, m_type, msg_box, NULL AS status, part_count, ct_l, tr_id, m_size, exp, st, delivery_receipt_count, 'mms' AS transport_type FROM mms WHERE (thread_id = 11) ORDER BY date_received ASC)

		Using Android 4.4.4, Textsecure 2.3.3, on Motorola XT1032. Textsecure was installed from Google Play Store. When I configure Textsecure as standard SMS app and deactivate the internet connections, Textsecure should send messages as SMS also to Textsecure contacts. This does not work for one phone number of my address book (it says error sending message, both for encrypted and unencrypted SMS). The phone number contained a plus sign (+49). When I replaced it by 0049, it worked, so I think the cause for the error message is the + sign. The phone number is also valid with the plus sign, so Textsecure should be able to cope with it.

		I've just reinstalled TextSecure and as I try to register it says that it can't connect to the push server. What's the problem? Does TextSecure relies on Google Services? If yes, why does it need it? I've disabled some built in apps, but Google Services are enabled.

		Hello all, Recently, I've switched to Viperone m8 3.2.1 rom on my HTC one m8 (Verizon). Everything seems to work fine including calls, 4g/3g, etc. However, it doesn't detect my sim card properly as it should. So this causes TextSecure to ask for my MMS settings even though it already had them entered. The strange part is that I can send MMS txts just fine. But not receive them. See the pictures below. I even tried to add my APN, but there is no option to add it. Debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aba2acd498cfc7b53ec4

		Several times now, I've sent a friend a message only to have them tell me out-of-band that they received it, but couldn't read it. All of these occasions happened when we didn't communicate for several days. I'm guessing that the undecryptable behaviour is intentional, due to Axolotl deleting unused message keys after a timeout, to prevent an attack where the adversary withholds ciphertext in the hope of recovering the recipient device later. If my diagnosis is correct, please add some sort of UI indication on the sending side that this may be taking place. Currently, the absence of &quot;delivery failed&quot; suggests to me they received it and decrypted it, when only the former is true and the latter is false.

		Hi, the scenario: B sends an image to A over encrypted channel. There is an error on transmission A cannot decrypt the message Textsecure interprets the message as plaintext (in the pane with all chats it is visible in preview as some base64-string) On opening of the chat Textsecure tries to render the multi-kilobyte &quot;text&quot; message Crash This is critical as A can not chat with B any more. The only hotfix so far seems that B sends 10-20 messages to A, so the corrupted message is not visible on opening the conversation, but only after scrolling. It is still impossible to scroll behind the corrupted message this way, so this is just a temporary hotfix. Suggested fix: all text messages with more than X characters are rendered only partially and have to be clicked on to be shown completely. This will allow for the corruped message to be rendered partially and removed by hand. (As a side effect this will allow for easier scrolling beyond long messages)

		The section on export controls in README.md is wrong. For one thing, ENC and TSU are two different Export Exceptions. The way it works for &quot;publicly available encryption source code&quot; is there is a section in the TSU exception that allows export providing that notification of the location of the source is sent to NSA and BIS using email.

		I know this is a huge feature request and my intention is to begin the discussion. I've just started using TextSecure as a secure replacement for Google Hangouts. I use Hangouts both on my Android phone and on the desktop, so that I can switch to a full size keyboard when I am at home or work. This is a great feature that I'd love to see implemented by a secure messaging system. My suspicion is that multiple clients acting as the same identity (and hence all being able to read the same chat history and send messages) is either impossible or very difficult to achieve in a client-side encryption model. Is this true? Do you have any intention to support such a feature in the short or long term?

		The icons for audio and video attachments are only available in 72x72 which makes them look pretty ulgy retro in the draft preview. Besides that the media message bubble is too large for them. Copied both draft preview icons next to each other: And somehow they both don't fit into the app design... Would b more consistent to have ic_attach_audio_holo_light/dark and ic_attach_video_holo_light/dark indicate the media type.

		Cyanogmod WhisperPush is currently holding my account hostage. It will not allow me to unregister and therefore I am not able to register with TextSecure. I also am not able to use WhisperPush as the phone I registered with was wiped and sold. WhisperPush's registration seems to be broken server-side and they don't seem to be responsive. While I agree that this is Cyanogemod's issue, I do see this as a design flaw of TextSecure as you could create a DOS for users. There seem to be a fair amount of people having this issue. See the following: daveio/whisperpush-unregister#11 https://jira.cyanogenmod.org/browse/CYAN-4512 http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/8112872-how-to-register-after-exhausting-all-options-for-unregistering-from-whisperpush I apologize if this is a proper issue, I just wanted to start some discussion around it.

		This has happened a number of times.. but long messages get cut off with no rhyme or reason, and the word &quot;null&quot; is at the end of the now-cut-off message. Seems to be sms or mms. Has happened multiple times in a single conversation, or waited 3 months to happen again. Device info: Nexus 5, rooted stock ROM 4.4.4, Textsecure 2.3.3 debug log: https://gist.github.com/aacfab6b864770cbc53b Note that this log was generated a couple hours after the latest instance.

		Currently message delivery is unreliable. It often happens that I send a message to someone, but do not get a message receipt (check-mark icon). Messages sent later get a receipt. When I talk to the person a few hours later, they tell me they did not receive the message. This issue is not limited to me sending, but also happens the other way around. It also happens for other people, as I have been told. It also happens for the message receipts themselves – sometimes a message arrives on my phone, but the sender never receives the receipt. The CyanogenMod integrated WhisperPush service is not involved. The issue happens between stock Android users, as well as with CyanogenMod users. From reading other issues I understand that GCM does not offer reliable delivery. I wonder if the equivalent of XEP-0198 section 4 &quot;Acks&quot; could be implemented on top of it in TextSecure.

		In my opinion it would be a great enhancement to see if the other person is typing at the moment. If I write long texts for example and click on send but keep writing to send another message I often get interrupted because the other person doesn't know that some more messages will follow... Would there be any chance to add something like &quot;xy's typing&quot; (WhatsApp) or some &quot;...&quot; (Hangouts)? Or do you think there's no need for it? Of course (if possible) you should be able to disable this feature if you think it invades your privacy! What do you guys think?

		I have a couple androids floating about and I travel a lot, I was looking to setup some automatic forwarding of SMS so that friends of mine (who are silly and don't use this great service) can contact my local number still and it will be forwarded out of the country to my other number via the text secure protocol. Warning setting a cap on the number of messages per unit time or something similar may be wise, don't want people to abuse/flood/DDOS and bring down the service.

		Dear developers, first of all I would like to say thank you for your hard and great work! I am using TextSecure for nearly one year now - with my family, friends and in my circle of acquaintances. During Christmas time a lot of those guys got new phones or updated to the newest available Android versions, running now mostly Android KitKat. The problem such &quot;normal&quot; end-users nowadays face, is the missing Emoji-button within the version running on KitKat. Unfortunately not everyone knows how to install alternative keyboards or is willing to do so. And not every type of keyboard offers the functionality of &quot;Emojis&quot; (e.g. on Huawei Ascend P7). There are several reasons I somehow could understand those people. It's a pity - if such users switch back to commercial messenger apps because of this &quot;problem&quot;. It would be great if you could add the Emoji-button once again in the KitKat-version, so we could spread TextSecure even wider. Thank you for your time and consideration. kaz4r

		Hi Folks, I seem unable to send an MMS using TextSecure. This is on T-Mobile in the US with an HTC One M2. All I get is an error that says, &quot;Error sending message&quot;. I'm not so expert at reading debug logs, but this looks like it might be the root of the problem: Connection to http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com:80 refused W/OutgoingMmsConnection( 6786): at ... A few other notes: I get the same error whether I send a &quot;secure MMS&quot; or an &quot;insecure MMS&quot;. I can send via secure TextSecure message: no error, and the message goes through, SMS works. (But I can't send a picture, of course.) I have tried both with the automatic settings, and by manually setting the MMSC URL setting to the one found here (http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapenc). Neither seems to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

		this is with Textsecure 2.3.3 on Cyanogenmod 10 on a Sony Xperia Mini Pro: Sending pictures via PUSH does not work reliably for me. Failing is not 100% reproducable but these steps seem to trigger the failure regularly: attach a picture from inside the app via &quot;add attachment&quot; * attach a picture via &quot;share&quot; from another app and also add a text to the same message Failure means either: the message does not get send, and I get a read triangle, the message turns green and a tab appears with &quot;tap for MMS fallback&quot; ** or the message gets send but the receiver gets a MMS which gets rendered as a HUGE chunk of text (the processing of which makes the receivers Textsecure process appear as frozen) *** What seems to work (but I could swear that I saw this fail also some time ago) is attaching a picture via &quot;share&quot; from another app and NOT add any text in the same message... *) I captured a logcat for this scenario **) I was not even aware of a MMS fallback feature, as I have no configuration option for this (in contrast to the SMS fallback). Is there one? ***) I guess I have to pay for all these MMSs? :-( [edited] cleared up formatting for the footnotes

I know there's the option &quot;Add contact info&quot; but it just sends the phone number of a selected contact without the name or any other information about it (like email adress, birthday, etc). If I open the contacts app (on Android 5.0) and choose a contact to share, TextSecure is not available in the list of applications that I could use to share the contact info... I really like the way WhatsApp handles contact sharing, but I have no idea if there is a chance to get a similar way of sharing contacts in Textsecure... I have to admit I'm not a developer and these are just some ideas I have, but I don't know if it is possible for you to implement it. In my opinion this would be a nice improvement for TS :) EDIT: I guess the problem with the missing sharing option in the Android contacts app has already been issue #1407 . Sorry for the duplicate!

		When a PUSH message fails to send (say because there's no internet connection), it's given a green background and a red triangle icon to the left hand side. The green background is exactly the same as when a message is sent (maybe unencrypted?) over SMS because PUSH was no longer available for that user (or maybe some other reason). When a message failed to send, and was actually not sent, and needs to either be resent or deleted, feels like there could be a better colour than green. Maybe a grey background to suggest that it's not sent, sort of greyed out, or maybe something red to suggest failure. I'll leave the specifics up to folks smarter than I. :-)

		Bonjour, Petit bug lorsque j'ouvre un nouveau message. Il s'ouvre mais quand je reviens sur la liste de tous les messages, il est toujours en non-lu. Il faut le réouvrir à nouveau pour le passer en lu... Le bug a lieu juste dans l'appli. Au niveau des notifications, ça marche parfaitement. Device info : Moto G (1ere génération), Android 4.4.4, TextSecure 2.3.3 App state: Push noregistered

		I've had no real problems with unencrypted MMS (except that they will not download while on wifi, which is apparently a known issue) but yesterday someone sent me an encrypted MMS (for the first time) and now TextSecure does not work at all. It crashed immediately upon attempting to open the MMS, and any time I try reopening the app, it crashes right after I enter my passphrase. I get a brief glimpse of my inbox and then the crash occurs. This behavior continues after rebooting the device. Crash log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9edfed5732bcc0665ec4 I had to clear all the app's data in order to be able to use TextSecure again...

		When I receive an encrypted MMS over the regular non-push channel, the received message says &quot;downloading...&quot; and within a few seconds, the entire app crashes and ends with an error message &quot;app closed unexpectedly&quot; or the like. When I restart the app, it crashes again within 5 seconds and unless I have quickly deleted the thread containing the offending MMS, it will continue to crash immediately upon app start.

		I uninstalled and reinstalled textsecure (trying to fix another bug, without success). Now every message I get from one of my textsecure-using contacts comes up as &quot;message encrypted for non-existing session&quot;. I'm playing around with both devices trying to sort it out, but the fact that this can even happen in the first place is definitely a bug.

		Hello, If both contacts have configured push delivery, all messages will be sent with it by default. It's good as it means free messages but some people still wants to send SMS (as not sure the contact will be connected, cf #2222). I know you can long press the send button to change the delivery for the current message but it's the default delivery method that I would like to change (I have a friend who refused to switch to TextSecure because still wanted to send SMS by default). Another way to solve it, add a discrete option next to the send button, a bit like what's done in Facebook Messenger with location. I can try to make a pull request if that's a feature you would accept (may take a bit of time though).

		I received a series of vcards interspersed with some MMS messages from one sender. At around this time, TextSecure began to crash after being open for between 10 and 40 seconds, regardless current screen or message threads having been opened. This makes it very difficult to troubleshoot as the app dies quickly after opening. I also experience previously sent vcards being posted again as if they were new messages after each crash. I browsed other currently open bugs and I saw several other MMS-related issues, but this one didn't seem to fit. Find the logcat output here, with seemingly relevant lines beginning at around 300: http://hastebin.com/uxozumujen.coffee gist link: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/505546d70c2a74a850b0 Hardware: HTC One X TextSecure: 2.3.3 Android Version: Cyanogenmod 11 M12-endeavoru

			<description>
		After I upgraded from 2.3.3 to 2.4.0 I have difficulties selecting some messages. Not all messages - it seems to be just those messages where TextSecure recognises a phonenumber in the message text. When I long-press such a message and release my finger from the screen the selection disappears. To select such a message I have to long press, don't release my finger, press another message in the thread so I select 2 messages and then short-press the last one so it leaves the selection. Update: I tested this on 2 devices, one no-name cheap Android 4.2.2 which does not have this problem. A Sony XPeria Z1 Compact with 4.4.4 does have this problem.

		Just updated to TS 2.4 and I'm having really bad stability issues (it crashes). I had never had the application stop on me in previous versions. Here are a few repeatable ways I've found to make it crash. Starting a text to certain non TS contacts. Going to the settings menu. Looking at your fingerprint. As it write this, now it crashes immediately on restarting TS, even after Rebooting the phone. Had to switch over the the default text application. I'm running a Moto G 4.4.4 with TextSecure 2.4

Sent and received an unencrypted text message or two successfully, then attempted to send an image (unencrypted). Now, app does not open, &quot;Unfortunately, TextSecure has stopped&quot; immediately thrown on attempt to access.

		I noticed that there is a checkbox for Wi-Fi calling now in the settings. At some point here Verizon will be updating more and more phones to Wi-Fi calling (&quot;Advanced Calling 1.0&quot;, as they have euhpamized). Will this be needed for all large carriers at that point for unecrypted sms? I think the Note 3 already has this.

		I wanted to send 6 photos to a friend of mine and it took forever. Sending photos over push fails WAY, WAY too often. It's a constand failure. Plus, when I &quot;resend&quot; the messages they are sent as MMS even if I have it disabled in the settings. Don't know what's wrong with textsecure but here is the log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ec2cd468fe60e523c448 Thank you

		I noticed that in a conversation with several images (or media files in general) I have to click each one to view and then return to the conversation list to view the next. I think it would be more comfortable for the user to be able to swipe (left/right) between all media items sent in this conversation, similar to the Gallery app. 👍 18

		I've just noticed that the send button remembers the selected transport (sms, sec. sms, push) but does not send immediately anymore. I find this pretty cumbersome, since one expects a send button to send a message. Also I am used to the previous behavior, namely sending on select of transport.

		Since the last update, the app icon is indicating 1 unread message (by displaying the red badge on the shortcut icon), although all messages are read. Also, when a new message is received, the badge remains &quot;1&quot;. I did not test with 2 unread messages. The interesting part in the log file seems to be this line: W/ShortcutBadger( 5874): No support for: com.sec.android.app.launcher

		Hi, I've received an MMS which crashes the app. The log from advanced settings are here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/66550f0d961145822755 I am able to write with every other contact except the one who sent me the mms. In the recent threads list, the encoded start of the mms message is displayed, when I try to open the thread the app screen turns black and crashes to home screen a few seconds later. Is there any option to delete only the &quot;damaging&quot; message? Kind regards, drohhyn Seems to be linked to #2271.

		Only confirm the delivery of a message to a group when it has been delivered to all group members. Currently, a message sent to a group is marked as delivered when at least one group member confirmed the reception (see #2260). This is not intuitive in my opinion, because it can now happen that a group message is labeled as delivered while some group members did not receive it. Reliable and intuitive group message delivery notifications are important, because it seems that GCM is not too reliable (see #2238, #2098). 👍 3 ❤️ 2

		Using Android 4.4 and a Kinesis Freestyle2 Bluetooth keyboard, I haven't been able to find any keyboard shortcuts to send after typing out the message. This issue might apply to other keyboards as well. Typically ctrl + space or ctrl + enter will send a message. Also, some applications are set up so that pushing tab will give focus to the send button, then enter or space can be used to &quot;push&quot; the button.

		From time to time, I'm receiving messages in non-chronological order. In rare cases, messages are not transmitted at all which is now better to control since we have the reception confirmation. IMO these things have to do with the server implementation but could be solved in the client and protocol by referencing to the last message ID or similar. Using the latest Android client available on Google Play store.

		Not sure if it's already there because I couldn't really test for this feature... It would be nice to have TextSecure advertise its presence in the messages to everybody (not just the people who support TextSecure) just like OTR does - by adding a whitespace to the end to the SMS. This way I wouldn't need to know if my friends use TextSecure in order to turn it on.

		When I send a message, this is the expected behavior for coloring: message turns dark blue message turns bright blue once I get the delivery receipt, its icon appears. Now, sometimes (not all the time, but pretty often), the following happens: message turns dark blue once I get the delivery receipt, its icon appears message turns bright blue I think I read somewhere that the bubble turns bright blue once the server has queued the message. So that should happen &quot;way&quot; before the delivery receipt makes its way to my phone. Since that's not the case, I think it would be cool to turn the bubble bright blue as soon as a delivery receipt is received. Otherwise you could color the bubble bright blue as soon as the message reaches the server (it would give the users the impression that messages are being sent faster, which would be good. The app seems slowish right now).

		The check mark that signals the message has been correctly sent was a very welcome feature. I recently introduced TextSecure to my father, who is 60 years old and, despite not having severe sigh problems at all in his life, at that age he needs to use glasses to read his phone (5&quot; Moto G) and has it configured with very large fonts for ease of use. In that context, we recently had minor problems with messages not arriving due to connectivity and he was unable to notice because he can barely see the check mark. I can perfectly see it in my Nexus 4 with normal fonts, but I agree it should be easier to identify. Maybe making it bigger and/or changing the character to U+2714, and maybe using a different (bright) color that helps spotting the mark way easier than it is now.

		In Chat when I click on &quot;add a picture&quot; then the &quot;Downloads&quot; folder is opened. There is no possibility to access the photo galery like in every other app. In most other apps there is an android dialogue launched &quot;complete action with...&quot; and then I can select the gallery app or any other app which fits best. Actually it would be good if both folders would be accessible, but to achieve this it would be probably better to add a &quot;add file&quot; menu item to the &quot;add attachement&quot; dialog. (And allow to select any type of file). I'm using Samsung Galaxy Note 3 on Android 4.4.2 with Textsecure 2.4.2 Regards mayerflash

		Hi So first of all, great app guys. I think this is the correct place to report this kind of behavior I was trying out the new Pushbullet OS X client and somehow noticed that I received 2 notifications when a new message arrived. I have TextSecure locked with a Passphrase. The first message/notification said &quot;encrypted message&quot; and the other one had the message itself in plain text. 😟 I thought the messages were encrypted while Textsecure is &quot;locked&quot;, am i wrong? thanks

A friend of mine sent me a picture, ant it is not displayed in the center of the message bubble. It's aligned on the left side, leaving a lot of blank space on the right.

		For a few days now, I always get a &quot;1 unread message&quot; notification after text secure locks automatically. It's always from the same contact, but there is no unread message. In fact we texted a lot in between. I can dismiss the message from the notification bar, but when I receive a message from somebody else, two unread messages appear: the new one and the &quot;always there message&quot;. Reboot did not solve the issue. Any ideas? Thanks in advance drohhyn

(I get the red triangel if I try to send MMS and I can't download other people's MMS messages). We're not on the same mobile provider but it used to work on both with default settings.

		Hello good people, sorry if this should be a duplicate. I've found a lot of issues concerned with sending or receiving problems, but nothing that quite matches my situation. The next best thing might be #2261. Here goes: When sending unencrypted SMS or encrypted Push messages to one of my contacts, I'm told that sending has failed. I asked that contact by other means to send me a message, which also failed, although he did not receive an error message, and I just received nothing at all. Afaict, only this contact is affected. Communication with all other contacts is possible by means of SMS. He is my only contact that uses / has installed Textsecure. Communication used to be possible without issues in the past (I have not communicated with this contact in a while, so I can't really say what version of TS and Android were used then, and what exactly might have changed since - sorry). As a shot in the blue, I deleted the conversation and started a new one, to no effect. Any hint or fix how to re-establish reliable communication is appreciated. Thanks in advance! My system: Cyanogenmod 11 M9 on a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini Textsecure version 2.4.2 Please let me know if more information (and what) is required.

		Hi, recently my Girlfriend (Galaxy S4, Android 4.4.2) and me (S3 mini, Android 4.1.2) both installed textsecure (2.4.2), I set it as my standard app for sms and she did not (we are both registerd for push). On Friday and Saturday she recieved what looks like encryptet SMS from me, however I did neither send those (and my phone doesn't show any sent sms), nor did she not recieve any (push) messages I did send. Since she doesn't open sms with TS, we don't know the plain text of these sms either (maybe there's method to decrypt them using our keys ?). Timestamps of push messages sent by me do not match the timestamps of her recieved sms. By now I have enable the checkbox to make TS ask me if it sends sms to another TS user, maybe that will actually resove the issue. I also tried manually sending a none encryptet sms and that works just fine. I'm not sure how to deal with this problem, my main concern is that TS may be sending SMS (I have to pay for) without me knowing about it.

		In a group chat, a member removed TextSecure or unregistered from the service.

		Recently I sent a large multipart SMS and shortly thereafter received a notification that sending failed. I tapped the notification and was brought to the just-sent message. Confusingly it had a checkmark for successful delivery. I was not yet able to confirm with the receipient whether the message actually arrived completely, but the incident shows that the UI for multipart SMS in relation to delivery notifications as well as error messages needs to be improved. I.e. a checkmark for successful delivery should only be displayed if all parts arrived, and a send error should result in the whole message being marked as failed (light background plus red triangle icon). Additionally TS should continuously try to deliver the message again (or the failed parts thereof, if the SMS protocols allow that).

		TextSecure is unable to read / check the received activation SMS. It would be cool if there would be a box to copy / type the code from the SMS into it (manual activation). Because the call activation / verification is also broken on my smartphone (Xiaocai X9 with LeWaOS / Android 4.2.1). By the way TextSecure is able to import all my old SMS. Maybe it's just a bug in the activation part.

		The textsecure-service.whispersystems.org service seems to be unavailable from my debug log here : https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8552749 I've android 4.4.4 and running all latest updates for system and also the Textsecure app. Push messaging worked until few days before, two days back I unregistered and then reinstalled application, now if I try to enable push messaging, neither sms nor phone verfikitaion works. I wondered it was my isp blocked textsecure-service.whispersystems.org , so I used my vpn account to request push registration verifikation call, still the same result, so i'm sure the problem here not in my end.

		It would be nice to have a way to create a thread that can cleans the logs automatically based on timing. Not only that, it would be good to have a way to delete messages from the thread and affect both parties, something like Twitter does with the DMs. So a message that gets deleted in a peer-thread gets deleted on the other peer-thread.

		My sister's phone wasn't able to send/recieve MMS messages so I checked things out. When I entered the manual settings that I copied from the default SMS/MMS app on her phone it worked. I believe that one setting is set wrong and all the others are ok. provider: Tušmobil WRONG: MMS Proxy: 91.185.221.085 OK: MMS Proxy: 91.185.221.85 I wanted to open Pull request and correct the setting myself but wasn't sure which is the right file to edit.

		One of these commits give me problems: 8aa0f15 18d4d4d b3c42de 5836f35 dbd8a40 I built Textsecure from source today and now I get this error message all the time: 'Permanent textsecure communication failure' and 'Textsecure was unable to register with Google Play Services. Communication over t...' and 'Update Google Play services. This app won't run unless you update Google Play services.' But the messages are not true - Textsecure is working fine. No Problems, I can send and receive via push, via SMS. I also very much doubt that my playstore services is the problem - I am using 6.1.83. The build from yesterday morning does not have this problem. So one of the above mentioned commits must cause this.

		With the latest strings added to the TextSecure project on Transifex there is no way for me to correctly translate them to my language (Slovenian). Transifex has native support for plurals but it seems it only works if the original entries are added correctly. This worked on other projects but it doesn't work with TextSecure. From the Transifex documentation: &quot;Transifex has native support for plurals, as long as the format itself supports them. Formats that can deal with plurals are for instance Gettext and Android .xml files. When Transifex encounters a pluralized entry in the file, it will associate both plural forms together. This way, Transifex can present the translator with both forms in the editor. At the same time, Transifex knows how many plural forms each language has and asks the translator to fill in all of them. That is, the translator cannot save the entry, unless he fills in all plural forms in the specified language.&quot; http://docs.transifex.com/developer/formats/

		In 2.5.0, the drop-down menu available when selecting individual messages within a thread is not readable. The menu has a light background and light text (instead of a dark background and light text), so the text is not readable. This is the menu that has &quot;resend message&quot;. The drop-down menu for the screen with the conversations list does have the appropriate light text on dark background theme. Using TextSecure 2.5.0 on Android 4.4.4.

		Hello, the app is getting better and better, I really like it. I have one small problem, I can't end a secure session, a friend has an account but he didn't use it anymore so I see him as a TS user and so I send all messages over push, if I don't send i via normal sms. When I click end secure session it sends the message that it has ended but it didn't change anything. A friend ask me if there is a support for iOS soon? I sent him the invite link over TS and a app was available but he cound't register? Thanks. Regards, Rene

		For whatever reason, TextSecure's MMS support is terrible. Everyone that I've shown TextSecure to has stopped using it because it loses MMS, crashes on receiving MMS, fails to download MMS, doesn't notify on receiving MMS, or some other long standing MMS related problem. We need an option to let the system handle MMS, while still letting TextSecure grab SMS.

		In the dark theme, open any conversation and long press in the enter text area. A menu will pop up called &quot;Edit text&quot; with options &quot;Paste&quot; and &quot;Input Method&quot; in an almost unreadable light gray color. This looks like an oversight because the default text colors work in the light theme but not in the dark, but I am just guessing.

		I know that SailfishOS is not yet (hopefully soon) a supported OS but using the playstore there to install TS and the play services TS works for sending messages to other TS instances yet I don't receive any messages. It worked a few days before so I'm not sure if 2.5.x changed something there. I understand that I don't get push notifications but at least I should get the messages when TS is running, right? I understand if nobody is willing to support me on this but I'd really like to find a workaround for this as other GCM based apps like Threema work in both directions so it should be possible. I'd provide any information needed if someone feels like helping me on this.

		I can understand why an icon might need to be statistically changed - but I believe that a complete change of colour is not user friendly. Users don't look in detail at their screen. They look for familiar shapes and colours. A sudden change like this means that users get confused. Confused users are not happy users. Examples in the wild https://twitter.com/lizconlan/status/565572218240139264 https://twitter.com/gnurpsnewoel/status/564753429449670656 https://twitter.com/boggits/status/565277848886587393 Please revert to something with the same colour as #479 - or make it a user configurable option.

		After I got the latest update including the logo change from green to blue, I noticed a discrepancy at the top of the icon, where there seems to be some noise. When I looked closer, I also spotted some potential problems on the edges, where the circle seems to have been clipped. Was this intentional? It looks like some kind of artifact.

cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
byte[] ivBytes = cipher.getIV();
 On Android 4.4, this will use a random IV. On Android 4.3, it will use zero as the IV. Refer to the following files: AttachmentCipherOutputStream.java ProvisioningCipher.java EncryptingPartOutputStream.java MasterCipher.java

		I'm not sure if this is a good place for this, but I can't find anywhere else to leave feedback on the app. After the update a couple days ago, timestamps on recent messages became relative (e.g. &quot;8 minutes ago&quot;). This conveys less information, and the alternative (e.g. &quot;12:34PM Feb. 12&quot;) doesn't take up materially more room on the screen. What does &quot;1 hour ago&quot; mean? I haven't tested it, but reasonable people could come to conclusions anywhere between 31 minutes and an hour and 59 minutes ago. I'm using a Nexus 4, Android 5.0.1.

		Sorry for the bad title, please adjust to your liking :) So right now we have, Push message (encrypted) Encrypted SMS Unencrypted SMS Would it be possible to adjust current settings (or create a new one, in like say a profile thingy?), so that if contact is offline (recipient wont receive push msg instantly), TS would automagicly use (secure) SMS instead? When I send messages I like to know that messages are actully received at the other end. With current setup I just don't know if it has, and even if we could get some kind of status icon/message it would be a lot nice if this is handled automaticly Thoughts? :)

		Presently, when one selects a language from the list inside Language settings, it just directly switches to that language. Imagine the panic on the mind of normal average user when he sees a language he accidentally tapped on (and don't know it) and wants to revert to previous (or English) language. It should ask &quot;do you want to switch to LanguageName?&quot;

		Often, when I receive group messages, some of the messages do not make it to the group chat screen. Instead, they arrive as what appears to be a non-group MMS seperate from the group chat with no contents other than a dowload button. If I click the download button and stay on that screen, the message eventually makes it to the group chat screen. However, the messages tends to show in the order that they've been dowloaded, not sent, which makes comprehending the conversation difficult. This problem appears to only occur with messages from non-TextSecure users, although I cannot say for sure. Only one of my contacts uses TextSecure.

		Hi folks, when i try to select an attachment (picture) at the conversation while pressing &quot;ON&quot; the picture, it gets marked but as soon i release my finger from the screen the picture automaticly gets unmarked. After repeating the following steps 5-6 times he finally catched my selection. BUT! When i mark next to the picture, on the blank screen, it gets marked immediately. U need a log for this?

		Running the latest TextSecure on an LG Optimus F3Q, I am no longer able to focus the button to compose a new message using the keyboard on the phone. I seem to have no trouble focusing any other elements on the screen, I just can't find this button. I was able to focus the button in the previous version, but I can no longer find it with my arrow keys as of today. I was able to find it by exploring the screen with my finger using both Talkback and Spiel screen readers, but in both cases, the button has no label associated with it, and is now presented to me as simply &quot;button.&quot; In order to make best use of this app using my screen reader, the button needs to have a content description associated with it that would allow me to know what the button does. If possible, it should also be able to be focused using a hardware keyboard, whether built in or external.

		I installed Text Secure on my Galaxy Note 3, Android 4.4.4 and now the native Messaging SMS app will not let me send messages from it. It fills the text box with &quot;cannot send messages&quot; Also, Text Secure and the native Android Messaging app both ask if I want to set them as default when I use either. I have a Galaxy S3 and neither TS or Messaging ask for a default.

		I had some problems with the MMS settings of my provider so I tried some of the settings of TextSecure. Thereby I discovered that when I'm deleting an MMS (a picture) I wanted to send and receiving a message with an included picture,TextSecure shows me the deleted picture in the stream. Clicking on the image opens the right image.

		I have enabled to be asked if I want to fallback to SMS if a push message can't be sent. Sometimes just the reception is bad or I type a message in the elevator. I don't want to send it via SMS, I just want to retry to send it over PUSH after I leave the elevator for example. So the SMS fallback popup should have another options to retry via PUSH.

		In conversation mode, I long press send button to change from push message to secure sms. Message is delivered successfully. If I leave conversation and come back, the send button has now been reset to push mode. Perhaps it should remember the last delivery type on a global or per conversation basis?

		I recently installed Textsecure for the first time and was expecting to be asked about &quot;passphrase&quot; after searching the usual setup steps. I was asked about my phone number and got registered. I was also asked about importing the existing messages to Textsecure and setting up the app as my main sms app. However, any time that I am trying to use it, the lock beside my send arrow is open. I am not sure what I have done wrong or whether my friends should install it before having a secure text conversation. I understand that the project is dynamic but &quot;It is not easy to find a fast setup guide online.&quot;

		Hello, I've read whole mailing list thread discussing and few tickets here on github of TextSecure, that explains that the feature is now gone. If I understand it correctly, in the same manner as RedPhone the feature of end-to-end encryption of SMS now works only if TextSecure is used with GCM/APN (textsecure-backend + signal-ios). If that's correct, would it be possible to bring this feature back as optional feature in application settings? I'm willing to invest time into putting the feature back into code, if the team of developers agree with it being put back in official releases on Google Play. I think that application with such large community is able to push the feature forward better, than forcing users to choose between TextSecure PUSH and eg. Tinfoil SMS GSM solution, using non-compatible ciphers (see the tinfoil-sms issue 70 [3]). Also using mobile networks is not reliable, as can be seen in many tickets here on github, as well as just thinking about Roaming cost and/or using textsecure on poor connectivity/without network connectivity. Related links: 1: https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/whispersystems/2015-01/msg00022.html 2: WhisperSystems#1762 3: tinfoilhat/tinfoil-sms#70 (comment) 4: WhisperSystems#2137

		I was asked to put this question to http://support.whispersystems.org/ but there I got no answer. So I will restate the question here: A friend of mine has the problem that he doesn't receive TextSecure messages when he isn't on a wifi connection but on mobile network. For me that works fine. Does anyone have an idea how to solve this issue?

		Hi all! I'm running text secure 2.5.3 on a Moto G (XT1033 falcon_asia_ds). Running android 5.0 (LXB22,46-28). I'm using the app primarily as a texting replacement as none of my contacts use Text Secure. Debug log I've noticed that time stamps are extremely slow in updating. If I've sent a text, then navigated out of the app, then go back into the app after a number of minutes, chances are the time stamp shows &quot;now&quot; or &quot;1 min&quot; or whatever. The time stamp only updates after maybe 10-20 seconds. I've never noticed this problem on any other texting app.

		I am having significant reliability problems with TextSecure. I have installed the latest version along with two other users, and we all have enabled push messaging. With one user, there are no issues at all. We both appear in each other's list of TextSecure users, and can both send each other TextSecure messages. The second user also can send TextSecure messages to and receive TextSecure messages from the first user with no errors. What doesn't work is sending messages between myself and the second user. We do both appear in each other's list of TextSecure users, but his only option to send a message is &quot;Send secure SMS&quot; (no option to send a TextSecure message). I do have the option to send a TextSecure message (and it is the default, of course), but most of those that I do just show up as &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; on the other end (and all of the messages sent to this user take about twenty minutes to show up, whether the message actually makes it there, or there is just a &quot;Bad encrypted mesage&quot; notice). I don't understand why this isn't working, and don't have any idea about how to troubleshoot the problem.

I'll hold down my finger in the text box, and the copy/paste dialog will either not pop up at all, or it will appear briefly, but disappear before it can be used. However, it works just fine if the text field has any text in it. Can anybody reproduce this on their model?

		I am using TextSecure only as a messenger, not for unencrypted SMS. After having my SIM transferred to another phone, thus creating new key pairs, it sent messages to a TS contact via SMS, instead of doing its key exchange thing in the background. Is it supposed to do that? I'd rather have it show me some way to exchange the keys again and send messages via PUSH, than to blow up my SMS contingent. (Android 5.0, Motorola Moto X 2014/XT1092)

		Would it be possible to implement polling (e.g. every 15 minutes) until websocket support is available? I use this on Threema and it's almost as good as push and there is no heavy battery drainage. The load on the server shouldn't be too heavy as only few people are not using GCM. I really would like to switch to TextSecure, but as many others won't install Google Services for it.

		Created contact with two phone numbers. First phone number does not have TextSecure capabilities (not a smartphone). Second phone number has text secure and is registered for push messages. TextSecure (option selected to use TextSecure as the default SMS application) correctly creates two threads (one for each of the numbers) and can receive TextSecure messages from the second number. However, when attempting to send messages to the second number , only the &quot;Send unsecure SMS&quot; and &quot;Send secured SMS&quot; options are presented, so TextSecure messages can not be sent to the second number. Moving the second number to a new contact allows TextSecure to present the option to send TextSecure messages. Moving the second number back into one contact again prevents the &quot;Send TextSecure message&quot; option from being displayed.

		On my LG G2 smartphone, TextSecure is having problems associating my contacts to the conversations. Instead of using the contact image and name it will show the standard &quot;happy face&quot; and the phonenumber the conversation is related to, as if I did not have any contact stored for this number. It should be noted that many of the conversations are correctly associated with the correct contact and thus shows both image and name from the contact. It seems to be rather random what contacts are effected by this bug. I have also seen conversations that was previously associated with the correct contact &quot;forget&quot; this ones a new message arrives, and just show the &quot;happy face&quot; and number instead. I have tried updated the contacts and adding the phonenumber to them again (even adding them several times to the same contact). In some rare cases this made the contact show up correctly, but normally it does not fix anything. I have not been able to find a common course for the problem yet. It does not matter if a contact have only one or several phonenumbers. Also note that the standard message app on the phone works as it should, and shows all conversations with the correct contacts.

		Good evening TextSecure Developers and hi @mcginty! I am not sure why you guys had to change the color of the App Icon (always loved the green Icon), but maybe you could correct the Icon to be exactly round shaped like the previous one? I know this sounds nitpicky, but I am a perfectionist and stuff like this is ticking me off after a while. Thank you for caring! 👍

With lollipop, I now see notifications on the lock screen which is good, but I also have the &quot;TextSecure is unlocked&quot; notification always there. Is there a way to remove it aside from silencing all notification for the app ? Thanks, Maxime

		First of all: Your work is absolutly awesome and my friends and i are very very thankful to be able to collaborate so easy, secure and undisturbed over the Internet! When we work on projects for university we use a Textsecure group. And because we want to decide democratically on steps our group takes, dates of meetings or find out whos comming to an event we use doodle.com a lot. It cant be done soon, but we would love to see a poll feature some day (maybe like Threema has implemented it). Perhaps in Signal for Android version 4.0 :o) Because communication is the basis of everthing and your apps are all about communication, i think this feature would be fantastic! Thank you so much! And keep on having fun with this great project! 👍 1

		In group chats the scrolling behavior of TextSecure is unfavorable in my opinion. When I reopen a group chat after absence it is always scrolled all the way down to the most recent message. So in a group chat with a lot going on I have to manually scroll up to the point where I left the chat each time. Could this be fixed easily? For most of my friends this is the main show stopper that keeps us from moving our group from whatsapp.

		If you click on choose contacts you see the list which stars with all the TextSecure contacts followed by all non-TS contacts. Of course there is also the search function which makes it easier to select a contact, but I recommend to add tabs for: TextSecure contacts | Groups | non-TS contacts

		The Hebrew and Indonesian translation are not working. values-he should be renamed to values-iw and values-id should be renamed to values-in I didn't want to make a PR because I don't know how the transifex integration is working... From lint: ../../res/values-he: The locale folder &quot;he&quot; should be called &quot;iw&quot; instead; see the java.util.Locale documentation ../../res/values-id: The locale folder &quot;id&quot; should be called &quot;in&quot; instead; see the java.util.Locale documentation Priority: 6 / 10 Category: Correctness Severity: Warning Explanation: Wrong locale name. From the java.util.Locale documentation: &quot;Note that Java uses several deprecated two-letter codes. The Hebrew (&quot;he&quot;) language code is rewritten as &quot;iw&quot;, Indonesian (&quot;id&quot;) as &quot;in&quot;, and Yiddish (&quot;yi&quot;) as &quot;ji&quot;. This rewriting happens even if you construct your own Locale object, not just for instances returned by the various lookup methods. Because of this, if you add your localized resources in for example values-he they will not be used, since the system will look for values-iw instead. To work around this, place your resources in a values folder using the deprecated language code instead. More info: http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html

		The ConversationActivity currently uses isSms() as the value for the &quot;forceSms&quot; argument to MessageSender. This isn't accurate, since it means that undiscovered contacts won't be looked up before delivery. Also, I missed it in my first review, but SendButton shouldn't have a reference to the compose EditText.

		Splitting this out from @brwolfgang's #2582 request for clickable phone numbers. It also would be nice if TS would identify the number in text body using my local contacts list and instead of showing the unrecognizable sequence of numbers it showed a (clickable) contact name. A SMS example: Você recebeu ligações de: 04111123451234 16:59hs A processed SMS example: Você recebeu ligações de: : Dad 16:59hs Blocked on #2582.

		I'm in a similar boat to #1909 - I registered for OWS using a self-built RedPhone APK (because installing Google Apps to use a privacy system? What?), and now I find that I cannot (months later) subscribe to WhisperPush on CM11/12. I have been happily using a self-compiled TextSecure and did not miss the data channel because screw installing Spyware in order to use Privacy apps, but now that Signal opens up a realm of iPhone recipients I'm making an effort to get a data channel that's even halfway trustworthy: WhisperPush. When I try to subscribe by phone number, I get &quot;push server not reachable&quot;. My dad installed Signal and sees my wife and I as valid recipients, indicating that we're registered, which must be due to the prior Redphone experimentation. Reading around it seems that you can only be de-registered by uninstalling the app through Google Play, which is something I wish were made clear in the Github Readme for Redphone. Is installing Google Play only to install Redphone and then Uninstall Redphone and then be left with a google backdoor the only way I have available to register for WhisperPush?

		I'm writing this in hope of you deciding to keep the MMS/SMS support. My personal experience of using the push messages has been poor. Too many times has my messages never arrived to the person I'm trying to contact. This problem has been catastrophic when the arrival of the message was critical. Even worse when it's a urgent message that needs quick response, this has occurred to me on several occasions; which in turn caused me some troubles (Multiple times)! Personally I can not describe me experience with regular SMS anywhere near as poor as the push messages. With regard to the poor experience with the push messages service and the severe limitations of the current plans; I do not believe your reasons warrant reason to remove support for MMS/SMS. I would rather have MMS/SMS only and drop the push messages. Worth mentioning: currently contacting friends who're out of the country renders TextSecure virtually useless because no one currently has the data plan enabled while roaming. Keeping it on MMS/SMS mode circumvents this problem. Regarding polling of new members; I don't see why the app still doesn't check for new contacts while using the MMS/SMS service, this can be worked around... Since I've had a poor experience with the push messages on several occasions; I've been using TextSecure as a MMS/SMS client which had support for OTR, I had it all working in one single app. If MMS/SMS is dropped from TextSecure; I'll likely discontinue my use of TextSecure.

		Hi, when I want to send a secure message to one of my contacts with sms and not over the internet I'm supposed to go to settings and disable &quot;Textsecure-Messages&quot;. After that my messages are transported with sms. But when I want to send them over the internet I'm supposed to register again by textsecure. So I would request a feature that I can select in a conversation how the message is transported.

		Please consider adding a beta channel over Google Groups (or G+). Phased roll-outs really make sense, I get that. I would really like to not have to wait days until I get the new version. Especially right now, when many critical features are being added, like the move from GCM to your own delivery channel. Also I'm willing and capable to provide feedback and logs, I'm guessing I'm not the only one.

		Hi there, one Member of our Groupchat uninstalled the TextSecure App (Signal for iOS) without leaving the Group first. He is still listed. Now for every message the leftover members send to the Group, we get the notification that the message could not be delivered. So I guess this should be recognized and handled by the app in some way.

		I notice awhile back that when you send a message, it immediately gets a date &quot;Now&quot; and then the privacy level of a lock icon. Then when the delivery receipt comes back, the &quot;Now text slides left and the box with the check for delivery appears between the &quot;Now&quot; and the lock. I have two ideas: Currently: Now{lock_icon} Now{checked_box}{lock_icon} Idea 1: Now{space}{lock_icon} Now{checked_box}{lock_icon} Idea 2: Now{unchecked_box}{lock_icon} Now{checked_box}{lock_icon} If nothing else, creating this issue allows you to say &quot;it's in the backlog&quot; if anyone else suggests similar. 😄

		Would it be possible to visually combine incoming and outgoing messages from the same user into one message? I think it wastes a lot of space if there is the name and icon for the user with each message. All the messages that were sent 7 minutes ago could be combined into one if no other user has sent anything inbetween. Each message in a new line.

		Hello, a friend of mine has an older Smartphone with Android 4.1.2 on it. She is not able to afford a new phone so easily. The latest TextSecure version available for this Android version is only 2.5.3. This raises some questions: a) Did newer versions of TextSecure, drop support for older APIs? b) If older API versions are not supported, why hasn't it been announced? c) TextSecure 2.5.3 is not able to send pictures (text messages are working). I this cause support has been dropped or should a bug been filed (incompatible server change?)

An additional indication when the recipient has read the message (maybe like iMessage?) would be nice. Users should probably be able to opt into (or out of?) sending read receipts. (See #866.)

		In 2.7.0+, now that encrypted SMS is no longer a thing, some of the strings for settings are a bit confusing. In particular, there should no longer be a distinction between &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot; SMS settings. I'm also not sure about the description of the Push message setting, given that it's the primary feature of the app. Maybe change it to &quot;Disable TextSecure messages&quot; or something?

		In version 2.7.0, secure SMS functionality has been removed. When composing a new message, TS still displays Send unsecured SMS. Since there is no longer a secured SMS, this might confuse new users. Perhaps it would be best to change it to Send SMS, or change it somehow to reflect that TextSecure messages are secure and SMS is not.

But when TextSecure locks again (also by timeout) I get a new notification. I think this bug appears since the last update.

		Sometimes you maybe forced to hand out your password to people like government agencies. In this case it would be really nice to have a second fake password. This fake password will only give acces to some fake messages which dont contain any informations that you try to keep secret. Basically like an hidden truecrypt volume.

		I really dislike your latest decision to stop support for encrypted SMS/MMS. Not because I don't like push messages - I simply do not want to install google services. In my opinion it makes your whole effort for encrypted communications a farce - but this is just my point of view. Now I read in your blog that you are going to handle message delivery by yourselves. This is really nice. One thing though: You want to go for GCM for wakeup events - That means GCM would be mandatory for TextSecure. What about using a different mechanism - a periodically check, manual check, whatever. As long as GCM would be optional I would be very glad, lot's of other ppl possibly as well and this would be a good compromise for the gone encrypted SMS. So, would you please consider making GCM for wake up events optional while providing encrypted push through your own services without the need of google services? Would really appreciate that. Thanks.

		Hi! I re-flashed my Nexus 5 from rooted stock ROM KitKat 4.4 to CyanogenMod 12 (cm-12-20150308-NIGHTLY-hammerhead, based on Android 5.0.2). Before flashing, I made a TitaniumBackup Pro backup also from TextSecure in order to migrate my private key as well as the settings I would have lost otherwise. Basically, TextSecure v2.5.3 is working after restoring via TitaniumBackup Pro on CM12. What works: sending encrypted PUSH messages sending encrypted text messages sending unencrypted text messages receiving encrypted text messages receiving unencrypted text messages However, some things are not working any more, most annoying: I can not receive any encrypted push messages: What stopped working: receiving encrypted PUSH messages notifications that my PUSH messages arrived at my peers TextSecure I don't think that my issues are related to CM12 nightly since text messages (encrypted or unencrypted) are working fine. I don't use any Android firewall or Android permission overruling settings/app (yet).

Try sending and receiving via that app successfully (via GV data). Set TextSecure as default. Receving works fine, but sending gets stuck, with long-press msg details showing: Sent - Via Pending... (I wasn't trying on totally fresh phone wipe, but I can retry that later if it would uncomplicate things.) Expected Behaviour It seemed that the Voice+ system app allowed any regular SMS app to send/receive using Google Voice. I'll have to look into how TS might act differently. EDIT: cc @lachesis since you seemed interested once upon a time :)

		I'm using TextSecure to write messages to contacts in different languages. The problem is that the auto completion of the built-in keyboard gets in the way when using the keyboard for wrong language (e.g. writing German on an English keyboard). It is already very useful that I can change the language of the keyboard by holding down the space bar. Requested feature: However, it would be really nice if TesxtSecure could remember for each contact which language I'm using with it and automatically switch to the correct keyboard when I start writing a message to a contact. That would save me from switching the keyboard manually (which I realize I need to do usually only after it garbled my first sentence to gibberish). Is that possible? What do others think?

		I don't know how to describe this issue, which seems to arise randomly. Sometimes one of the members of the group would send a message that just doesn't reach all the other members. I don't know how else to explain this, and I haven't seen a pattern so far. Some messages just get lost. I would suggest more testing of group chats (all members are running the latest version). Thank you

		Base data TextSecure version: 2.6.4 Device: Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini (GT-I9195)) Android version: 4.4.2 (vendor ROM) Relevant settings: Push registered and enabled Incoming SMS enabled (use TS as standard app) Outgoing SMS to text secure contacts when there is no internet access available (fallback). Ask before sending. Detailed description of issue Since the update to TS 2.6.4 the fallback from Push to SMS (if there is no internet connection available) has stopped working. When I send the push, the message comes up as normal (&quot;Do you want to use SMS...?&quot;). If I confirm that I want to use SMS, the message turns to the usual green, indicating SMS mode, but after a while switches to blue (Push message). If I look into the &quot;Message details&quot; screen, it too says that it used the Push data channel. (As a footnote: the &quot;Message details&quot; screen doesn't respect the displkay/design options as well. I have TS set to the dark theme, the &quot;Message details&quot; screen, however, uses the bright theme. Maybe this contributes to the problem.) It's not just a display issue either: TS does use the push data channel although I tell it to do SMS. Once I turn on the internet connection, the message is delivered via push to the recipient (they confirm that they received them).

		Ok folks, with todays update of TextSecure to version 2.7.1 the real disappointment happened: Only unencrypted conversations are still possible, we are forced to register! You silently removed encrypted SMS (not mentioned on GooglePlay)! TextSecure Messages are NOT possible without Google Play Services. So that means: Phones of privacy-aware users that are very likely rooted and have no Google Play Services are being &quot;set on fire&quot; by just disabling the encryption of all conversations, not notifying the user that the whole encryption thingy has just vanished. Furthermore, people are being forced to register with the TextSecure Messages Server based in the USA. The people (like me) who refuse to flash GApps for adding Google Play Services (because they know that with those services you enable Google to remotely monitor your phone) are just doomed in this case. @moxie0, I've always loved TextSecure and RedPhone, but this is just unacceptable for privacy-aware people like me. I wonder what wistleblowers would say to this. Nevermind, I already complained too much. Uninstalled. Good bye. 😢

		Hi there, I just posted a message in a group that couldn't be delivered due to crapy connection on my side. So the little red exclamation mark appeared next to the message, and when I clicked it I was offered a list of all group members with a resend button next to each name. I figured I had to click each button to make sire everbody received my meaningful braindump. But it turns out that every button seams to resend the message to the entire group. So everybody received 15 times the same message. Could the resending not be handled automatically?

		I have supported TextSecure since the beginning, version 1.0. I started using it because it was a way to encrypt SMS messages. Now, it is just another encrypted IM chat program, unable to do SMS, and its original point its lost. It should not be called TextSecure anymore... Call it &quot;Signal for Android&quot; or something and fork TextSecure at version 2.6... I do not have a data plan. I do not have google apps installed. I can not use my favorite app anymore. I was SO ANGRY today and also so sad because something i loved just died. Moxie, you are making a HUGE mistake. Some people don't want to use Gapps. Some people don't have a data plan. Some people travel through areas where they can't get data but the standard SMS channel is available. Some people don't want to use limited data when they can use their unlimited SMS plan. These people were just told to go fuck themselves. I feel offended, insulted, hurt. These people are probably either highly security-conscious users who don't trust google or people who just don't want a data plan... they are not the enemy, Moxie, they WERE loyal users of TextSecure. You could still develop the push system without taking away the SMS fallback system. There should at least be a fallback system. And for security, what protects us from man-in-the-middle attacks now? If keys can be reissued whenever what stops a man-in-the-middle from distorting the keys to trigger a new swap then capturing the new keys? I don't feel comfortable with the push system even if I could use it. THIS IS A TEXT MESSAGING APP, not a damn chat program. I DONT CARE IF THE TELCOS HAVE METADATA ON ME. Why do you think you can force me to care about that? I care much more about not having Gapps on my phone. It is a sad day... so sad.

		Since version 2.7 or so, TextSecure has become very unreliable. Half the messages I should receive don't come through unless I deactivate/reactivate data. So every couple of hours I have to disconnect/reconnect my phone to receive all the messages that were queued on the server but never reached my phone (for some reason). This kind of problem seemed to have been fixed for a while, but now we're back to old times. I'm running 2.8 and it's still happening

		hi. i made the mistake of updating textsecure to the latest version on google play (as of today) and now every time i open it there's a huge blue nag screen section right at the top. there is no way to close it, like in the previous version. dear developers. for the love of god. why? i will never ever ever enable textsecure messages, because (in no particular order, they're all important equally): sms is free and unlimited i only rarely connect to wifi sms is free and unlimited i don't want to register my phone number sms is free and unlimited the people i talk to using textsecure only connect to wifi rarely sms is free and unlimited in previous versions there was the option to disable the nag screen, and even then it was temporary. when you least expected it it popped back up. why? for those who don't need or want this feature, why are you trying to push it down the throat? i really appreciate the time and effort you (the devs) put into this app but why are you trying so hard to turn into google, facebook and the like? i thought textsecure was about freedom of expression and freedom of choice. was i wrong?

		Sender's Device: LG G3 running Lolipop, TextSecure 2.6.4 / 2.7.1 (not sure) Receiver's Device: Nexus 5 running Lolipop, TextSecure 2.7.1 Issue details: An existing TextSecure user switched to a new phone and installed TextSecure on it The user sent a message to an existing group member which accepted his new identity then added him to the group. Other group members did not yet approve his new identity. Whenever the user with a new identity sends a message to the group, users who didn't yet accept his new identity receive a &quot;private chat notification&quot; asking them to confirm his unknown identity or cancel. after confirming each &quot;confirm identity&quot; notification, the message which was supposed to be delivered to the group is delivered to the private chat instead of group chat. no idea about future messages, but i believe they would be delivered normally to the group after confirming the identity.

I found this question more than once, but no official answer, just guesses. Any updates on this topic? Regards Mawed EDIT: Sorry I did not meant to open a discussion. It was meant more like a &quot;feature&quot; request. (Maybe it is plant to be on Version 3.0, regardless how much steps between there will be....)

		I recently got a S5 and the keyboard has a textual-smiley-button (&quot;:-)&quot;, etc.) but the emoji button can only be reached by changing the &quot;,&quot; button to the left of the spacebar, which is very inconvenient. See the attached screenshot. The option to change the emoji-button to an enter-button changes the textual-smiley-button, so I guess TS wants the emoji-button, but the Samsung keyboard sets the textual-smiley-button instead. Can this be controlled through TS?

		Textsecure 2.7.1 Samsung SGH-T399 Android 4.2.2 When setting up a passphrase, textsecure accepts a passphrase that is zero characters long. From a usability standpoint and to avoid confusion, it seems like we should require passphrases to be at least one character long. What do people think?

		Kill the gapps (google) dependancies. Folk with hardened roms like to be gapps free, and those who have hardened roms are gapps free for a very good reason. By making your app gapps free, both types of user can use your app, those who &quot;trust&quot; google, and those who trust themselves.

		TS user on 2.5.3, which is registered, sends me TS message. To this message, I can't reply. Moxie closed the issue #2730 with explanation, that the first user is not registered... but he is. In his contact list he sees his TS users and is able to send them TS message (not encrypted SMS). In my case, after receiving the message, I have the option to reply (TS - blue arrow, not SMS) but the message is not sent. Afterwards the blue arrow vanishes and I am offered to send only normal SMS.

		Hangouts is the default Google chat client, and most people I know communicate via gtalk rather than sms. ChatSecure is very rough compared to TextSecure, and it's repelling to non-tech-savvy users to have 2 clients. Consider supporting XMPP in TextSecure too, so we can use the one client for messaging, as a full and transparent replacement for Google Hangouts?

		When one is using the dark theme, a thread with new messages is highlighted in addition to the bolded font. However when the light theme is being used, there is no highlight to indicate there are new messages, only bolded font. I read/heard some users complaining the bolded font is not distinct enough, especially in situations with bad readability(sunny weather etc.) Making both themes have the same properties would be desirable anyway and helps visibility as well.

		Hello, when being in a chat in TextSecure and then leaving TextSecure (i.e. going to home screen for example) and then going back to TextSecure, TextSecure goes to the contact list instead of going back to the chat. That's quite annoying. Could you please fix that and make TextSecure go back to the chat? It would be much appreciated. Regards

		Hello, the current TextSecure-Android version does have gray and blue message bubbles. I do not really like that and find it uncomfortable to read with those colors, especially with the current choice of the chat background color (WhisperSystems#2773). Could you please add an option to change the message bubble colors? Oh, and before you say &quot;But we need those colors to indicate which kind of messaging channel is being used (Data/SMS) and to indicate if the messages are encrypted or not!&quot; or something like that (WhisperSystems#945), let me say this: I don't think colors should be used for that. I think those things should rather be indicated via icons, not via message bubble colors. And I don't use TextSecure for SMS anyway (IMHO TextSecure should have removed the entire SMS support, both, encrypted as well as unencrypted). It would be much appreciated if you could add an option to change the message bubble colors. Regards

		Just installed TextSecure on my wife's phone but left it with SMS and MMS disabled by default until we could configure everything and transition her over. However, just today, she got group MMS messages from friends that were unable to be downloaded in her default MMS app. Upon investigation, opening TextSecure, I saw those messages downloaded in TextSecure even though it shouldn't have. It appears somehow TextSecure is pulling down MMS when it shouldn't. It wasn't all messages in the thread, which left some messages in the default MMS app and others inside TextSecure for some reason. Samsung Galaxy S3 CDMA, Android 4.4.2.

		I noticed the following behavior with Push Messages: When having limited or no Internet connection while someone sends you a message, the message gets delivered multiple times after the connection is restored. I don't know about the inner workings of TextSecure but is it possible, that TextSecure tries to resend the Message after some time has passed without a receipt? If so, then maybe the received messages should be checked by using some kind of unique ID so duplicates can be deleted automatically.

		I'm really missing the &quot;seen&quot; indicator which is available at Threema (eye symbol). This inform me, when the recipient of the message really have red the message. It makes me sure that really the recipient has received the message, not only his mobile. This makes sending an acknowledgment back (e.g. &quot;OK&quot;) superfluous. Additionally a setting is probably needed to deactivate sending these &quot;seen&quot;-indicator for those, who don't want this behaviour and keep their privacy.

		Please add an option to switch between Textsecure-mode and SMS-mode, like there is one in hangouts (by Google). There may be some cases where sending an SMS is preferable although both parties have Textsecure. Lets make an example: In case one side has no internet connection (e.g. in foreign contries) but may recieve SMSs. It would be great to be able to sent the person this message through Textsecure especially because this app aims to replace the default SMS-App.

		Hello, I've vouched for this feature a lot, so I'll just write it here as a feature request hoping someone would take it seriously. We're a group of activists in an oppressive regime, trying to establish an IM-type of secure medium to communicate our initiatives among each other. TextSecure has been, theoretically, the ideal medium for us for so long. Yet, we never used it because it requires Phone Numbers. Hashed or not, our problem with that is not a &quot;trust&quot; problem against the server, but the problem is that if one of us is searched/caught, there's absolutely zero plausible deniability for him to deny his immediate knowledge if the people he's communicating with. The oppressor can simply collect the phone numbers I have on my phone (after a good beating to make me unlock the app from its passphrase), and take down all of the group. We need the ability to use usernames (preferably also making an option to FORCE Tor before the app can download or upload ANYTHING). That way, if one is caught, he won't be (as much of) a danger to us all, as if he had all our phone numbers in the chat screen. He will be able to use his cover story to deny and save us and maybe even himself. Please consider that. We're struggling to get a secure medium for our communication. XMPP is not the way to go when it comes to Group Chat, and other Closed Source apps are just never the correct go-to app. This app is absolutely perfect, if only it allows us to completely get rid of phone numbers. Not just for people whom I don't have their phone numbers, but even for my contacts that are in my phone book. We need a way to not reference phone numbers in TextSecure AT ALL. Please make it happen. If I had what I could benefit you with, I'd gladly offer it, but unfortunately I'm not able to offer anything back to this great community of developers.

		I noticed after installation that when I receive messages, it didn't make a sound, it only flashed the notification light. I go to Settings -&gt; Notifications, and I can see &quot;Sound = Argon&quot; is displayed. I press on 'Sound', which takes me to the sound selection list, but here there is none selected. I now select Argon from the list, back in settings it says &quot;Sound = Argon&quot; as before, but from now the app is making notification sounds. My colleague also had the same problem.

		WhisperPush user sends message, comes in as SMS TS user replies with data message --&gt; fails tap for unsecure SMS --&gt; says &quot;message will not be encrypted...&quot;, but sends TS data message (at least colors and details says so) TS only allows SMS after that then WhisperPush user sends message, comes in as data message TS user replies with push (enabled again) --&gt; fails tap for unsecure SMS --&gt; sends TS push message TS only allows SMS after that ...and so on. Data and SMS message arive just fine on the WhisperPush device

		All popular messengers have the Option to open the camera to capture a photo and send directly it without the need to leave the APP and without the need to save it first somewhere. Is this something already on your list? I find threemas implementation oft this nice. They added &quot;camera&quot; to the list of of file types.

		In some travel situations I have only GSM network access, allowing voice and SMS, but NOT data plans. I need to be able to use encryption over regular SMS transport. (Also, I would like to be able to enable or disable the use of TextSecure transport in the settings, without having the annoying pop up always appearing and trying to force me to use it.)

		I can't send SMS, when I do it just sits there (sometimes for hours). No red triangle, no error... just sits there. I thought this was because of &quot;delivery reports&quot;, but toggling this has no effect on sending SMS. This doesn't always happen. Sometimes SMS works just fine, but for the most part, it just sits there. I don't know if this is a TextSecure issue or an issue with my phone (or provider) in general. Not sure if this log has anything useful in it: https://gist.github.com/22a283d889ab9c8d15b0 P.S. I was having MMS issues before, so I don't know if that's related.

		In the past i have been able to use TextSecure to encrypt my SMS without having be online at all times. Recently i lost the ability to communicate by encrypted SMS with a lot of people close to me because they got their TextSecure updated. So i had to install some of the most intrusive of the Google Apps to be able to update Textsecure - only to find out that it doesn't do encrypted SMS any longer. I just can not understand how Open Whisper Systems can deliver us to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and its constant tracking when this opens us to abuse by all the three letter agencies that we now know about thanks to Snowden. Please reenable key exchange and encrypted messaging using SMS.

		TextSecure 2.9.2 Android 4.4.2 Samsung SGH-T399 When verifying a phone number, there is no way to cancel if you are having issues, except by clicking on &quot;Edit +[phone number]&quot; and then exiting from that screen. The physical back button on my phone doesn't work either. I'd suggest adding a back arrow on the upper bar to return to the previous activity. Maybe the back button should only be visible when text message registration fails? Attached is a picture of the activity.

Though, there is a workaround: touch and hold untild the image message is selected/marked and now move finger while still holding some way up or down until scrolling has been triggered. Now release - selection should be still active.

		I don't know how long, but today (newest textsecure update from playstore) I realised that I could not send encrypted sms anymore. My wife has textsecure too (android 5.0 too) and we only wanna use it for encrypted sms (push messages not activated). But till now we could only send unencrypted sms and there is no way to reenable the encryption. Also for other contacts which use plain sms apps, there is not even a way to try to start a secure sms chat. I only could send an invitation to install the app.

		I'm not absolutely sure, but I think in some former version of TS (maybe before dropping encrypted SMS) TS would aks if it should fall back to SMS if no data connection was detected. I have an ongoing chat with a friend where this happended when I send him a message and had not data connection at that moment. Today I tried the same (send a message to a TS contact while no data connection available) with this results: TS does not ask what to do TS wants to send a encrypted message which will never succeed as long as device is offline TS seems to have no timeout, so even after waiting for verly long no fallback to SMS Sending manually a SMS is bad for 2 reasons: First - normaly I dont want to use SMS, so I intuitivly I want to just send a message thinking it will go out over data channel. Second - I had to use this issue-tracker to find out how to accomplish sending a SMS within an ongoing encrypted chat.... its kind of hidden.) Suggestion: just ask the user via a pop-up what to do in situations where no data connection is available: Send over SMS right away (only unencrypted) Wait and send encrypted as soon as data connection becomes available (additionally: remember decision for this chat/for all chats)

		Since the secure SMS option is removed. To reduce the confusion, can we remove insecure SMS option too? Also remove the ability to capture incoming SMS and storing it. This will make it a clear that TextSecure is data based messaging App only and has nothing to do with SMS.

To reproduce: Share some text to TextSecure (via some other app's &quot;Share&quot; functionality) TextSecure will show the &quot;Share with&quot; menu with some contacts (and a plus button) Tap a contact (or tap the plus button and select one from the list) The contact's thread will open (or if it was a new contact, a new thread will be created), but the shared text won't be prefilled in the text box. Android 4.4.4 (CM11), commit 0ff9925 .

		First, are you some kind of fascists? Why did you lock #2847 ? Second, why TS cant's send encrypted SMS anymore? I tough it can. I wanted to communicate securely with certain person which doesn't want to use Internet often but we both have free SMS. I tough TS is perfect solution for us. Can this be solved somehow?

		Tapping on a TextSecure notification with multiple senders now opens something that says it's a group chat with 0 members, rather than opening to the ConversationList. I assume this is a regression caused by the RoutingActivity change. I don't know what happens if you try to respond in that group thread, but it can't be good. We should probably try to get a 2.10.1 out asap.

		For some reason it's apparently not uncommon to get the generally well-known &quot;invalid package&quot; error ONLY with TextSecure, recently. I can seemingly install/update any other applications marked as compatible in the Google Play Store (that I've tried so far) on my devices just fine. Both myself and another user have reported this on support.whispersystems.com, in http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/11557972-version-mismatch-messages-unreadable-with-automatic-updates-from-google-play-at-both-ends and http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/11567106-invalid-package-error-on-install . I have three Android 2.3.x devices exhibiting this behaviour, two Samsung GT-S5690 and one HTC Desire HD A9191, with latest updates applied to each. Android 2.3.6 / GINGERBREAD.XXNA1 on the S5690s Android 2.3.5 / 3.12.405.1 on the A9191. User &quot;DM4N&quot; only reported &quot;HTC Desire HD&quot; and &quot;latest updates&quot;, I don't know if there exist different variants of this model name. My main phone is still running a 2.5 series TextSecure due to this. Wife's on 2.9.3 as of today, she has a newer phone with a 4.something Android...

		Hi, I am using TextSecure on Android (2.10.1). A friend of mine has sent me a video through the Signal app for iOS (via push), but I don't seem to be able to open it. All I can see is a bubble with the video icon (not a preview of the video, just an icon saying it's a video). When I click on it, I am asked if I want to temporarily copy it to the disk etc, I say 'yes', the default video player loads and then closes itself in a couple of seconds, saying that &quot;an error occurred&quot;. This may have something to do with the fact that when my friend sent the video my connection was really bad/absent, though one would expect the application to retry until the attachment has been properly downloaded (but maybe this is not the point). Thank you

		Hello, I have not yet had the chance to use the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer (2f20bb8) myself, since TextSecure 2.10.x still seems to be in beta. But I now saw that you seem to be using the Google Emojis for the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer, or at least I assume that's what you are doing by looking at this: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/tree/master/assets There is an issue with this though. Signal-iOS of course is using the Apple Emojis. And they sometimes look very different from the Google Emojis. You can see a comparison between the Apple Emojis and the Google Emojis over there: http://www.explodedsoda.com/2013/07/ios-to-google-hangout-emoji-comparison.html As you can see, they sometimes look very different. So they can easily get lost in translation. There is an whole article about this issue, which describes the issue quite well, see the following article: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html There are some alternative Emoji sets available though, which look more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set does. And they even are open source. For example: There is the Twitter Emoji set called &quot;Twemoji&quot;, see: https://blog.twitter.com/2014/open-sourcing-twitter-emoji-for-everyone https://github.com/twitter/twemoji The Twemoji set looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set, see the following comparison for example: http://mroth.github.io/emojicompare/ As you can see, the Twemoji set looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set does. And there also is the &quot;Emoji One&quot; Emoji set, see: http://emojione.com/ https://github.com/Ranks/emojione The Emoji One Emoji set also looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set. Here is a big comparison chart where you can compare them (the chart even has the Twemoji set and the Google Emoji set): http://emoji.codes/family As you can see, the Twemoji set and the Emoji One set are both more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set is. So, could you please use the Twemoji or Emoji One Emoji set or something similar in TextSecure-Android instead of using the Google Emoji set, to lessen the risk of them getting lost in translation (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html) when chatting with Signal-iOS users? It would be much appreciated. Regards
	</description>
			<title>The Google Emoji set in TextSecure-Android sometimes differs noticeably from the Apple Emoji set in Signal-iOS and therefore might get lost in translation. Please use a more similar Emoji set, like the &quot;Emoji One&quot; Emoji set or the Twitter &quot;Twemoji&quot; Emoji set for example.</title>

		Hello, I am just submitting this issue just in case you will stay with the Google Emoji set, instead of changing the Emoji set as requested over there: WhisperSystems#2892 I assume the Emoji set used for the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer is the Google Emoji set residing over there: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/tree/master/assets The Google Emoji set there is an old version of the Google Emoji set though. The Google Emoji set recently has been updated, for more details see: http://blog.emojipedia.org/android-50-emoji-changelog and: http://blog.emojipedia.org/209-new-emoji-flags-available-today So, in case you should stay with the Google Emoji set, please update it to the latest version.

		System language: English (US), TextSecure language: Japanese (or any translated language) Go to a conversation Tap identity verification from the lock icon Choose to scan a code After Barcode Scanner has opened, go back (don't have to scan anything) Note that the title of this view has changed to English (also the overlay text from Barcode Scanner is in English &quot;No scanned key found&quot;) Go back to conversation view All the menus are in English and also the text box tl;dr: just watch this .gif: If the system language is set to non-English there is no issue. Also Barcode Scanner's QR code view does not cause this – only the camera. Tested with: Android 5.0.1 and 4.0.4; TextSecure 2.10.1 (first time I run into this was in 2.6 or earlier)

		When sending a message fails, the current behaviour is that you get a notification about the failure. I think it would be better to also display something like a red triangle in the conversations list, mostly because: -you may swipe the notification without taking care of resending the message right away -several messages may fail to send if you temporarily lose your connection, and clicking every notification seems cumbersome to me -it would just make sense for the sake of clarity And maybe move the failed messages to the top of the conversations list (?) Thank you

		Hello, the blue toolbar at the top of every screen in TextSecure casts a shadow. I realize that this probably comes from material design. But the shadow in TextSecure is quite strong up to a point where it is distracting, especially when it is covering messages. I had a look at some other material design apps. Maybe there might be some material design apps which have a shadow as strong as TextSecure does, but the ones that I had a look at all had a much more subtle shadow to their toolbar. And some material design apps I had a look at did not even have a shadow for their toolbar. And I just noticed that even the TextSecure dark theme does not seem to have a shadow for it's toolbar. So, could you please reduce the shadow of the toolbar in the TextSecure light theme to make it more subtle? It would be much appreciated. Regards

		In my mind the &quot;Verify identity&quot; screen as it is right now (showing two fingerprints) is not compliant with the second Development Ideology. The user doesn't know what a key is. I propose the following solution which is much easier to understand for a user while providing the same amount of security: Show the QR code that is being displayed when clicking &quot;Get my key scanned&quot; instead of the fingerprints Add a &quot;Scan their identity&quot; button that opens &quot;Scan their key to compare&quot; For me it would also be acceptable to have an advanced mode which shows the fingerprints but that doesn't really comply with the third Development Ideology. PS: I'd also appreciate having an indication showing if I have already verified the identity of the person I'm chatting with. Maybe by showing the action bar in the chat activity in orange if not verified?

		Though I think it is a neat feature, it should be optional at least :) Sending the same image in a single conversation leads to a 1280 px resize with 222 KB, while as group attachment you blow out the whole 3,6 MB at the original resolution. Noticed while wondered about the massive memory usage for some received images. Image 3 was received in a group 2.10.1 on 4.4.4 and 5.0.2

		For some reason I don't know, textsecure is extremely slow at sending messages when on wifi. On 3g it works fine (it's not as fast as other apps I've tried, but it's acceptable), but the situation on wifi is &quot;concerning&quot;. When I send messages (especially if I send many, one after the other), it looks like it takes a while (several seconds) for textsecure to start sending the data, like I wasn't connected to the internet, but I am. In the notification bar, I don't see the upload/download arrows highlighted, it's like it's not even trying to connect. Sometimes it takes less time to turn on and back off airplane mode to fix the issue than to wait until it starts sending the data. The wifi works perfectly fine, by the way. Thank you

		Hard to reproduce, but seems to happen most of the time, when I was on the Main Screen or in another Conversation and Screen Saver switched on. If I get a notification and use the Andoird Acticity indicator to read the new message, the TextSecure Conversation is empty at first (white) and can only be accessed upon clicking on the screen or going back to the main menu. Running on Cm 11 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1c6de393931e4bb41ee9

		I'm asking this here since the forum (http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/topics/629248-general-questions/questions) seems pretty much dead. When will you start merging textsecure and redphone into signal? Which feature do you plan to add to textsecure before you start? Is the merge already happening on some other repository? Thank you

		I have text secure running on 2 android phones. One phone I use for work (MMB Gingerbread 2.3.7) the other is for private use (CM11). Both phones have a SIM card that uses the same number (in Germany called Dual-SIM). I migrated the text-secure setup from private phone via Titanium backup to the work phone. There was no new key-generation process on the work phone required. Btw. the work phones firmware is also missing the google-services so a reauthorisation is not possible at all. When I talk about messaging this means transport via Internet. Steps to reproduce: Start conversation on my private phone. Outgoing messages from my private and my work phone always receipt successful. Incoming encrypted messages on my private phone are fine Incoming encrypted messages on my work phone are always corrupted (Bad encrypted message).

			<description>
		Hello, the Emoji drawer in TextSecure currently is using the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emoji set. A lot of Android phones do not have the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emoji set as their native system Emoji set though. Samsung uses their own Emoji set, LG uses their own Emoji set, HTC uses their own Emoji set and so on... You can see some of those Emoji sets over there: http://emoji.codes/family Unfortunately though, TextSecure does not replace the native system Emojis with the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis, when the native system Emojis are not the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis, like on Samsung, LG and HTC devices for example. So, when Samsung/LG/HTC users tap on one of the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis in the TextSecure Emoji drawer, a Samsung/LG/HTC Emoji appears in the message input box and in the messages themselves, and not the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis the user actually selected. So, could you please replace/overwrite the Emojis in the message input box and in the messages (and everywhere else where it is possible) with the Emojis that are being used in the Emoji drawer? Telegram for Android also has a built-in Emoji drawer and also has built-in Emojis. And Telegram for Android does replace/overwrite the Emojis in the message input box and in the messages (and everywhere else where it is possible) with the Emojis that are being used in the Emoji drawer. So it is possible to do it. Could you please fix this and do it like Telegram for Android is doing it? Regards

		Hello, the size of the Emojis in the TextSecure Emoji drawer scales with the system font size. So, if the system font size gets increased, the size of the Emojis in the TextSecure Emoji drawer also increases and vice versa. First of all I am asking me: Is that an intentional behaviour? Or is it a bug? Second: The size of the Emojis in the Emoji drawer actually is noticeably bigger than the height of the system font size. Or with other words: They do not match. If the the Emoji size scaling with the system font size is intentional, then shouldn't the size of the Emojis match the height of the system font size? Regards

		Hello, the Emoji drawer / keyboard toggle icon: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_grey600_24dp.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_white_24dp.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_keyboard_grey600_24dp.png is (or are) smaller than the Emoji category icons in the Emoji drawer. It looks inconsistent. Also, the Emoji toggle icon (the smiley): https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_grey600_24dp.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_white_24dp.png is a different smiley than the smiley icon which is being used for the Emoji people category icon in the Emoji drawer (the smiley between the clock and the flower). That also looks inconsistent. In Telegram for Android, the Emoji drawer / keyboard toggle icon has the same size as the Emoji category icons in the Emoji drawer. And the Emoji drawer toggle icon in Telegram for Android uses the same smiley that is being used for the Emoji people category icon in the Emoji drawer (the smiley between the clock and the flower). Which looks and feels more consistent. So, could you please increase the size of the Emoji drawer / keyboard toggle icon in TextSecure, to make it match the size of the Emoji category icons in the Emoji drawer? And could you please replace the Emoji drawer toggle smiley with the same smiley that is being used for the Emoji people category icon in the Emoji drawer (the smiley between the clock and the flower)? Regards

		Hello, when toggling between the keyboard and the TextSecure Emoji drawer, the TextSecure Emoji drawer appears above the keyboard for a brief momen and &quot;fades&quot; into the keyboard, which looks like a glitch and is uneasy on the eyes. In Telegram for Android, that does not happen. In Telegram for Android, when toggling between the built-in Emoji drawer and the keyboard, the toggle happens instantly, the Emoji drawer instantly replaces the keyboard, without any transition or whatever, which looks much smoother. In TextSecure it currently looks buggy and is quite uneasy on the eyes. Could you please fix it? Regards

		hi, I installed TS some days ago. I could send and receive encrypted messages and also received SMS. Today several SMS did not appear on my phone. From another phone I send a test SMS and got a receive receipt there but still no SMS on my phone. Then I disabled SMS in TS and tried again. This time the SMS was shown (I the native message app). Knut Device info: Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100g), CyanogenMod 10.1.3, TextSecure 2.9.3 App state: Push registered, SMS/MSS enabled

		Hello, the Emoji drawer in TextSecure is wasting space on the left and right side. As you can see on the following screenshot for example: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5326916/7094948/5b3b4470-dfc6-11e4-82a7-206899989f75.png (Source) there is a lot of empty space on both the left as well as on the right side. Also the vertical scrollbar is not placed directly on the outside of the Emoji drawer. There is a lot of empty space between the right outside and the scrollbar. Even when I reduce the system font size to minimum, which makes the Emojis smaller, I only get up to seven Emojis in one row on a display with 1080 pixels in width. In comparison: Telegram for Android does not waste as much space on the left and right side of it's Emoji drawer and has the vertical scrollbar placed almost directly on the right side without having so much empty space between it and the right outside. And in Telegram for Android I get eight Emojis in one row. Could you please shift the vertical scrollbar more to the right and use the empty space on the left and right side for actual content (i.e. Emojis), so that the space is not being wasted? It would be much appreciated. Regards

		Hello, the TextSecure Emoji drawer renders outside of the visible screen area in certain circumstances. Unfortunately I couldn't make a screenshot of it because I saw it happen on someone else's device. It was a HTC Desire (Bravo) with an 3.7 inch 480×800 pixel screen running TextSecure 2.10.2 on an unofficial 4.4.4 KitKat based CyanogenMod 11.0 ROM with system font size set to maximum. When the Emoji drawer was set to the recent (clock icon) category or to the people (smiley icon) category, then everything seemed to be fine. But when the Emoji drawer was set to another category, like the nature (flower icon) category for example, then the Emoji drawer was growing a bit towards the left side of the screen, essentially making it render outside of the visible screen area (it became wider than the actual screen width). On a LG G2 with stock 4.4.2 KitKat ROM, this does not happen. So maybe it's related to the low screen resolution of the HTC Desire (Bravo). Again, I couldn't take a screenshot, but maybe you can reproduce it in an emulator or something like that when setting the screen resolution to 480x800 and setting system font size to maximum. Could you please fix it? Regards

		Hi, I've always wondered why this is, but just figured it may be some sort of bug. Like 80% of the time, the messages I send get the delivery receipt symbol (the check mark) &quot;way&quot; before they turn blue (meaning they have been sent). Basically I send a message, it is shown as pending, it gets the delivery check mark, and then it is shown as sent. And this happens all the time, way more than just half the time. I thought messages turned blue after they'd reached the server, and got the check mark once they'd been delivered. But how is it possible that going from my phone to the recipient's phone and back takes less than going from my phone to the server and back? Sometimes I get the delivery receipt several seconds before the message is marked as sent. Is this some problem with the server being slower at some tasks than others, or is it some problem with the client? Thank you

		Hello, the recent category in TextSecure for Android is reversed. Recently used Emojis are being added to the bottom right (the end) of the list. This is counter intuitive and seems illogical, since you need to scroll down to the bottom of the list to pick a recent Emoji. Every other keyboard or built-in Emoji drawer I know does it the other way around. Other keyboards and built-in Emoji drawers add recent Emojis to the top left (the beginning) of the list. So, could you please fix it in the TextSecure Emoji drawer? Regards

		Hey guys :) I noticed a bug where the image preview in 'all images' is not the right one. (Nexus 4, Android 5.1, TS 2.11.1) How to reproduce: Open a chat with many pictures in it and click on 'all images' (in the chat where I noticed the bug are about 150 pics I guess) Scroll down to the bottom of all the images Click on any image The preview is different than the actual picture you open If I wait a few seconds and click on the preview and go back and scroll a bit and click on it again it's the right one but not on the first/second click... This issue may be related to #840. You can find the log here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bbb8be8f2e0fb06821f3

		Hi everyone, after receiving an image, Textsecure crashes directly after the start. In airplane mode, Textsecure works as aspected and shows all messages (including the last one containing the image). As soon as I'm on-line again, Textsecure crashes again. I'm using Android 4.0.4 on a HUAWEI U8825-1. The Log shows: W/JobConsumer( 2335): java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -20 W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.MasterCipher.verifyMacBody(Unknown Source) W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.MasterCipher.decryptBytes(Unknown Source) W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.AttachmentDownloadJob.createAttachmentPointer(Unknown Source) W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.AttachmentDownloadJob.retrievePart(Unknown Source) W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.AttachmentDownloadJob.onRun(Unknown Source) W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.MasterSecretJob.onRun(Unknown Source) W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.runJob(Unknown Source) W/JobConsumer( 2335): at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.run(Unknown Source) W/dalvikvm( 2335): threadid=12: thread exiting with uncaught exception (group=0x40cbd2d0) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): FATAL EXCEPTION: JobConsumer-0 E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -20 E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.MasterCipher.verifyMacBody(Unknown Source) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.MasterCipher.decryptBytes(Unknown Source) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.AttachmentDownloadJob.createAttachmentPointer(Unknown Source) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.AttachmentDownloadJob.retrievePart(Unknown Source) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.AttachmentDownloadJob.onRun(Unknown Source) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.MasterSecretJob.onRun(Unknown Source) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.runJob(Unknown Source) E/AndroidRuntime( 2335): at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.run(Unknown Source) You can find a full log here: http://pastebin.com/99fEDce3 Thank you, mju0

		Hi TextSecure volunteers, thanks for your work. since moving to an IP-based protocol I have wished I could leave my phone number entirely behind and use an alternative identity uid/token for myself. phone numbers themselves are a private token that users may wish to not reveal. is this something that is being considered? it would be fine if TextSecure refused to handle conventional sms/mms in this configuration.

		Go to your conversation list Search for some subset of your conversations Tap and hold to select at least one of the conversations from the search results Now tap 'select all' from the top right corner TS will select all of your conversations instead of just all the search results (6. If you want to live dangerously try to delete the selected messages by tapping the trash bin. It will remove all conversations. This proves that it really selects all conversations and not just misrepresent the number of selected messages.) A .gif demonstration (does not strictly follow the above steps): TS 2.11.1, Android 5.0.1 and also 4.0.4

		Prior versions appeared to allow encrypted smses that were sent without using the internet... once the public keys had been obtained online. This feature is much needed as certain country areas don't have reliable mobile internet or users may have the internet turned off (to save battery life even) and it's a real pain to get messages from other TextSecure users hours or days late once the internet is available again. Please bring back this feature.

		Hello I created a group in TextSecure and the group worked well for over week. My Textsecure then crashed and I had to clear data and clear cache and re-register to get Textsecure to work again. Now I get Unnamed Group instead of the old group name where group messages come I get messages from the other group members but cannot reply to them or post pictures, video etc to the group. If I recreate the Group name and add the people to it they get a totally new group called Unnamed Group which we can all post to but that is unpleasing to all! This is really frustrating Has Text secure assigned a new administrator for the group? If so who and how do I get back on? It was me that convinced the whole group to leave WhatsApp for a more secure app!

		Hope this is not a dup. On the last couple of text secure updates (on the Droid Turbo at least). The emoticons are very messed up. Best description I can give is that if I had a tic-tac-toe grid of emoticons, The new text secure app is centering on the intersections of the grid. So for each emoticon, I see a quarter of each emoticon around the grid intersection.

		I sent a messge in an existing conversation, and it was not sent with a warning that the contact's fingerprint had changed. The option i was given was to 'verify identity', at which point the message was sent. While in the warning state, i couldn't find a way to either view the new fingerprint of the contact so that I could confirm it out of band, or prevent the pending message from being sent when I verified identity in order to see the new fingerprint.

		This is my post in another (closed) issue thread ... I'm experiencing the same issue as Matej described here after updating TexTesecure (from 2 versions back) without changing MMS settings in any way. I've tried with Andorid defaults (TextSecure defaults) and manual settings ... No luck! Sending MMS works fine both way. I've discovered something interesting. When I get MMS notification message, expiration time (for downloading MMS content) displayed in TextSecure is identical to time, when notification was received. What means that it's a priori expired! Downloading MMS content on default Android app works fine too. ... And MatejKovacic previously wrote: &quot;I have TextSecure 2.11.1 (the latest version) on HTC One Mini. I have received MMS in TextSecure, but cannot open it. TextSecure is connecting to MMS server, but after a while it times out. I am using Simobil (MCC: 293, MNC: 40). My settings are: URL MMSC: http://mmc Proxy server for MMS: 80.95.224.46 Proxy server port for MMS: 9201 MMSC username: simobil MMSC password: internet MMS proxy: (without) Any idea?&quot; Original post (in inappropriate and closed issue thread): WhisperSystems#388

		Since version 2.10.x, the emojis key (in the left of the input field) is always present even if the device has a emoji capable keyboard like the Google keyboard. On my nexus 4 (android 5.1 gogole keyboard), after the 2.10.x update I have this left emoji key which is less convenient than the keyboard emoji key. Plus the keyboard emoji key save the most used emojis for all applications. The emoji drawer integrated in TextSecure only save the most used for TextSecure, I think it's not really convenient. This issue seems to be related to 2f20bb8 Dear developers, can you please use the emojis capable keyboard if it's available or add an option to use the TextSecure emoji drawer or not use ? Thanks for reading this.

		There are some images that I just can't get to send over TextSecure push. No matter whether on WiFi, no matter whether I hit retry or create a new message with the same image, it's always &quot;Failed to send&quot;. Here is the log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f74e7b419ecd8f692935 Strangely, other images work fine. Are the images that I want to send to large or something like that? Is there a size limit on images over PUSH? If yes, it would be helpful to say that in the error message and even offer to send a compressed version.

		I have a friend who notified me after sending a text that her number changed. Nothing seemed different except her old number still shows and text came in automatically decrypted as usual. Shouldn't the app have noticed this? Does the app just go by the keys stored? I deleted the thread and text still come in the same. I even ended the session. Will we both have to delete the app and start over? Seems like a security flaw. When she calls her new number shows up.

		First of all, I apologize if this is a duplicate of #981. I would like the developers to work on making TS a real instant messenger. Right now, even assuming everything goes well when sending a message, it still takes way (way!) more than other popular messengers. I don't know if it's because of the encryption or because of what mentioned in 981, or something else. What I know is that from the second I hit send, it takes some time before the message appears in the conversation, then some time to get sent and some time to get delivered (though usually the last two are inverted). It takes too long. Now, &quot;some time&quot; isn't a minute, but the process of sending is not at all instantaneous. I am basically begging my friends to use textsecure, but they keep complaining because &quot;no way, it's too slow&quot;. To which I don't know what to answer. It does feel much slower than whatsapp. Is this because you don't have enough servers? Or is it a problem of the client itself?

		Phone details: HTC One m8 running CM 12 nightly 4/10/2015. TextSecure 2.11.1 Debug Log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f7429f23e8760d6ffdb6 I was added to an encrypted group chat with other TextSecure users, but I cannot open the keyboard. I am using the standard CM12 keyboard. If I press the emoji key, I can add emojis, but I can't send the message. From the emoji keyboard, I can switch and open the normal Latin keyboard, but if I press any letter, the characters do not appear in the text area. I can receive messages in the group chat. I can also type fine in one-on-one SMS or TextSecure messages. I tried to pull a video off the phone, but TextSecure just shows up as a black screen under adb screenrecord.

		When I'm chatting with someone and I see something I want to take a picture of and send it to them, I have to close TextSecure, take the photo and share it on TextSecure again. That's more work than it needed to be, and furthermore the photo is stored unencrypted first. There should be an option to take the image directly and send it. Threema has such an option, that's the only thing that's better about Threema.

		encountered this while running an unmodified debug build of 27a5b7d sequence of events were: send a bunch of text messages send a bunch of media messages do the same while screwing around with airplane mode attach image image preview is an error icon (may have been ic_action_warning_red or ic_missing_thumbnail_picture, can't remember) click on error image preview crash I then tried to reproduce by simply returning to the convo and reattaching the same image, crash again. Did this a few more times and once the image preview was entirely blank (but still took up the space it should), clicked on that too, crash. While in this crashable state I attempted to reproduce this using a different attachment, no crash. Thinking it may have had something to do with cache I tried another different image that definitely should not have been in cache, also no crash. Eventually through some multi-step process I can't recall I was able to stop the error image from showing up for that one attachment and thus stop the crashing. debug log &gt;&gt; https://gist.github.com/anonymous/266cafd4ee10f5f3e380 crash E/AndroidRuntime(14933): FATAL EXCEPTION: main

		Hello, it would be really nice if it was possible to swipe left/right in conversations to reach the next/previous conversation in the list. It would be like having a tab-like system, similar to (but not the same as) what surespot does. For example, if I opened the second conversation in the list, swiping right would take me to the first one and swiping left would take me to the third one. This would make it easier to text 2+ people at the same time. Of course it's not a priority, just a thought.

		This came up in #3046 briefly. Sometimes when you delete a picture it will leave around ghost thumbnails that are visible in the system gallery and also in TS attachment gallery. This can lead to the following issue if you try to send the deleted image: Delete a picture that's on your device with shell or a file manager (or create a ghost thumbnail in some other way) Attach that picture to a TS message using the attachment gallery's Recent tab (the gallery does not know that the picture was deleted) You will get a missing thumbnail icon Tap send TS will create an &quot;empty&quot; message that gets stuck in a pending state for eternity If you try to do the same in Google Hangouts you will get a 'Can't find picture' notification and you cannot send the image. TextSecure should also check if the file exists and not trust the gallery viewer. .gif demonstration: TS 2.12.0, stock Android 5.1 and Android 4.0.4

		I just tried to export my keys and sms to an encrypted folder as described on the respective support page: To make a backup of your keys, settings, and messages you can go to the main conversation view and tap the TextSecure logo in the top-left of the screen. Tap the &quot;Import / Export&quot; option, choose the Export tab, and tap &quot;Export Encrypted Backup.&quot; The Export Encrypted Backup option is missing in Textsecure 2.12.0 on Android 4.4.2 though. Has the key export feature been removed from textsecure altogether? What options do I have to export my keys, i.e. when migrating to another phone?

I'm a bit confused as to whether this should be fixed in 2.12 or 2.13, so if it's fixed in 2.13, I'll be happy to close (and reopen if the issue persists). Can I test 2.13 without joining Google+?

			<description>
		I have read some closed/locked issues on this matter already, but I just want to add an extra push. There was argument that TextSecure is to be a secure messaging facility, and fallback to insecure communication is unacceptable. I want to argue that this position is unreasonable, and undermines the effort to get the general public onto secure platforms. The general public has practically zero concern about this; but I do. If text secure refuses to fallback to SMS, then nobody I want to communicate will install the app. The inconvenience of not being able to communicate when out of 3G range (I'm in Australia, we barely have internet in this country), or have exhausted your monthly data allowance (again, I'm in Australia), is more than anyone should have to tolerate. There is only one reasonable solution to this as I see it: TextSecure should attempt to send a message securely. If it can't, a popup informs the user it failed to send, and the user has an option to retry later, or send insecurely (via SMS) immediately. There should also be a &quot;remember my choice&quot; checkbox, and an option in the settings. I have people refusing to install, and uninstalling the app. TextSecure is the only decent, otherwise user-friendly, secure messaging app I have managed to find. All others are borked in various critical ways. Please consider the importance of this app actually being used by an exponential explosion of users; 99% of whom don't give a damn whether it's secure, but must be convinced to use it by the 1% of people who do.

		I am building master and thumbnail orientation is different if I click on it (might be introduced with Glide). Steps to reproduce: Take a picture with Camera Go to Gallery and rotate the image (left or right) in the menu Send image with TextSecure (thumbnail orientation is wrong, like before rotation) Click on the image (image orientation is right in gallery/fullscreen view, like you rotated it) It looks like it has something to do with Exif rotation?! Steps cannot be reproduced with 2.12.0 tag, only with master!

		I would like to help make TextSecure better. This is my first attempt at filing a debug log. As mentioned in the title, I find that TS push messages reach me after a considerable delay and only when the app is back in focus, as in, when TS is in the foreground. If I have to switch apps, messages to me aren't delivered but the moment I open TS and select the particular contact, the pending messages come streaming in. I'm using TextSecure 2.12.0 on a Moto G running CM 12.1 with the Pico variation of GAPPS. I can provide additional info as required. Debug log from my phone : https://gist.github.com/6b3a93e8d7be140f96e6 Debug log from a friend's phone https://gist.github.com/050506894c5fd2ca379d

		Versions Android: 5.0.2 (CM 12-20150414-NIGHTLY-bacon) Device: A0001 TextSecure: 2.12.0 Description I noticed that some Emojis on the keyboard are different than the one send. For example the attached image: the mouth of the devil was flipped and the other one changed his eyes. But there are some more. Is there a chance that the emoji-set will be updated to show the same version in the message and the keyboard-preview?

		Hello, I just installed latest TextSecure and if I knew what it does, I would backup the APK file. Unfortunately, I didn't and the change involving the removal of SMS encryption feature was not mentioned in the changelog, so I unwillingly removed a feature from my phone that I really care about. Is there a way to restore the SMS encryption, either by installing an older APK or by changing that using some hidden option? I evaluated the risks and while being a security conscious man, I would prefer to use outdated software in this case than no encryption at all - encryption using the internet is unfortunately out of option for me. I really hope that somebody could help me, otherwise I would have to compile textsecure myself, which doesn't seem trivial. I am willing to donate to the project if this feature can be restored on my phone. Jacek

		We live in times where even the fact that somebody's using encryption raises suspicions. In my eyes a first suspicious sign would be a telephone number which is stored in a database of a messenger like TextSecure. Gathering those is a low hanging fruit because we all know that the structure of telephone numbers is very deterministic and entropy of those is additionally reduced by TextSecure. Another reason is that some people just don't like that everyone who has ones telephone number knows that TextSecure is used. I suggest to give more control over that. The easiest solution I can imagine is that there's a &quot;cloak&quot; mode: Alice uses TextSecure. However, she doesn't want that Mallory knows that Alice is using that App so Alice activates the cloak mode. In this mode, every time Mallory searches for intersections on the server Alices token is ignored. To get in touch with a cloaked user, I suggest the following approach: Bob wants to contact Alice. Alice is still in cloaking mode. Bob can select Alice from his phone contacts for a contact request. Alice receives this request. If she acknowledges, Bob get notified that Alice is available. If Alice ignores the request, nothing happens. Other, less convenient solutions I thought of: It's not possible that Mallory can see Alice in the intersection request if Alice doesn't have Mallory in her contact list. (Here the server whould have to know and store contact link information which is bad.) There's a kind of challenge-response technique via another channel than TextSecure which allows Bob to add Alice to the contacts. (More complicated and requires a second channel) What do you think? Greetings, Noir

		Hey, my girlfriend and I have been using TextSecure for ages now. Somehow, with her HTC One M8 she can't send me messages when our phones are in our WLAN at home - her messages instantly get a red exclamation mark. Mine work and she receives them perfectly. When the WiFi on her phone is turned off, it continues to work again. Anyone ever experienced this before?

		If you leave a group the thread is not deleted but you lose the ability to type in the input box and send messages. [1] I assume this is the expected behavior as you might still want to view past messages after leaving. However if everyone else leaves the group you can still do everything: type text, add attachments and send messages. This makes no sense since there are no recipients anymore. The thread should be &quot;locked&quot; as in the case above where you are the one who leaves. Adding more people (updating group) should &quot;unlock&quot; the conversation again. There are many issues about groups but could not find anything about this case. TS 2.12.0, stock Android 5.1 Edit: Here's a debug log after the following steps: Open TS first time after boot Go to a group All the other people leave the group (in this debug log all the other people = one person) I send a message to the empty group ([1] You can still type using the TS emoji drawer. Also you can add attachments. But it might be best to add this as a separate issue.)

		method source given the above fuzzy filter &quot;%&quot; + filter + &quot;%&quot; you would expect that for the string Axolotl the following filters would match: [Axo, olo, otl]. however, on certain phones only the first (Axo) matches. incomplete list of affected devices confirmed via TestObject: EDIT: I think the root of this problem is actually in ContactsDatabase.queryAndroidDb(), not ContactsDatabase.queryLocalDb(). Give the string Axolotl and the filters [Axo, olo, otl], the following devices will only match on (Axo) when expected to match on all 3. Motorola DROID X2, Samsung I9070, HTC One SV, Fairphone, Wiko Rainbow, HTC One S.

		Currently the icons of all contacts look the same: a gray smiley face (unless a profile picture has been set up in the contacts app I assume—I don't actually have any so I'm not sure). It would be nice if instead the icon was a circle with the initial(s) of the person being messaged, as seen in the contacts app itself, as well as other sms clients. Perhaps this feature is already planned, since Signal on iOS uses it.

		With the last update, the emoji drawer changes the order of emojis in the recently used every time you use one. So it is kind of difficult to use the same emoji twice (you can't just tap twice as the emoji moves after the first tap). It would be more intuitive if the order was updated after the drawer is closed and reopened, and not &quot;live&quot; as it's being done now. Did I explain it well?

Here's some information about date formats in various regions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country TS 2.13.0 This issue does not depend on whether you have changed the system language or TS language.

		My TS crashes everytime when i send or recieve an uncrypted SMS. Then it keeps crashing when I enter my password. Same behaviour when I delete all data from the app (via settings) and start over with a &quot;clean&quot; app. So it seems it has nothing to do with previous messages. The only solution to open TS again without crashing is to restore a Titanium Backup. System: Oneplus One (bacon) with Cyanogenmod 12.1-20150505-nightly (Android 5.1.1). The Bug also affeced the previous 3 nighlies.

		I don't get notifications for received messages until i open TS. (no sound, no vibrating, no LED, ...) No matter if: TS is locked/unlocked display is on/off message received in a group or not I only use push messages. I have a Sony Xperia Z1C with Android 5.0.2. I think this issue appeared for the first time after i upgraded from KitKat to Lollipop. (but I'm not absolutly sure) I have two friends with the same problem. Both have Android 5. (one of them has a Sony Xperia Z2 and the other has a Nexus)

		This is such a minor issue that it feels almost a sin reporting this but sometimes details are important. Currently the default led notification color is green. However the only green left in TextSecure are the message bubbles when using unencrypted SMS. Otherwise TextSecure is all about blue now (icon, UI, push messages). Therefore the default led color should follow suit.

		When typing a message longer than a single line, TextSecure allows the user to scroll the input box left and right in order to see the whole input. It would be nice if instead of this scrolling function the box simply gained another line as the length of the message increased. This would allow the user to always see the entire message without scrolling. While this would take up slightly more vertical space, this would be especially useful when reviewing the message before sending (say, to make sure nothing was autocorrected incorrectly). Plus, TextSecure already increases the input area, though only to show the number of characters when they go past the 160 character mark. Thanks.

			<description>
		You know the little pulsing bar that appears when writing something in a text box? (I'm sure i thas a name but I can't think of a better description right now). Since 2.14.1 (probably 2.14) it has disappeared from textsecure. This obviously makes it hard and uncomfortable to write messages.. I like textsecure, and I appreciate the effort you're putting into it, really. But do you even test the app before releasing updates? Missing commas that screw the phones and make us lose messages, huge usability problems that would've taken 10 seconds to notice... I mean... of course it's human to forget a comma or introduce bugs, we all know it. The problem is that testing should be considered fundamental, even when you have beta testers. Beta testers are supposed to find smaller problems, not sacrifice their product for the sake of bugs. That's what the developers should be doing. Apologies if it sounds rude, and thanks again.

		When you scroll in a certain way in the 'All images' gallery picture thumbnails at the top and bottom boundaries disappear. Possibly related #2985 I have only encountered this today so I guess this has been introduced fairly recently (Glide issue)? Open 'All images' from a conversation that has so many of your precious photos that you need to scroll to see them all Scroll down and pull up before new images are fully visible (do this move gently, don't jerk like a machine) Continue scrolling down to expose new precious photos Alternate between steps 2 and 3 as long as you wish (or until your lifespan expires) When you do this the two leftmost boundary thumbnails will disappear like tears in the rain .gif demonstration: TS 2.14.1, stock andy 5.1, Nexus-4 model (with artificial snake scale back skin of finest quality) Debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2a14febcb19e54f344ca Also happens with my old 4.0.4 skin-job model (which should be retired already).

		I have noticed that the sent time is after the received time within the details of a message. Are these values swapped (which would be an easy fix) or is something more complicated going on? This seems related to #2314 which requests a display of the sent time.

		This is something I encountered while trying to reproduce #3134 of which I cut 'n' pasted my comments here because the issue appears to be separate. Sometimes when I open a conversation the cursor is missing. This happens on average 5% of the time. The cursor comes back when you tap the input box though. I speculate this issue was introduced in 2.14(.1) but I'm not sure if I would have noticed anything without #3134. Here are some tests I ran while trying to pin it down: for each conversation in the main conversation list repeat (30, 50 or 100 times) open the conversation count if cursor shows or not tap Android's back button to go back to main conversation list Nexus 4, Android 5.1, TS 2.14.1 1st priv. conv. 1: 0/50 (ok after 50 tries nothing, i give up)
2nd priv. conv. 2: 3/30
3rd priv. conv. 3: 5/30
4th priv. conv. 4: 2/30
1st group conv. 1: 1/30
5th priv. conv. 5: 2/30
6th priv. conv. 6: 0/50
 Result: in 13/250 cases I got a missing cursor. The conversations that got 0% do not really differ from the others. Huawei U8880, Android 4.0.4, TS 2.14.1 1st priv. conv. 1: 0/100
 Does not seem to happen on 4.0.4. But I had just one conversation. Here's a debug log from Lollipop after: rebooting phone opening TS switching between the conversation list and a specific conversation until the cursor disappeared (took 16 tries) I realize this is a &quot;new version of TextSecure makes my phone run 0.4 Fahrenheit colder than before and it's affecting my testicle balance when I keep my phone in my pocket&quot; type of an issue but I'm doing this mostly for documentation. Maybe this has some relevance to another more important case in the future. I think I'm gonna unsub myself as soon as I hit that Submit button.

		I'd like to request a new &quot;feature&quot;, which would be some kind of indicator when a new day begins (like it's implemented in other messengers like WhatsApp). I think this would make searching messages that were sent on a certain day easier and it just structures the conversations... Below you can see how WhatsApp handles it and I think a similar solution would be great! 👍 2

			<description>
		In a group message (at least unsecured, not sure if true in secure chats), the &quot;Group members&quot; view shows a list of contacts and unknown numbers involved in the message. Each entry is clickable, and closes the view. I would think the expected behavior on unknown numbers should be to add a number to contacts, similar to tapping their avatar in a message. Assuming that person ever actually participates in the thread, it's a somewhat moot point, as you'll be able to tap the avatar, but I've had situations where a group member doesn't participate, so the shortcut of adding a contact isn't available. For existing contacts, I would think opening their contact information would be a good default, which would be consistent with using the same behavior as clicking their avatars in the conversation view.

		I just sideloaded TextSecure's APK and it seems to be working on my Nexus 7 (2013/Razor) with WiFi only. I confirmed with another number that I own (probably even IPKall would work) since there's no SMS/MMS capabilities. I didn't run into any of the issues mentioned in #614. If nobody has any objections, why not remove the no tablets limitation on Google Play? Maybe @moxie0 or whoever controls the Play Store app could chime in?

		I've been using the group functionality recently, and I've found that if, when I sync (I use battery stamina mode, apps will not sync while phone is locked), I get a stream of notifications. My vibration motor gets a real workout. If there are 30 notifications, I get 30 vibrate/sound events in very rapid succession. Running android 4.4.2. Please let me know what other information would be useful :) 👍 10

		I received an SMS from my boss earlier (he's an iPhone user, using the default iOS SMS client) and, for some reason, TextSecure opened from the notification but crashed afterwards, hanging on a black screen after entering my passphrase and prompting Android to ask me if I wanted to Report/Wait/Close. I hit the app switcher button and dismissed TextSecure and tried the notification again but just got the black screen, so told Android to report the crash. I dismissed TextSecure via the app switcher again and opened TextSecure from the app shortcut and it let me in ok, but the text message now reads, in italics: Received a message encrypted using an old version of TextSecure that is no longer supported. Please ask the sender to upgrade to the most recent version and resend the message. except, as I mentioned, my boss isn't using TextSecure; he's using the default iOS SMS client. After whining about it on Twitter, @WhisperSystems replied asking me to open an issue with a debug log. So here I am, with a debug log at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9111ffde3f88317b203b 😎

			<description>
		Hi everyone, after a good time using TextSecure I am starting to experience a really crippling bug that has many different outcomes: I am missing a certain number of messages (were sent to me but never received); Those I do receive are hardly ever pushed with a notification. I have to open TextSecure for them to show up, and they appear to have been sent right that minute; Tens of messages mark &quot;Now&quot; as the time they were sent/received. This is of course wrong, and fucks up the entire chronology (latest received on top); Whenever I try to send a text, it says TextSecure is trying to send a large quantity of messages; A fair amount of messages give me an &quot;unable to send&quot; error message. Any idea what the problem could be? Here's the debug log: https://gist.github.com/90779d7e4406141e3efe Thanks, Régis

		Sometimes I don't receive secure messages until I manually open the app (even if phone was unlocked at time of sending). TextSecure services are running. This happen randomly but 1 times out of ten I would say. I've been trying to make this happen on purpose without success and I have not seen the same issue with regular SMS. (This is really annoying as I can't know if I've received something.) On Android 5.1.1

		Go to main conversation list Tap the pen icon on the lower right to get to the contact list Tap your device's Back button to hide the keyboard that just popped up Some contact avatars do not get rendered at all This affects both picture contacts and initial creation contacts. Scrolling usually fixes the issue or moves it to another contact. It seems that if you dismiss the keyboard (step 3) quickly it increases the likelihood of missing avatars.

		Hello, I think it would be really nice if a textsecure message has not been received it auto-retries using the unsecured SMS (ofcourse, only optional, disabled by defalt). This is useful in many situations like roaming or even when you want to save battery and disable push or mobile networking completely (and someone else tries to reach you). So what I propose is to add an option to notify the user when his textsecure message has not been recieved for X minutes and/or add an option to automatically send the same text via SMS to make sure it reaches the other one – ditching the security for a moment when other things are more important. For &quot;normal&quot; textsecure users this can be a rather frequent annoyance. EDIT: If possible, maybe one should delete the secured TextSecure message if the auto-falback SMS has been sent to avoid double-sending

		I received an SMS from Google Calendar's SMS notification short-code (48368) that TextSecure believes was encrypted with an out of date version of TextSecure. I do not believe that Google uses TextSecure's encryption (correct me if I'm wrong), thus I'm lead to believe that TextSecure is incorrect in it's evaluation that the message was encrypted. I am unable to retrieve the original (&quot;encrypted&quot;) text. TextSecure simply displays the &quot;error&quot; text: Received a message encrypted using an old version of TextSecure that is no longer supported. Please as the sender to upgrade to the most recent version and resend the message. Sent May 15th, 2015 02:10:02 PM EDT. I believe I was up-to-date at that time. My current version of TextSecure is 2.14.5 on Android 5.1. I have since received another message from 48368 which was not evaluated as encrypted and displayed as a normal unencrypted SMS. Is there any further information I can provide to help debug the issue? Is there anyway to get the original (&quot;raw&quot;) SMS message from under that error?

		For some reasons, textsecure on my phone seems to send 16bit encoded SMS. So I can only have 70 characters per SMS instead of 140 in 8bit or 160 in 7bit. Is the character encoding choosed by TextSecure or is it enforced by android system? I suspect 16bit encoding is mandatory for emoji, but in the case if I don't use them, could TextSecure switch to 8bit, or 7bit if I don't even use accents? This could cut by two my SMS budget.

		As far as I know, there's no great way for a list adapter to notify each list item that it needs to be recycled in the event that the activity is being paused/stopped/destroyed. Because of this, there's context leak around our Recipient listener logic. Seems like we should either 1) find a consistent way for RecyclerView/ListView adapters to listen to lifecycle events and report them up to their bound list items, or 2) make all our RecipientListeners only hold a weak reference to the context.

		It has happened sometimes (twice, so far) that even though I'm typing a message in the text box I don't get the arrow icon to send -- the attachment icon never goes away. When I click it, the behaviour is that of adding the attachment (so it's not just a problem of displaying the wrong icon, I am actually asked if I want to take a picture and stuff..). Exiting and re-entering the conversation fixes it. It has happened both when talking to a Signal user and with an SMS one. It seems to be random, I'm trying to figure out how it works but I can't reproduce :/

		I have weird problems with one of my friends. It just won't encrypt my messages anymore even though it worked before (like a couple of weeks before). She says however that the messages are shown in blue to her. But for me they are green and the lock is open. The info says that I am using insecure messages. I tried disabling and reenabling secure messages but that didn't fix the problem. I have TextSecure 2.14.5 and my friend says that she has the latest version also. She tried reinstalling the app but it didn't fix the problem. She says that it still works fine for her other friends. I have no problems with all my other friends.

		I experienced the following today: I have two phones with two separate numbers, both with textsecure installed and push enabled. A friend started a new groupchat and tried to invite me. He only has the option to invite on of my numbers, since my contact only appears once in the list, with one number. The same happens when he tries to start a new 1-to-1 chat. He only has the option to start a conversation with one of my numbers, since the second one ist never shown in the list. He has my two numbers safed in &quot;one&quot; contact. Device: HTC One, stock android Lollipop, Latest TextSecure 2.14.5 App state: Push registered, incoming SMS disabled, outgoing SMS fully disabled

		Many texting apps provide users with the ability to lock messages so that they cannot be deleted. It would be very useful to see this functionality come to the app, because after I imported all of my messages I began to clean them out and noticed that my locked messages were being deleted as well!

		Pictures I send are not displayed by my contact. On my end they are uploaded (dark blue background) and even delivered to their phone (check mark icon), they do not show up on their screen. The same happens in the opposite direction: they claim to have sent me a picture, and say it was sent and delivered, but I did not receive a message, and neither is any image displayed in the thread. Their installation/registration of TS is very new - only about an hour old. We are connected via a very low bandwidth and high latency network. https://gist.github.com/1651dc1d34c9b1a39572

		Hello, this is a follow up to: WhisperSystems#957 Delivery receipts are implemented now. But read receipts are still missing. Could you please add an optional read receipt feature (turned on by default)? Popular messengers like WhatsApp for Android and Telegram for Android do have this feature and it can be quite useful or even quite essential to say the least. Those users who wouldn't like it could simply disable it. Regards

		Some TextSecure emojis are not used in Android notifications. Here's an example message that I received from a strange number. The message contains the AIRPLANE (U+2708) emoji which is displayed differently in notifications and in TS: Lock screen notification: Notification drawer: Heads-up notification: And finally the actual TextSecure message: The meaning of the message changes completely depending on the emoji set used. Now I don't know if I should report this unknown sender to the authorities (like the good, law-abiding citizen I am) or just wish this person a safe trip. I'm not certain if the emojis in the notifications can even be changed but I'm under the impression that WhatsApp does show it's own iOS-like emojis in Android notifications.

		Two dark theme items: The TS message send arrow/airplane is lighter color blue than the the text bubbles. I noted there are other dark theme blue icons so this might be nice to have here. The background of the top bar where the &quot;TextSecure&quot; and the search magnifying glass and options dots are in the list of conversations has no color at all. I think it'd be a nice touch to have a blue background for that bar like the light theme does but using the darker blue.

		When I look at my sms/TS message info for received messages they always have the received time before the sent time. So received time could be 8:01:25 and sent time would be 8:01:30, for example. This is with users of any network and timezone as far as I can tell. Did they happen to get switched accidentally in the code? The difference in time is just a few seconds which would look right to me. Running 2.16.3 on galaxy s4 stock Verizon 5.0.1.

		On the textSecure panel showing the list of threads, each of them has a field showing the time elapsed since the last message. typically I read something like &quot;11 mins&quot;. I wonder what the s after min stands for. Unit for minute is min, and units do not take plural form. Unfortunately I must say that this trend of putting plural mark to units is more and more common in the US, and it appears that it is getting more common in other countries as well. Spreading that nonsense is definitely not good so I suggest that the &quot;plural unit issue&quot; be taken care of as soon as possible. Check also for the hour, I am pretty sure that soon some &quot;hrs&quot; will show up. &quot;h&quot; would actually be the best, while &quot;hr&quot; being also accepted. Thank you

		Since a few days I experience a strange behaviour of TextSecure 2.14.5 on my OnePlus One with Android 5.0. I'm chatting with someone and the messages I send definitely get delivered: I see the checkmark under the message and my dialog partner reacts/answers on what I have written. Then, after some time (half a minute to several minutes) the checkmark disappears, I see a red exclamation mark left of the message and below it reads Nicht zugestellt (German for Not delivered). When I open the message details it offers to re-send the message, but this only removed the error message and does not bring back the checkmark. Do you have any idea what's going wrong here?

		Hello, using TextSecure 2.16.3 on an LG G2 running latest stock ROM (Android 5.0.2 Lollipop), the height of the Emoji drawer does not match the height of the system keyboard. The Emoji drawer is higher than the system keyboard (tested with Google Keyboard from Play Store). Could you please fix that and make the height of the Emoji drawer equal to the height of the system keyboard? Regards

		I first noticed this after the recent update to the Photos app. When sharing from within that app, a toast notification says &quot;Sharing to TextSecure...&quot; and the message composition process continues as expected. When sent, the message disappears. This bug does not happen when the sharing process is started from within TextSecure through either the paperclip icon or the &quot;Add attachment&quot; menu option.

		Hi. I think it's time for TextSecure to join the 21st century by adding one of the most basic features in existence: A blocklist. If some moron starts sending me push messages, or text messages, I should be able to block the person. I don't really care how, if there is a list I have to add people to or if I press their name in the Text list and choose block, but the matter of fact is that this feature is waaaaaaaaay overdue.

		Currently the paperclip in the sending field is a black/white icon. Prior to the paperclip, it was a green or blue airplane indicating transport protocol. Could that be done to the paperclip as well to be in sync with the airplane to be green or blue?

		KK Widget (aka DashClock) has the ability to show text messages on its screen saver but, unfortunately, TextSecure messages don't show. As a result, I no longer can easily see when I receive a text. Would be nice to see these two somehow integrated.

		After last week's update I noticed 'colored first letter of the name&quot; symbols inside a circle next. I guess this feature might help in group chats or maybe it was added after noticing it in telegram. But I would love a toggle for this new feature because its making the dark theme look very ugly and functionally it isn't helpful at all. I guess this is super low priority but do consider adding an option to turn this UI design off.

		Hello, using TextSecure 2.16.4 on an LG G2 running latest stock ROM (Android 5.0.2 Lollipop), the Emojis in messages and in the message input box are not centered and also do not scale with the system font size. Here is a screenshot with system font size set to maximum: Here is a screenshot with system font size set to medium: Here is a screenshot with system font size set to minimum: As you can see, it's more noticeable at larger system font sizes, but still there even at the smallest system font size. As you can see, the Emojis in the messages and in the message input box are shifted towards the bottom (i.e. not centered) and also obviously do not scale with the system font size. Could you please fix that? Regards

		Hello, using TextSecure 2.16.4 on an LG G2 running latest stock ROM (Android 5.0.2 Lollipop), the Emojis are full of jaggies / have a low resolution. It becomes especially noticeable in the Emoji drawer when the system font size is set to a large value, which in turn lets the Emojis become bigger in the Emoji drawer. Here is a screenshot with system font size set to maximum: As you can see, the Emojis show a lot of jaggies and seem to have a low resolution. This can't be an issue with the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emoji set itself, since it is even available in SVG format from source, see: https://code.google.com/p/noto/source/browse/?name=master#git%2Fcolor_emoji%2Fsvg So, could you please fix that? Regards

		Hi. Bear with me here. This could be a problem with Cyanogen, or may be more appropriate for the support form. Feel free to close if either of these are the case. Android 4.2.2/Samsung SGH-T399/TextSecure 2.16.4 Debug log: https://gist.github.com/35c5e8f3086090a31234 I've mysteriously been registered to Cyanogen's whisperpush server for awhile now (I've never installed cyanogenmod on my device), and finally got around to unregistering myself. Previously, while I was registered, my friend who uses cyanogenmod tried to send me multiple encrypted messages, which would silently fail. After unregistering from Cyanogen's servers today, I downloaded TextSecure, and successfully registered with my phone number. However, when my friend with cyanogenmod and I tried sending encrypted messages to each other, we received &quot;bad encrypted message&quot; for each message we sent. He tried disabling encryption on his end (in which case i could only send him sms messages) and re-enabling it, but we still got &quot;bad encrypted message&quot; errors. Maybe some sort of problem with key exchanges failing when I was registered to cyanogen servers?

		MessageNotifier uses MediaPlayer for playing the notification sound for in thread notifications but never calls MediaPlayer.release() as strongly suggested in the MediaPlayer documentation the code should either be updated to call release() in a final block or, my preference, stop interacting with the MediaPlayer directly and let the Ringtone class handle this like so: Ringtone tone = RingtoneManager.getRingtone(context, uri);
tone.setStreamType(AudioManager.STREAM_NOTIFICATION);
tone.play(); Ringtone manages a MediaPlayer instance internally and takes care of release() and all that stuff.

		I am running into a problem trying to send a picture on my 1st Gen Moto X running 4.4.4. I'm using TextSecure 2.16.4 in data mode. I took a photo in potrait mode using both the camera app and the in-app option to take a photo. Both times the message will appear in the text window but fail to send. Here's a log from immediately after the failure https://gist.github.com/anonymous/52824d6ed48b2be2a32f I verified that I could send a different photo (in landscape mode) and captured another debug log here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7f056f9973425195b26c I have tried closing and reopening TextSecure without success. It seems specific to this photo as other photos (both taken on the phone or from other sources) are able to be sent. I'm not sure if it's the subject (as other issues mentioned grass being hard to compress) or the orientation of the photo. This seems similar to #3070 or #3028. Also seems like this might have just recently been fixed in version 2.17. Sorry if this is a duplicate. Picture here

		Those who have used Google's &quot;Messenger&quot; application for Android in its more recent iterations may have noticed a new feature for attachments. Clicking the &quot;paperclip&quot; for Attachments , besides the usual options to attach a file, gives the user the option a number of &quot;Quick, in-app, in-line&quot; media capture options. For instance, choosing Picture (or alternately, Video) allows the user to capture the picture or video right from Messenger (a camera window is opened below the text entry box ) which is then added to the message to form the outgoing MMS. Likewise, if the user chooses the Audio tab there is a &quot;Microphone button&quot; and instructions to &quot;press and hold to record&quot;. Doing so allows the user to speak a message which is then encoded as an audio file and added to the outgoing MMS. From what I can tell, TextSecure lacks these options. While a user can send a picture, video, or audio file that has already been saved elsewhere, I believe it would benefit TextSecure to enable these &quot;Quick Capture&quot; options, both for traditional SMS/MMS and Secure(Data) messaging. Many users find these options alluring (particularly the audio quick capture, which allows the sending of a short audio message that can be played by the recipient at their leisure) and TextSecure supporting these features would mean users who enjoy them currently on other platforms could switch and enjoy better privacy/security without having to lose said features Please let me know if this seems feasible. Thank you.

Basically the screen looks like this: and tapping on the text field or the 'submit' button does not cause the keyboard to come up. I usually have to close and reopen TextSecure to fix the problem.

		Over the past week I've experienced a very strange failure mode. Me and person P were exhanging unsecured text messages. I was using TextSecure (push registered), while P was using a stock messaging app. At some point, TextSecure on my phone started thinking that P was registered with TextSecure, and switched to sending encrypted messages. I sent a few encrypted messages to P, which P never received. Upon learning that P wasn't receiving my messages, I tried ending the secure session with P on my phone. This had no effect: TextSecure still insisted on sending encrypted messages. I tried de-registering my phone and then registering it again, but that didn't help. Ultimately the only way to reach P was to de-register my phone and keep push disabled :( The most pressing issue is: Why did TextSecure think P was registered? P never installed TextSecure or Signal, and did not change their phone number, or anything like that. The secondary issue is: Why did TextSecure not allow me to send plain SMS, even after I selected &quot;end secure session&quot;? I looked at the log, and the only potentially relevant line I could find was this: W/Directory(22806): Adding active token: +*********xx, 47+CqoNE/Fv5gw (where xx is the last 2 digits of P's phone number, so I know the line corresponds to their account.) (PS. Is the debug log designed to be safe for posting in public, or is there a document describing which fields should be censored?) Version info for my device: Device  : LGE Nexus 4 (occam)

		When typing a really long message, textsecure used to block the typing when I reached the max length limit. It just happened to me that I exceeded that limit (without noticing) and sent a message that was automatically trimmed while being sent. Please notify the user that the message will be trimmed, or prevent the typing in the first place. Don't know in which version this problem arose

		I'm using CM12.1 / Android 5.1.1 on a Nexus 5 and noticed the following problem: One of my group messages failed to send and I got the &quot;Some issues need your attention.&quot; Message. When tapping on the message, another screen appeared stating &quot;Some issues need your attention.&quot; but with no further Information and no possibility to solve the Issue. Normally, green resend buttons appear next to the group members but in this case there was nothing next to their pictures and no buttons on the screen at all. Eventually I figured out how to resend the message. I needed to select the failed message and resend it in the top right corner options menu. Why wasn't there a resend button in the &quot;Some issues need your attention.&quot; Screen? Is this a bug or intentionally. Most of the time there appear individual resend buttons next to the contact pictures but not this time.

		If I look at my TextSecure contact list or directly in a contact conversation, there is no way to know if a contact has been verified or not. In case I'm not sure I can only verify the contact again to be 100% sure. It would be nice to have an indication of verified contact. I.e. it could be an orange dot for unverified and green dot for verified, or the lock in the conversation view could change is color when it's verified. Or at least on the &quot;Verify identity&quot; screen you should write: &quot;Successfully verified&quot;, Verified&quot; or &quot;Verified on + date/time&quot;, I don't know what is more suitable but I'm sure it would be a very useful and important feature to help people use the app in the best possible way.

If a image is available, it will display only one contact image, otherwise if an contact image is not available, the the first letter of the first contact's first name is shown. I would like to see group chat icons in the conversation list denoted with a tile view comprised of the group contacts (possibly up to 4 tiles). It seems the special TextSecure groups have a stock grey icon to denote those type of chats since they have a group title/name. For example, if there are 3 contacts in the group MMS (2 friends plus yourself) the visual icon on the conversation list would show a vertically split tile view of your contacts photo or the Letter of their first name if a photo is not available. For reference, is similar to the Google hangout view. [][] [][] [ __ ] [][] [][] Consider similar feature for the special TextSecure group icon. version 2.16.4

		it's possible to open the media preview activity when tapping on an attachment that is in the process of downloading (ie you're receiving it and only see the download icon). in this case you just see an empty (all black) media preview and upon tapping the save icon &quot;error saving to storage&quot;. super picky, but should be easy enough to prevent this from happening and I think it should be done. reproducible on master and f113792.

		I knew contact blocking and muting was implemented so went to search for it, found the muting real quick in the options menu but surprised to find that block was not right next to it. it took me ~3 minute of searching followed by a text to @moxie0 to figure out where block was, found it by tapping on contact name.

		When looking over at other apps for translation hints, I found Facebook messenger's way of handling the new feature : The time options make more sense IMO, and as you can see &quot;Mute&quot; has no literal translation in French and needs at least 3 words. Replacing &quot;Mute for 1 hour&quot; with &quot;For 1 hour&quot; helps a lot and &quot;Mute&quot; is already mentioned in the title.

		In the contact specific notification/block view the translations for &quot;Block&quot; and &quot;Unblock&quot; are not used. The former is recipient_preferences__block but I'm not sure of the latter. (Not that I would ever want to block this contact:) Edit: Also the translations for &quot;Enabled&quot; and &quot;Disabled&quot; for vibration are not used. Too lazy to edit the screenshot.

		I have a bad feeling I am not going to get a friendly response to this. :) My device (samsung gt-p5113) has TextSecure 2.5.3, which works fine. I recently was looking through the Play Store, and noticed that TextSecure was not listed among my apps. I searched for it, and when I found it, the app page said &quot;this version is not compatible with your device.&quot; I checked with some other people, and they had versions up to 2.17.0! Can someone explain why newer versions are &quot;not compatible,&quot; and (I hope) change something so that I am able to install newer versions, and keep up with development. Thanks.

		It is clear that uninstalling/reinstalling is a big problem for group chats. Receiving a message from a group makes it impossible to answer or open the keyboard or update the group. An idea to fix this could be this. You could add an &quot;restore/ask to rejoin&quot; option (available only when you detect that the user can't reply), which asks all the people who have written so far for the metadata of the group chat. This would be the least painful way for newbies to get around the current problem which requires an avatar update. Do you think this is feasible?

		I would like to set different notifications for group and direkt messages. When I get a direct message I like a rather intrusive notification while I don't want group messages to play the same ringtone all the time (example: threema). If you are bothered with the additional settings for this, please at least consider an option to only allow the first new message to spawn a notification and suppress the rest (for 1h?).

		(Creating new story from thread in #970) I'm seeing an alert that I have two new messages whenever TS is locked. Upon unlocking no message is received, and the alert disappears, but when TS is re-locked I once again get an alert for two &quot;Encrypted Message&quot;. (There are two messages from this contact that were sent to me but which I have still never received. This problem began immediately after these were sent.) I've uploaded a capture from logcat -v long while locking and unlocking to reproduce this. This problem has been ongoing for a week now. Re-initiating secure session does not help, restarting the phone does not help. Currently using the latest Play Store version: 2.18.2.

		Me and my friends all completely despise the Google emojis. I don't really know why, but the fact still remains that we do. With that said, I think a lot of people would be happy to see alternatives. Twitter's emojis are open source and look quite nice. Of course I would prefer Apple's, but those aren't open source at all so that might be a problem. I don't really see how WhatsApp could get away with using them though. With Signal for Iphone and Signal soon coming to Android, I think it's quite important that both people see the same thing. That's the way Telegram does it, and it makes sure both people see the exact same emojis. Some Apple/Google emojis are so different that it's not even funny. Yeah, I know Samsung for example has their own emojis, but that doesn't exactly make things easier. Is this being worked on? Is it even being considered? I even tried using Emoji Switcher to get Apple's emojis, but it just isn't working.

		I just set Textsecure as my default SMS app on Android. Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: &quot;Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK&quot; or &quot;Get privacy: SHORTLINK&quot; or &quot;Get this! SHORTLINK&quot; Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

		Attention seeking @2-4601 here, I'm here to inform you that the SMS invite strings (ConversationActivity_get_with_it, ConversationActivity_lets_use_this_to_chat) are schizophrenic. It's like TS can't decide which one should be used. When you tap the invite menu item they seem to come out so random that I'm gonna use this as a CSRNG. Here's an intense video I made for you to show this – only on Github: Stay still now: TS 2.19.0 Nexus 4, stock Android 5.1 Huawei U8800, Android 4.0.4

		What's your device? LG L90 D415 (Also confirmed issue on a Nexus 5.) What Android version is it running? 5.0.2 (Nexus 5 is running 5.1.1) What version of TextSecure do you have? 2.18.2 Are you push registered? Yes What are the relevant preferences that you have set that may be related to the issue? Friend installed TextSecure from the Play Store on his Nexus 5 and received a &quot;Connectivity error&quot; message during phone # verification. I then uninstalled the same version of TextSecure and reinstalled from the Play Store. I also received the same error message. The app was working fine prior to its reinstallation.

		Since the last few updates of TS (since 2.17.0 or so), I sometimes receive normal sms twice, although the other person only sent it once... it happens with different contacts and with around 1 in 15-20 sms... https://gist.github.com/381e55cf8f655ba2e186 I had the same problem in the past while using Android 4.1.2 (and I thought it was a problem with the ways, TS catches the SMS before the standard app), but with installing nAOSP 5.0.2 / 5.1.1 the problem ended, now it happens again

		My problem is that I have several contacts that tried TextSecure but uninstalled it after a short time without unregistering. Unfortunately they're also unwilling to use the unregister function on the Website and so I'm stuck with several phone numbers still shown as TextSecure Contacts and whenever I try to send a Message it automatically uses the push service instead of the normal SMS system. It would be helpful if there was a possibility to permanently deactivate push messages for certain contacts or even better, to automatically unregister contacts that have uninstalled the app.

		For starters, thanks for a wonderful app. There is a typo in the description for the latest update, 2.19.1 &quot;Changes in 2.19.1: ★ Bug fixes and performance enhnacements.&quot; &quot;enhancements&quot; isn't spelled like that. I slept like a rock last night, so I figured I should include a picture showing what I'm talking about in case that isn't clear. Also, next time I find something like this, should I write here or in the mail list? I already posted it in the Google+ Community Beta group, but I figured no one ever goes there. Really offtopic question, but is there any point in fixing the RedPhone translations? The program hasn't been updated for quite some time, and I'm not a collaborator in the Swedish translation so I can't actually edit the reviewed strings.

As I just notice, a group update helps to solve this (except for the avatar). reference: WhisperSystems/TextSecure-Browser#276 Edit: and probably related to #2581 Edit 2: Did not talk about old existing messages.

(and stored) using the stock sms app and not textsecure.. so I lose messages until I import messages in... but that results in dupes work around: I'd need to change back to the stock, delete all of the old messages. change to TS and import the messages I care about. change back to stock and delete the new messages.

		I've been using Textsecure for more than a year without a password. Today I decided I wanted to work with one. I used my SIM's PIN as the password (that's four digits). Now I can't enter the app. It says my password is invalid. I know the consequence is that I've lost all my messages. Not a drama but very annoying indeed. I've warned all of my friends using Textsecure to not use a password. It's simply not possible that I typed my PIN incorrectly when creating the password. I type it everyday many times and Textsecure asked me to repeat it before accepting it as the password, so something's definitely wrong with Textsecure regarding passwords.

		I'm not interested in groups. It's the very feature why I run away from Whatsapp. It creates too much noise. I'm not interested in having a chat room, which is what groups seem to be like (yes, I'm that old). But I do want to send messages to several people at once in many occasions. Is that possible at all with Textsecure? How do I do that?

		I just destroyed my message history when trying to use a password for Textsecure (I won't try it again...). Most of the lost messages were not important, but I'd like to keep my wife's ones. They also live in their phone, so I was thinking of backing them up, moving the backup to my phone and then import them into my new Textsecure install. Can I do that? How? (If it involves the use of a PC, I'm an Ubuntu user and consider myself &quot;computer literate&quot;, so feel free to suggest any solution no matter how convoluted. :-))

		I have family and friends using Textsecure. ALL of them asked me what was going on when I reinstalled Textsecure and they received a message telling them something about confirming me to their contact list again. The message looked scary to all of them and they didn't know what was going on. Why exactly is this being done? The phone number is the same. It should be trivial for the server to know this is just a reinstall. What am I missing?

		I am using a TS version from the 2.21 branch. I really like what I see! It just looks so good, I could spend the whole day scrolling my conversations up and down, lol However... my phone has a 4-inch screen; it's not huge, I know, but it's not that small either (to me it is just fine). And the incoming bubbles for messages I receive are a bit too narrow. Half the space of the screen is being wasted :/ Could you reduce the right margin? This is what a long message looks like (narrow and consequently very very tall)

		Sometimes I receive an MMS (over push) when I am offline; when I finally come back online, I get the MMS message with two different received timestamps. My guess is that one timestamp corresponds to the time sent, and the other time stamp corresponds to the time received. This seems to be confusing and unnecessary information for the user, who probably only cares about when the message is sent, and doesn't understand why the time stamps are different. Device info: Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, stock android 4.4.4, TextSecure 2.21.0? (I compiled from b7492eb) App state: Push registered, incoming SMS disabled, outgoing SMS fully disabled Debug logs: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/98fe3fb59609cd429909 Example here where the last picture received has a timestamp difference of about 4 minutes, because that's how long I was offline. Both of these screenshots were taken within a minute of each other.

		I've tried over and over and cannot register my phone for TextSecure. I live in a remote rural area and cannot get decent phone reception at the same time that I have a wifi connection. If I drive to a spot to receive the SMS then I lose the wifi connection. If I try to do Voice Verify then it says no network - presumably meaning no wifi connection. So it's impossible to register here. I almost got it once by driving out to get reception but the short time limit of 2 minutes cut off before the SMS that came in moments later. I don't understand why you have to make it so difficult to register the phone, or even why a secure messaging app needs to have my phone number registered in the first place. Is this some hidden tracking agenda - why need the phone number for text messaging. But my real point here is to let you know that registration is broken for people like me in rural areas. It seems the only way for me to do this is to wait for some day when I'm at some cafe with free wifi and decent phone reception both together. Can this not be made less onerous?

		I had a strange issue this weekend using version 2.20 of TS. I had a conversation with a non-ts user on iPhone (non-signal) and I also had a group conversation with that same user + a TS user on android. When I would send messages to the single-user conversation, said user would get duplicates of every message. I tried rebooting my phone, etc, to no avail. Once I deleted the mixed-group (TS/non-TS) the problem stopped. I accidentally submitted the log w/o grabbing the link for the log to post here. If this isn't enough info, feel free to nuke this, just thought we should have a record of it.

		My phone just updated from 2.20 to 2.21 (Moto G on 4.4.4). I think the new colors are not nearly as pretty or as useful as the 2.20 colors were. 2.20 was beautiful and extremely functional!!! You had it right! :-) The two major issues I find with the new colors are... Insufficient Variability: Before you had a nice wide array of colors for the recipient names. It was great because I didn't have to read, I knew which text was which user with a simple glance at the colors. Now most things are dark green/gray/blue and that information is lost, I'm back to reading the names to find the thread I want. Dark/Intense: The new colors are quite dark and quite intense. It almost looks like they're all some sort of warning messages. The last colors were calm and reassuring. Awesome work overall! Textsecure has come so far from where it was a year ago!

		The group color in 2.21.0 dark theme is the same blue as in light theme: The dark theme should have it's own color in groups as it has with private chats. (N.B.: The colors in the above screen shots are not accurate. I forgot to turn off my screen shading/color temperature altering app before taking those shots. But the issue is still valid :)

		The double ticks that were introduced in version 2.21.0 as status indicators are not intuitive. I guess they mean: one tick for &quot;message delivered to server&quot; two ticks for &quot;message delivered to chat partner(s)&quot; but these icons have nothing to do with the status. Even the former design (light blue until delivered to server and tick once it was delivered) was way more clear than now. What will happen if one day tha status for &quot;message read&quot; will be added. Three ticks? My suggestion: Look at Threema's status icons (grey envelope --&gt; dark envelope --&gt; mailbox --&gt; eye). I think this is one of these example where design killed usability.

		Using TextSecure 2.21.0 on Android 5.0.2 and my Samsung Galaxy Alpha, I recently noticed the following bug: If I reject an incoming call with a message and the corresponding number is given in the international format, e.g. +49..., the message will be instead send to %2B49... (cf. URL encoding) I could not check whether or not this also happens when using the default text messaging application. However, sending messages to such specially formatted numbers is not included by my flatrate.

		Hi, using 2.21.0 on Android 4.4.4 Since the update to 2.21.0 all my contacts have different colors. Apart from the ugly brown color for my girlfriend, I can't differ between a secure message and SMS now. Which was very easy in past (green/blue). Except for the small lock-icon in the message, which is really small. How about a possibility the change the contact-color? And make the difference between secure and not-secure more noticeable? Thx! Stefan

		Hello, so, apparently you finally made the switch for 2.22.0: 9a18be0 And you even seem to use the updated set. But the &quot;Raised Hand With Part Between Middle And Ring Fingers&quot; Emoji (A.K.A. &quot;Vulcan Salute&quot; Emoji&quot;), see: http://emojipedia.org/raised-hand-with-part-between-middle-and-ring-fingers/ apparently is missing from 2.22.0, even though it would be available from the set. So, could you please add it? Regards 👍 1

		Hi! I am am wondering why there is yet not an update on the still missing group SMS feature in Textsecure.The original issue concerning this question, issue #413, has already been opend in 2013 and now, in mid 2015, there is still no information, when the feature will be implemented. For 1 1/2 years this feature has been wished by a lot of people, as the lively discussion in #413 shows. But now, the conversation #413 has been locked and limited to collaborators ca. a month ago and you cannot participate in the discussion in #413 anymore. Why this limitation of the discussion? Can you provide us, please, with any concrete information, when the missing group SMS feaure will be implemented? Thanks! @moxie0 : I did not want to open a duplicate, but as it is technically impossible to write in #413 which is in general about the missing feature and not about technical details. I saw no other way. Sorry, if the new issue caused trouble. However,my question was not about a regular update service, but was only caused, as this group SMS feature request is open since quite a long time and I was wondering if it is still planned or not. Thanks again.

		On my HTC One S CM 12.1 with d6d881b the conversation list is visible in the place of the camera preview until the camera preview has loaded when I open direct capture or switch from/to 2nd camera or when the orientation changes or when coming back from screen lock with camera preview still open (not when toggling from half to full screen camera) Hard to screen-shoot this... it's like the convo itself only fills half (or nothing on full screen camera) the screen letting the previous activity sneak through (popup-like).

But if I select the failed message and click on the &quot;i&quot; in the ActionBar there is an additional &quot;Resend&quot; button displayed next to Alice. Afaik it shouldn't be there if you have to verify someone, otherwise messages will be sent multiple times after verfifying...

		Hi, since the introduction of the new colors, the dark theme has become brighter. It's good on one hand, but it's slightly annoying on the other. I think the background in conversations should be darker (maybe pure black? I think it used to be darker). This way it would be less similar to the color of sent bubbles and the general look would be less bright. Does that make sense?

		How difficult would it be to implement a search function on a per conversation basis? Personally, I've had many times where I've wanted to look up a particular detail that I've forgotten, such as an address, and have had to scroll back through all the messages to find it. Thoughts?

		Hey Team, I'm not sure if I have to report missing translation here because it's just a bug tracker. Where should I do it? Never the less if you use textsecure in German and you get a message it shows as possibilities &quot;Mark read&quot; and &quot;Antworten&quot;. Shouldn't be it &quot;Gelesen markieren&quot; and &quot;Antworten&quot;? Maybe even just &quot;Gelesen&quot;?

		The implementation of Apple emoji in 9a18be0 is difficult to read in conversation (Nexus 5, xxhdpi), due to reduction in displayed size, as well as more colors and details in Apple's emoji images. For reference, behold a short story about MERS, preferably on an xxhdpi mobile screen: Google Emoji (fa62b9b 2015-07-02) Apple Emoji (9a18be0 2015-07-06) A quick code comparison: src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/emoji/EmojiProvider.java (Google emoji, fa62b9b)   public static final double EMOJI_SMALL      = 0.60;
  public static final int    EMOJI_RAW_HEIGHT = 96;
 src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/emoji/EmojiProvider.java (Apple Emoji, 9a18be0)   public static final double EMOJI_SMALL      = 0.60;
  public static final int    EMOJI_RAW_HEIGHT = 64;
 Changing EMOJI_SMALL to 0.90 (96 * .6 / 64) restores emoji height to where it was before:

		when you click at the magnifier in the main screen textsecure should search all messages instead of searching a contact. why? (1) because it is an inbox of messages and most email-programs behave like this (2) when you compose a new message then you already got a contact search (3) nearly every android smartphone has a contact manager where you can search for contacts and open the corresponding chat from there (if you've set ts as the standard messenger you'll be redirected to ts..)

			<description>
		Hello, the incoming message bubbles in TextSecure 2.21.0 have a colored background (color depends on setting per contact) and the text inside those incoming message bubbles is white. So far that is fine. But: The lock symbol and the date in those incoming message bubbles basically have the same color as the bubble's background, which results in a very low contrast and bad readability. In comparison: The outgoing message bubbles in TextSecure 2.21.0 have a white background and the text inside those outgoing message bubbles is black/dark gray. And the lock symbol and the date in those outgoing message bubbles have the same (or similar) contrasting color as the message text (black/dark gray), which results in a much better readability. So: Could you please change the lock symbol and the date in the incoming message bubbles to a white color? With white they would have a much better contrast to the colored background and would have a much better readability. PS: The phone number in the conversation toolbar (the phone number that is being displayed below the chat partner's name) has the same issue. So it would be nice if you would change that to a white color as well. Regards

		Hello, with TextSecure 2.21.0 you can change the color for each contact. When changing the color, the color for the conversation toolbar changes as well. So it's a bit like changing the theme color. However, the attachment button inside the conversation remains blue (default theme color) for example. It would be really nice if you could add an option to TextSecure which would allow to change not just the color for each contact, but also change the theme color globally, so that the color is changed everywhere, including the main screen and settings and so on. Or with other words: Currently the default color in the TextSecure &quot;Light&quot; theme is blue. I'd like to have an option to change this default color to something else. Any chance you could do that? It could be placed under Settings -&gt; Appearance. It would be much appreciated. Regards

		Phone: Moto G 2014 TS version: commit 7593918 Steps to reproduce. Open coveation Click smiley face emoji button to pull emoji drawer Attempt to make a selection while the screen is scrolled down n &gt; 2 rows Expected outcome: The selected emoji is displayed. Actual outcome: No emoji is displayed. Incorrect emoji is displayed. Example: While the emoji selection box is scrolled exactly two lines down, clicking fearful-face yields face-savouring-delicious-food, and clicking weary-face yields face-with-medical-mask. Further, with the box scrolled exactly three lines down, clicking fearful-face yields confounded-face.

		In Austria we are mainly using E.164 format on mobile numbers I.e. +43 664 12345678. If I receive a call and send a quick response it will be sent to the wrong number: 243664 12345678 instead of +43 664... It seem like the plus is converted to a 2.

		It would be great if one could hide the emoji button and/or replace it with something more useful (e.g. attachment button). There are various reasons why one might not need the emoji button: The keyboard used might already provide an emoji button (as in my case). One might prefer to use/type old-fashioned ASCII emojis, therefore not needing the advanced emoji menu provided by TextSecure. One might not want to use emojis at all. and probably some more that I can't think of...

		Some want uniformity and emoji can get lost in translation but this is not a TextSecure problem and shouldn't be fixed here. Even if it were to be fixed here, why settle on the Apple ones? I can't see how many people have installed Signal but there are 253 ratings, compared to 19,627 ratings for TextSecure. Would iOS users like Android emoji? Probably not. Most people likely prefer whatever they're used to, so it's better to let the system handle the look instead of forcing everyone to use the Apple ones which look really cheap and doesn't fit in at all on Android. TextSecure uses one set of emoji while the rest of the system and other apps uses another now. Also notifications still use the system emoji and apparently nothing can be done about this. The inconsistencies look really sloppy. Adding options is usually not a good idea but the same goes for changing the look that people are used to, so if anything there should be a &quot;compatibility mode&quot; where those who want to make sure nothing gets lost in translation can switch to Apple emoji.

		When in a secure session with SMS/MMS support enabled, the End secure session button doesn't work to end the session. This may be by design, I'm not sure, but it doesn't work well if I'm sending a regular message to a contact who uses a separate app for regular texts (but who is also registered for TextSecure) and doesn't want to sign in to read any message I send them. If both parties are solely using TextSecure then it doesn't matter, but it should probably be up to the user to decide on the communication protocol.

		When attaching a picture to a text and sending, the sending icon/circle remains on the picture and spins endlessly without disappearing. Recipients sometimes do receive the picture, but the sending icon never stops spinning and wears the battery down unless it is forced to quit. It seems to work a little better with other textsecure users, but not at all with non-textsecure users. I notice the same behavior/problem on a Nexus 6 and HTC One M7 GPE - both with latest version of lollipop.

		First off, the gist of the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b4bd3001d8c0525e81c9 I've used TextSecure for a long while, but I only very recently picked up my first contact who also uses it. I was so excited when I sent my first message! I was slightly less excited when she said that all she received was a &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; error. I did some debugging on my end, which led to a debug log that looked something like the one that I posted above (but without the crash). This morning however, her &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; to me also resulted in TextSecure crashing upon receiving the message. I don't know why today's message exchange led to a crash but the previous ones didn't. I'm also confused as to why I'm trying to JSON decode an HTML error message. Any ideas as to what could be going on and/or suggestions on what to try next?

It won't verify my phone and it wont call me to do a voice verify either. I have uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times. I have tried it on 3g and wifi no luck.

			<description>
		On Android 4.4.4, TextSecure version 2.21.0 (Sony Xperia Tablet Compact Z3) I found that pasting an extremely long draft message (I was inspired by #3388) into the new message box will bring up the max message length indicator without actually enforcing it. Hence we can get negative characters remaining as shown below. I was still able to send this message without issue to a Signal app; interestingly it causes Signal to crash while trying to load the message. I'm assuming that the desired behavior is to actually enforce message length restrictions, so I will look into this. Steps to Reproduce: Write a really long draft message until you get past 2000 characters. Profit.

		Starting off with the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/76b13998ebfb86b7142c As we discussed in #3642, I had previously used Titanium Backup, which I had learned after doing so is frowned upon. So I went with the nuclear option of nuking my TextSecure install (wiped data, reinstalled too just for good measure), and starting fresh. The above debug log is after nuking everything. I have a bit more details about what's going on this time, too. First, and probably most importantly, is that the person on the other side of this issue is running WhisperPush version 5.0.2-30bd462d41 on a OnePlus running CM (which is the stock OS on the device). My encrypted push messages to them are good, but I just receive the &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; error. They can exchange messages with other WhisperPush users, but I'm currently not sure about other TextSecure users. Normal SMS works, but that's probably not shocking. Normal MMS also works. Thoughts/suggestions?

		Hello. Ever since updating to 2.22.1 I've had problems with TextSecure freezing. This almost always leads to a box that says &quot;TextSecure isn't responding&quot; and regardless of what I do at that point, it crashes 8-10 seconds later. At first I thought WhisperSystems#3624 might still be spooking, but I don't think it's related. The camera crashing was always instantaneous, and usually happened when I flipped my phone. Now it happens out of the blue. Yesterday it happened while writing a message to a person who wasn't even writing back at the moment, which means it can't be WhisperSystems#3642 Samsung Galaxy Nexus Kitkat 4.4.4 Paranoid Android TextSecure 2.22.1 Started happening with latest update. Never happened before. The picture shows what happened right before it crashed. I was about to add an emoji and then everything freaked out. https://gist.github.com/d145fd936f2ebda89015 https://gist.github.com/514168cd604f1ead7faf

		...leading to an inconsistent user experience on their devices. Possible solution: In order to enable a more unified experience accross different devices and platforms, Textsecure could use the same Emoji set as the default setting for the app, but allow the user to fall back to the device's system Emoji set if the user prefers a more consistent experience on their device. (Sorry for abusing the issue tracker as a discussion forum earlier, I wasn't aware that this was frowned upon here.)

		The only reason TS isn't my default messenger is because per user tones help me decide if the contact is worthy of a reply at any given time. For example if my wife texts I will pull over and see what she needs. If it is a business contact after hours I can safely check it at any convenient time or the next day. Thanks for all you do.

		Some users really, really don't like the Apple emoji, and won't use TextSecure any more because of that. I know, it sounds really petty. However, I have (or rather, had) five contacts using TextSecure (4 Android, 1 iphone), and since the release to the Play Store of version 2.22.2, two of the Android contacts have stopped using it and gone back to unencrypted SMS because of the Apple emoji. I've seen the contributing guide: &quot;[t]he answer is not more options&quot;. I'm not saying the right thing to do is add a user-visible preference. I don't know what the right action is. However, I've gone from having the majority of my texts encrypted to having virtually none of them encrypted, and the new emoji are what touched it off.

		I am having a similar problem to some of the other guys but mine seems to go a little further. My contacts don't seem to link with my messages, but also when I send an SMS with some of my contacts the phone will automatically send the message to other contacts too. I will then get replies from other people not knowing why I am texting them but very rarely will the intended recipient get the actual message. With one if my contacts I have given up texting him now and I have resorted to using whatsapp. This is very very confusing for me and I must admit I have no idea why its happening. Furthermore I feel very unable to fix it. Can anyone help me??

 Also the title ApplicationPreferencesActivity_disable_storage_encryption Disable storage encryption?
 might need a revise. The new setting does not explicitly say anything about encryption anymore: Enable lock screen for messages
 Is this intentional (as in &quot;There are no power users&quot;)? If so then some of the above strings need more adjustments. TS 2.23.0

		Hello, this is a follow-up issue to: WhisperSystems#3317 I know that this should have been fixed by @mcginty via 9b2aabf and yes, it's much better now (thanks for that), but it's still not solved. You can easily reproduce it by doing the following steps for example: Have an empty message input box Insert an Emoji into the message input box via the TextSecure Emoji drawer Hit the space key on the keyboard to insert a space after the Emoji Now you should see that the Emoji has suddenly moved it's position a bit down Press backspace on the keyboard to remove the space again Now you should see that the Emoji is centered again Could you please fix it? Regards

		When there's an option in your used keyboard to open an emoji drawer (see pic3), then it uses the default system Emojis (Android - see pic1). When Pressing on the Emoji button of Textsecure at the left side of the TextEntryBox, then it uses the the TextSecure/Apple emojis (pic2). I think this breaks consistency in the user interaction and should be adressed.

		It just dismisses the keyboard but the message isn't sent. If I long press the enter key, the keyboards emoji drawer gets open with another enter button. This enter button inserts a new line which is shown as a space in the EditText but as a new line in the sent message. Tested on N4 Android 5.1.1 and HTC Desire 2.3.7 both running TS 2.23.0

		When rotating the conversation list from portrait to landscape mode (by rotating the phone), the message previews of the conversations are often not adjusted to the new (wider) screen width. They then stay exactly at the same length they had in portrait mode. Most often, this happens after returning from (single) conversation view to the conversation list via the &quot;Back&quot; button. I'm currently using v2.23.0.

		Hi, When I write a message in landscape orientation, the keyboard does not show its text prediction suggestions. Even worse, the keyboard automatically corrects words it does not know, without giving me the possibility to chose or add them to the dictionary. This only occurs when writing a message in landscape mode. In portrait mode, the keyboard works like it is supposed to be. Also in other apps, writing in landscape mode shows the prediction suggestions. System: HTC Desire, cyanogenmod 7.2.0.1-bravo, textsecure: 2.21.0, stock keyboard (german) Attached some screenshots: 01: textsecure app in landscape mode (predictions are missing) 02: textsecure app in portrait mode (predictions are shown) 02: note taking app in landscape mode (predictions are shown) Please let me know if you need any further information. And after all: Thanks for providing textsecure!

		I am using SwiftKey, but I think this also fits to other keyboards. When typing a message on other messages, the Enter button is replaced by a Smiley button. If inputType for EditText field of messaging would be changed to textShortMessage the behavior would be adjusted to match other messengers, where a smiley is more likely used than Enter.

		Reproduce: Remove all apps from Androids &quot;Recent Apps&quot; TS message arrives, notification appears Open the conversation by clicking on the notification read/answer/whatever and return with the back key Result: Instead of returning to the main view of TS, as expected, the conversation activity closes without opening the main activity When wanting to switch to TS using &quot;Recent Apps&quot; at any later time the conversion gets opened, also with no ability to come back to the main view Expected: Always show the conversation list when pressing back in a conversation Or is this behavior intentional, because &quot;well...thats how Android works&quot;?

		Hi, Just started using TextSecure. I have a few requests / suggestions but for starters could we have more choice of theme colours? For example I'd like to have a white background for the main window with the title bar and new message 'bubble' in black. So, I guess a full palette of colours would be best that can be chosen with a white or black background, with the option to have contact 'bubbles' match the chosen theme colour. Thanks

		Feature request: Would be nice to be able to copy multiple messages at a time. So for example if I wanted to copy the above two messages to send to someone else that could be highly convenient. The copy icon goes away when you select multiple messages, leaves you with only the ability to delete. I realize there's some difficulty with how to perform the actual copying. I would assume the &quot;right thing to do&quot; would be to grab all of the text selected and mash it into one big string that gets put in paste clipboard.

		Screenshot Some of the contacts images are not shown in a circled shape. I didn't find out, how to reproduce this so far... however it looks like this can be &quot;solved&quot; by changing or even re-adding the contact picture via the Android contacts.

			<description>
		Whenever attempting to use the direct capture feature, after taking the picture, it shows up in the draft view (and in the sent picture) as noise. Whatever is going on is deterministic, as visually similar scenes create visually similar corrupted pictures, and visually different scenes create visually different images. This is the draft of a picture of a grey wall: This is after it's sent to myself (though this happens to any recipient): The loading-wheel-of-death is also probably a bug, but unrelated, and only happens when sending to myself, so not really a major concern. The actual picture it sends: which is obviously a correctly formatted jpeg, it's the content that's wrong. Happens on TextSecure 2.23 and 2.23.1. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S II running Cyanogenmod 11 (which is Android 4.4). Sending photos via attachment (both selecting a picture and the &quot;Take Photo&quot; feature) works fine.

		Send or receive a message that has only emojis and is so long that it does not fit into a single message bubble line TS will display only e number of emojis where e is the number of emojis sent/received mod the number of emojis that fit in one message bubble line E.g. If I send 14 cat emojis on my Huawei device which can have a maximum of 12 cat emojis per sent message bubble line then TS will only show 2 (= 14 mod 12) cat emojis in the sent message bubble: TS 2.23.1 Huawei U8800, 4.0.4 (pictured on the left) Nexus 4, stock 5.1.1 (pictured on the right) Related #3653

		Unfortunately my number is registered on the CyanogenMod servers and I've been unable to unregister it. Regardless, I'd been using TextSecure anyway as I like it as a messaging app. Having just reinstalled from source I now can't seem to get past TextSecure's registration phase, which I recall bypassing previously when I got the Cyanogen error. I'm guessing this is an intentional policy change? Can't use the app at all without registration? Sorry for the banal issue but I haven't been able to find another issue or pull request about this. Thanks!

		Hi, I am a big fan of TextSecure and just discovered the new version (2.32.2) in the Google Play store. Unfortunately, the app is requesting a lot of new permissions. The stated reason is so you can integrate RedPhone later on, which makes sense to make TextSecure more like Signal. While I don't want to imply that I think you guys are doing anything fishy with my data, you will surely understand that people might not install a secure messaging app that has just about access to anything. For example, I cannot see how access to my Calendar is important to exchange messages nor to make phone calls. I think it would really serve you and the community well if you would put an explanation of all the permissions in a prominent place on the open whisper systems website. Having this information easily accessible (link from Google store to that site?) will help users to build trust. Of course anyone can read the code to see that you are not up to anything, but that isn't a good enough answer here since not many people will have the time nor the technical expertise to do so. If your code is audited you could add information about audits on your website, stating who did the audit, with which version of the app and link to their results. Thanks!

		Hi, seems there was a mixup - in the latest TextSecure for Android, Apple's Emoticons are bundled with the app. This doesn't fit the system, obviously. Revert should be trivial, no?

		Not everyone wants to use all the features, but the standard install now asks for calendar, microphone (in RedPhone preparation), location, and other permissions. How about a second smaller TextSecure version that really is just a limited secure messenger? Should not even be able to take pictures. Even though it is Open Source and I could check things, most people cannot and hence less Android permissions would create more trust. Please consider two builds, one full featured and one with just messaging capabilities. You might even kill SMS support and make it even less requiring. Thanks.

		I found it very useful to be able to identify which users are signal/textsecure users. e.g. I know person_A is traveling to country_X and should not be contacted over SMS, before the contact list revamp I could very easily see whether a message to them would be via sms or TextSecure. Following the revamp I have to. go to contacts select contact start typing something to see if I get TS or SMS send (because &quot;attach&quot; is the default option on a new message) Request Can we can some sort of visual indication of whether a contact is a TextSecure user in the contact list?

		Before every group message the sender's name is displayed in a separate screen row. It would save space when the name would be displayed e.g. within the message bubble before or after the time. Alternatively/additionally, displaying names in group conversations might be a setting (ideally on a per-group basis), since there may be no need for names when avatars are distinctible.

		Tried to share a contact in my address book today via TextSecure which I couldn't do as, although TextSecure is set as the default text messaging app, it doesn't appear on the 'Send To' menu when using 'Share' in the Address Book. The stock Android messaging app is there which of course I couldn't use as it's not the default. I did try searching for this as an issue here so hopefully it's not a dupe.

			<description>
		Contacts without assigned images in the default Google contacts app (also used in the default phone dialer) are assigned a color which normally cannot be changed. Recently however, I've noticed that contacts of the people who are TextSecure registered users do change. The color changes are seemingly random (one was grey, then light blue, red, orange, now purple), and I have yet to find a pattern as when they happen (once it occurred right after I switched back to the contact screen from TextSecure; sometimes I only notice when I open the phone dialer). When it happens all of the contacts of TextSecure users change at once. I'm not exactly sure what causes the problem, but I'm pretty sure it is an issue with TextSecure since all my contacts' colors stay the same except for those who also use TextSecure (even one whom I've never actually texted). Note that this does not apply to the colors that you can assign people within TextSecure; those remain the same. Changing them within TextSecure is probably not the impetus for a change in contacts either, since one that I've never changed within TextSecure has changed in Google contacts. I wonder if it has something to do with the new searching contacts screen in TextSecure? I feel it happens more often after I go to that screen, but that's just a guess. I'm using TextSecure 2.23.2 on a Nexus 5 running Android 5.1.1. Here is a log, if that helps: https://gist.github.com/e5166ff4b9b0ea4b55e0

 From the code there it seems the session files in the /data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms/files/sessions-v2 dir should have already been migrated to version 3, which was not the case for me. The files in this location were mostly version 2 and even some version 1 on my phone... After I deleted these session files I was able to start the app again. But sending a secure message afterward resulted in it directly crashing again. And now again, it crashes on start, when trying to resend the pending message.

		Go to a conversation with Eva (a contact with a short name) Receive a message from Reinhold (a contact with a longer name) Tap the notification to open the conversation with Reinhold Notice that Reinhold's name is truncated as R... TextSecure seems to use the length of the contact name in the previous conversation (the length of Eva's name) as the basis to ellipsize the contact name in the conversation that was opened through a notification (Reinhold). TS 2.23.3, Nexus 4, stock 5.1.1 I guess this is somewhat related to the latter part of #3718.

		After opening TextSecure from a new message notification (via notification bar), it is not possible to switch ConversationActivity into landscape mode by rotating the phone. The orientation simply doesn't change. This is not reproducible by opening TS normally via launcher icon. In this case everything is fine. I'm using an HTC One S with Cyanogenmod 11 M12. The problem exists approximately since v2.22. I can't remember the exact release, sorry. Let me know if more information is needed.

		In the light of #3834 it would be great to have some status signalling to the users of the app. I think of something like https://status.github.com/ for the server infrastructure more detailed output for the user (yes I'm aware that most users don't care, but some would know why message sending fails, so hide it by default and add a button 'detailed error messages' or sth) Thanks. BTW you rule ;-)

Unfortunately Textsecure ignores the soundsettings of my phone. It rings the bell either if its set to vibration or if the sound is disabled. No difference between push message or sms. Device info: Samsung Galaxy S4 Min, CM 11 (latest), TextSecure 2.23.2 App state: Push registered, incoming SMS enabled, outgoing SMS fully enabled Thanks for your great tool.

		This seems similar to #2358, but is still present in the latest version. I use Aviate launcher (3.0.1.3). After installing TextSecure I imported my device SMS database. Initially the unread badge is not shown, but after a few minutes the &quot;4&quot; appears. I marked all as read using &quot;Mark all read&quot; in the context menu (though none were actually unread). This had no effect. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app made the badge go away, but it returned as soon as I imported SMS. Log, including my system and version details: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4f9112b7c7a3ea8e5b49

		In TextSecure, if I want to send the same message to multiple persons I can create a group first and send the message to the group. However then everyone in the group becomes aware that it is a group message -- in other words groups are always global. It would be nice to either send to multiple recipients without the need for creation of groups (I think this has already been requested) or allow the creation of groups which are local, so that we can send the same message to multiple people without the recipients being aware of the fact.

		Hi! Debug log is at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cf13994aa7ab1343066a and hopefully isn't terribly embarrassing. I sent a friend a single message and got one of the JSON errors in the log. Being stubborn, I tried many more times and got many more errors. Disabling TextSecure servers for messages (forcing the SMS fallback, right?) causes the message to go through, no crash, no problem. I just updated TS to 2.23.3 and my Android version is 5.0.x on a Nexus 5. Not super-confident of the actual Android version as it was an OEM-provided phone, not purchased through my service provider. Hope this helps!

		https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/crypto/MasterCipher.java#L65 As it turns out, over the course of loading the items in the conversation list view, Cipher.getInstance is called 32 times from its various initializations and takes ~100ms of main thread time per dataset change, which means ~300-500ms of main thread time per message sent since the cursor is reloaded up to 5 times when a message is sent. Seems like we should either have one MasterCipher instance that we pass along to the various Mms/SmsDatabase readers or at least have the Cipher instances be static singletons.

		I am on a thread, clicking the 'lock' symbol on top, and selecting 'End secure session'. The auto generated message 'Secure session ended.' is sent and received(have message receipt request turned on, 2 check marks). Next message either sent or received is still secured!(has lock symbol on message). Have tried multiple times now. Would prefer not un-registering from the TS server just to text someone who is wanting to uninstall TS (unrelated problem with keyboard not liking TS) HTC One M8 TS 2.23.3 Android 5.0.1

		I'm on the translate team for TextSecure and SMSSecure for the Dutch language, and I noticed in both projects some inconsistencies. In Dutch, you have 2 forms for the English &quot;you&quot; (ignoring the &quot;thou&quot; form here): the informal &quot;jij&quot;, and the more formal &quot;u&quot;. I noticed both forms are used in translations, probably depending on the personal preference of the translator of the specific string. In French you have &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot;, in German &quot;du&quot; and &quot;sie&quot;, but I didn't check the French and German translations to see if the forms are mixed there too. I don't know any other languages well enough to say if it can be an issue there. In current Dutch both forms are socially acceptable (although some mostly elder people frown on the use of the informal form). I would suggest the app choose one of the forms to be more consistent. Having both forms mixed makes a sometimes strange impression. I have no strong personal preference for either form. What is the opinion of the developers?

		If you expand the notification drawer, there are 9 lines (in my case) of message text shown. There is no indication for how many messages were received or if there is more text. If you received more than 9 lines (wrapped single message, multi line single message, multiple messages) then there should be ellipsis in the ninth line, like it is done for the multiple thread notification. And as of the current sort order this gets even more confusing. You see the most recent message in the collapsed notification and it is not shown (or indicated to be anywhere) when you expand the notification (when there 9+ lines of notification) Can screenshoot if my description is too confuse 😉 Edit: ... and totally forgot to demand a message count indicator

		This is TextSecure 2.23.3 running on and LG L40 with the default LG Android 4.4.2 (Build number KOT49I.A1399985852, Software version V10d-EUR-XX). In one of my group chats the keyboard is not showing when I try to focus the text input. It works as expected in &quot;singe user chats&quot; and the only other group chat I'm part of. The broken group chat looks like this: When I hit the text field labelled &quot;Send TextSecure message&quot; nothing happens. I suspect that the group chat is in some strange state as the group is named &quot;Unnamed group&quot; and I can't see any other group members from the menu: Navigating to &quot;Conversation settings&quot; I get the following screen: Also, I can add for example a picture but can't hit the send button, i.e., the send button doesn't do anything when I hit it. As far as I recall I have reinstalled my phone (and thereby TextSecure) since the group chat was created.

		In different preferences sliders (switchcompat?) are used. In the light theme, they are the TS blue which looks great, while in the dark theme they are aqua. While this is certainly not a show-stopper, it would look nicer if they matched the same blue or a more muted blue than having them be aqua. For someone who knows Android dev, unlike myself, this is probably pretty easy.

 Basically, I wanted to check the current status of the TextSecure-Browser project. Since I'm lazy, rather than rebuilding the android application to use the staging server and create another account, I wanted to try to use it to contact my mother and I modified the javascript sources to not use the staging servers (I just removed the -staging string from the urls, as a wild guess) I thought: what's the worse that could happen? the messages might just fail to be delivered well, apparently I was wrong... maybe because the browser plugin expects a newer version of the app, but now I always get the above exception. The problem still happens even after removing/disabling the extension on my browser. The exception doesn't happen if I put the phone in airplane mode, but otherwise it keeps crashing (and showing the related popup) I tried to find a way to disassociate my browser from the phone, but apparently there's no such option. Rebooting the phone didn't help. I frankly could do without TextSecure for a few days... I'd switch back to the normal sms app until this issue would be fixed. But afaik, the only way I could do that, is by uninstalling textsecure/removing the account. Unfortunately this would then create a new key and I'd need to notify my new contacts of the changed fingerprint. I'd like if there was a day to do one of the following things: Tell textsecure to stop connecting altogether Tell textsecure to disable automatic restart Export my textsecure's private key (ok, this is less than ideal, but I'm already suffering from a self-inflicted DOS :P ) Also, I understand that an Android application's lifecycle is not as simple as a normal Java app, so it might not be that easy. But is there no way to have a top-level catch-all exception that recognizes such an issue, increments a counter to detect if the failure was a one-off or is cronical, and does something sane (temporarily disabling itself... don't let the exception bubble up to the system, etc.)? Thank you

		When I receive a notification of a new message in landscape mode and tap on it, it takes me into the thread I have with that contact but the contact's name is in a smaller font than normal. If I use the top left arrow button to go to the list of threads, then go back into that contact it is back to normal. This does not occur if I receive the notification and tap it in portrait mode.

Because the support forum has no related entries, I regard this as a bug and report it here. First device: Android 4.0.3, second device: Android 4.0.4.

		I had to revert to using my backup handset and now I don't seem to be able to send sms messages to a friend who is also running TextSecure. I checked and normal SMS go through OK. Is this because I changed handsets and then changed back to my original one? When I try and send a message using TextSecure it fails to send. I've uploaded my debug log; https://gist.github.com/anonymous/50d59c24fa2fcf21c814

		I have a conversation with this friend of mine that recently has been causing a lot of problems. (This happened on 2.24 too, so it shouldn't be 2.25-related) So basically: I type a message Hit send Wait... Sometimes the message bubble appears, sometimes it crashes before it does I reopen ts, unlock it, go to the conversation and the message bubble is there. The message is also correctly marked as send and delivered debug log: https://gist.github.com/a3061a1f4b7edfcfdcab

		I am not sure if this is the way to reproduce it, but here is what I did Change private notifications settings so that TS only displays the name I chatted for a while, etc etc, everything works fine (by the way I think that &quot;Contents hidden&quot; should be in italics in the notification area) I switched back to the standard setting so that TS displays name and message Now TS doesn't ring anymore when I receive messages, unless it's a message from a contact that has a custom ringtone

		The wording of several strings is inconsistent regarding the use of 'SD Card' and 'Storage', although all of these strings refer to the very same thing (as seen in the source code). I'd like to do a small PR correcting that, but want to gather information first what term is prefered. Some things to consider: As far as I know, TextSecure is not able to access a 'real' SD card when using KitKat or Lollipop. The term 'SD card' could be confusing to users with no SD card slot on their phone. The concept of a 'emulated SD card' could be even more confusing to those users ('There are no power users'). Possible terms: SD card storage device storage external storage (thx, @2-4601) anything else? I'd appreciate your input!

		After receiving a group message, TextSecure now crashes as soon as I open the app. I didn't see an issue that was similar, so here are the details: Device info: Blackphone BP1, Android 4.4.2, TextSecure 2.25.1 App state: Not push registered, used for incoming SMS/MMS Debug log: https://gist.github.com/red-coracle/58fd3e2d5e90c1e5168a Since I couldn't get into the app for a log, I used adb and copied what I thought was relevant. Let me know if you need more info. Thanks!

		I appear to be stuck on 2.22.2 of TextSecure. When I visit the Google Play page, it tells me &quot;Your device isn't compatible with this version&quot;. I can use the latest WhatsApp just fine, and this is the first time I've ever encountered this issue with an app so I don't think this is a permissions problem. Any ideas why the latest version would be incompatible? Do we need Android &gt; 4.1.2 to get the latest versions now?

		I did not find an issue for this or close to this. For some of the GCM problems it could be helpful to register the phone new at GCM. When messages arrive only after openting TS, doing this (via Threema) helps sometime. Maybe it would be helpful to implement it directly in TS (maybe in the advanced settings?). Regards

		I've now experienced a couple of times that the LED doesn't blink at all after receiving a message. With some messages it blinks, with others it doesn't (most work). I've recently played with the Custom Blink Pattern option, but set it back to normal afterwards. Around that time the problem started. Would a debug log sent directly after receiving such a message help? TS v2.25.3, Nexus 5, Android 5.1.1 Edit: My girlfriend seems to experience the same issue occasionally. I don't think she has tampered with the Custom Blink Pattern option, though.

		It should be possible to register a TextSecure account without giving Whisper Systems, or my contacts, my phone number. I think it's curious that an application with a strong focus on privacy requires the disclosure of this highly identifying piece of information - but I understand that this is caused by the origin of TextSecure as an SMS app. With that left behind, the road is now open to permit users to use another kind of identifier. A natural choice would be email addresses.

		I installed TextSecure and used my Google Voice number to verify. I then texted someone to test it out and it successfully used my Google Voice number to send the text message. Then, a day or two later, I noticed that I was receiving my text messages in Hangouts and not in TextSecure anymore. I texted someone to see what number it was using and it was my other, non-Google Voice number. I did not do anything in the settings that I think could have caused it to switch to that.

		This is my first post. I just compared textsecure with whatsapp and found that many features is required. Hereby i try to list the most required features. Audio call Brodcast Profile Pic Status Last seen Typing Wallpapper or Custom Background Email Chat Location Share Delete Account Change Number Optiin to Auto download media I just mentioned above features after comparison with whatsapp. Its not necessary that we build application like whatsapp but above mentioned features is required for any messenger application. I also found some issue in ts. Like if you add any friends in group after that admin can not remove any friends from the group. Admin must remove any member from group. When some members post text message in group then notification shows that this friends post text message but does not show the group name, so we think that this is private message but actually its group message. Other issue is we only select one image at time, we must select 10 to 20 image at time. Sorry for my bad English but i tried to contribute to this awesome app. Thanks Bahadursinh

		Hello, if I receive a lot of messages in a groupchat, TextSecure begins with the newest/last message and don't show the point of the first unread message. It's very inconvenient, if I receive a lot of unread messages, in a groupchat! (The messages are chronological right, but TextSecure scrolls to the last message.) 👍 5

		(At minimum) Samsung S2 SMS app has this feature on stock rom; when you receive a new message, the screen briefly lightens up. Fairly handy if you got used to it, especially at work with the phone on silent. (LED notification doesn't work with that phone).

		Currently, it is possible to choose a different ringtone per conversation. However, it does not seem to be possible to have no ringtone for a specific conversation, while having some ringtone (the system one, in my case) for all the others: The per-conversation ringtone selection lacks the &quot;None&quot; option. 👍 1

		When I manually verify a contact's identity by comparing the fingerprint or scanning the corresponding QR code I can't later see that I have verified the identity, can I? I am expecting that TextSecure helps me remember which contacts I already have verified. Is this feature missing on purpose?

		By default when you send a message to an other TextSecure user it needs a data connection to be delivered. Sometimes I know the recipients to my messages (TextSecure users) are not in data range at their location. It is frustrating to think you can send a message to a non-user in that same location and he/she will get it (as it will be a SMS over the regular cellular network), whereas a user won't... Sometimes having the message reach its destination is more important than keeping the content private. I wish I could have an option to 'just once' send the message as regular SMS when texting other users.

		First of all: I'm not a dev but I really like the style of the attachment drawer in the stock android messenger. So I wanted to know if it would be possible to implement some similar style in TextSecure as it offers all the &quot;features&quot; we have or we will have in the future (except stickers). It has the same quick capture layout, a gallery, (stickers), audio messages (push-to-talk style) and send location. Maybe some dev could take a look at it and tell us if this would be possible. I (personally) think the design is just great 😄

		On a Kyocera Rise C5155 running Android 4.0.4, in TextSecure 2.17.0, the icons for contacts take a long time to load, and often flicker from the contact's initial to the image saved for that contact while the list loads. This makes it hard to quickly scroll down the list of messages to find a conversation you want to add a message to (which is generally an easier way to find a contact in TextSecure than to search for a contact, I find on this device). Note the Rise is a piece of crap ;) and also one of the last slide-out keyboard phones out there, meaning there might be the mitigating factor of switching from portrait to landscape and the keyboard kicking in. This issue may have improved slightly with the latest release, but loading is still frustratingly slow.

		Since SMS encryption was disabled and while Google Play services, which I lack on my phone, is still a requirement for push messages, it seems that after the upgrade to newer version TextSecure works for me just as a fancy SMS/MMS messenger, without any extra functionality. That is a sad evolution of the product.

		After upgrade to latest TextSecure, I lost ability to add ASCII emoticons. Instead, in its place there is now a newline button. And far away there is now an emoticons button, but for icons, not ASCII. Enabling enter to send makes things even worse. Then there is a button &quot;Send&quot; instead of emoticons, but also the input box becomes one line. So very hard to read a longer message.

		Hi, When long pressing on the send button (in a chat with another TextSecure user) there is a menu popping up that should allow to send unsecure SMS. Nothing happens if I press on this Unsecure SMS menu item. The text just stays unsent in the edit field. (Sending SMS to non-TextSecure contacts works perfectly.) Found in build 2.25.3. Phone is Samsung Galaxy Note 4.

		Please add an option to disable this nag. I am only wanting to use TextSecure as an sms client, I have no interest in encrypting my messages and if I do so, I cannot send or receive those messages because I usually have no data. This is not the first time this has been requested: WhisperSystems#1891 WhisperSystems#1966 WhisperSystems#2734 Unfortunately, these threads are all closed so I cannot add my request to them... the explanation appears to be that encrypted standard sms support is going away, but I don't understand how this is an explanation for this request, isnt non-encrypted standard sms still to be available? It appears that all those thread writers are not interested in encrypted sms, but rather just plain sms, as am I, and as far as I can tell, this issue has not been addressed yet for us. Again, my reasons for using textsecure is not encryption, but rather that it has some nice features as an sms application, and is not as vulnerable to the stagefright bug.

At the bottom of each there are two buttons to download Signal-iOS, but there are no links to the Android apps.

		As I don't use TextSecure for sending or receiving SMS messages, I would like to be able to completely disable this functionality. In this way I won't be allowed to send unencrypted messages using TextSecure, not even by error. Currently if I long press the send button, or if I specify a phone number that is not using TextSecure, I am allowed to send a plain text SMS. Especially in the latter case it is not immediate to realize that this is happening. I think that the average user expects to disable any kind of SMS operation when setting &quot;SMS and MMS&quot; to Off. Thanks!

		Currently, if someone gets the ability to get my SMSes, such as by stealing my SIM card or somehow intercepting them at the carrier, or number cloning, then the only thing standing in the way of that person impersonating me to a user I've already chatted to is the key mismatch warning. Some users will click through that without thinking. And someone who's never chatted to me before will not get any warning because of TOFU. Since I don't think there's any intention to aggressively push users to manually verify key fingerprints, it would be nice if I could add a passphrase to my registration that would not let someone register a new device with my phone number without also having that passphrase. Since this adds some friction, it would be reasonable for it to be opt-in; that is to say, once I register my number for the first time, I should be able to go into the settings and enable the passphrase requirement. The biggest drawback I can see is that if I give up my phone number and then it is reassigned, someone else will be stuck unable to use textsecure with that number. I can't really think of a perfect way to solve this, but expiring a registration that hasn't been used at all in some period of time, say 12 months, would probably be a reasonable approach. Alternatively, instead of just requiring use, the server could periodically send the client a liveness check of some sort (via push), and clear the registration if those don't succeed for some shorter period of time (3 months?) if the app isn't even responding at all.

		I have a Nexus 6 with stock android 5.1.1, the problem is always reproducible. The steps are: Take a photo with the phone camera; Go to the Photos app, open the image and &quot;share it to TextSecure&quot;; TextSecure opens. Chose a recipient. The image appears in the conversation; Press &quot;send&quot;. The message disappears, nothing is sent. Here is the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/32aae2e2352b96d4bf40 The initial logged crash is probably not related to this, but to another issue that I'm going to report right after this.

		Well this is an interesting one. TS 2.25.3 on Android 2.3.4. I coaxed somebody into installing Signal and after some confusion about a verification code (I was getting texts that didn't tell me to send it to her, eventually we figured out that I should do that) she attempted to start a session with me. It failed. At that point, every other active textsecure session I have with every other contact is now completely broken. I get a &quot;failed to send&quot; both on regular messages and on attempts to end the secure session. The 'tap for details' UI just says &quot;failed to send&quot; in red, and the &quot;tap to resend&quot; button will fail again. With another TextSecure user in the same house, now he cannot send me messages (&quot;failed to send&quot;) or end a secure session with me. He also reports that it's asking him to verify my new identity key (?!). It appears to have persisted one reboot and I will try another.

		Use case: I and my contact are &quot;push registered&quot;, but at various times one of us goes offline for a few hours and would like to seamlessly switch to SMS. Explanation: I only use data when connected to WiFi, so SMS is prefered communication channel much of the time. This is common amongst my contacts here in Europe, but some have mobile data. Issue: TS seems to switch to PUSH whenever sender has data (or even if previous conversation was PUSH). This leads to frustrating undelivered messages if sender simply hits reply without deliberately forcing SMS. Feature request: When there is evidence that the sender or recipient is offline, there should be some way to prefer SMS. Two possible ways to avoid these undelivered PUSH replies: Seamless SMS fallback if either person is not online. If &quot;seamless&quot; is not an option: receiving an SMS should trigger SMS mode for the conversation. I understand that defaulting to SMS is problematic now that SMS encryption is gone, but this could be an &quot;Advanced&quot; option for nerds like me. Can add a warning as modal, or in settings: &quot;Warning: this could cost you money or accidentally lead to insecure SMS communication.&quot; Related: This behavior was outlined by @cramu here: WhisperSystems#984 (comment) If sender or recipient are not reachable (because mobile data is not available) a popup appears, warning the sender that the message could be delayed and asking him for confirmation or to edit his message and send via SMS/MMS. Issue #678 looked promising, but that bug is huge, stale and it is unclear what was finally decided upon / implemented.

		if the download arrow is shown for a pending download and you tap next to it (or above/below) you get the default &quot;View secure media&quot; dialog and with tapping yes you send an invalid intent to the viewer app QuickPic smoothly crashes in that case :) Same if the download is currently in progress and you tap anywhere on the media bubble!

		If an image download is pending there is only the download arrow (and maybe a text) but no indication (thumbnail) of what will be downloaded. For audio and video there are the specific built in icons/thumbnails. So maybe we should have that for images too. Alternative would be to have an ultra low resolution image that is sent with the message as thumbnail.

		When your contact's key changes and you try to scan their QR code through the &quot;You may wish to verify this contact&quot; link the keys won't match because the QR scan expects the old key even though the hex fingerprint screen shows the new key. Steps: Your contact's key changes They send you a message. You tap the message to open the &quot;The identifying material for contact has changed...&quot; dialog Tap the link &quot;You may wish to verify this contact.&quot; Notice that you see two fingerprints on this verification screen (and their fingerprint is the new one) Open the QR code scanning mode You either a) get a toast &quot;Recipient has no identity key!&quot; (in the case your contact has no previous key anymore - e.g. they unregistered at some point) OR b) Barcode Scanner opens, you scan their QR code, and you will get the dialog saying &quot;WARNING, the scanned key DOES NOT match! ...&quot; You can see the mismatch when you compare the fingerprint verification screen opened through the lock icon vs. the screen opened through the &quot;You may wish...&quot; link. As expected the former shows the old fingerprint and the latter shows the new one. However in the latter screen the QR code matching seems to still use the old key. Nexus 4, 5.1.1, TS 2.26.1 and before

		After enabling &quot;send sms with textsecure&quot; i tried to select a contact to send the sms to. Here i noticed that many contacts were appearing twice (or more even more often) which was not the case in the &quot;original&quot; contact app. They only appear twice in the &quot;all contacts&quot;-section, textsecure contacts are only once there. This appears to be related to the count of numbers attached to a contact - having the mobile number + that contact as whatsapp-contact with the same number has the contact appear twice (with the same number) - if that contact is also on facebook (or has 2 numbers) that contact appears 4 times. phone: oneplus one, stock 5.0.2 android (as delivered by oneplus), official textsecure app from the appstore (reinstalled today) (2.25.3).

		I have a contact who has two different numbers associated with his name. One is for SMS and the other is for push messages. When using the share dialog from any other app, textsecure shows me his name twice because I've had both push and SMS conversations with him recently. The share dialog does not tell me in any way what protocol will be used to send the message (SMS or textsecure). The conversation list screen also has a similar problem but the single/double check marks let me distinguish between SMS and push conversations after I open them. Version: TextSecure 2.26.1 on 4.4.4 Moto G (1st gen)

		My copy of TextSecure 2.6.4 started refusing to send plaintext SMS today. It turns out the build has &quot;expired&quot; for some value of &quot;expired&quot;. This was surprising and frustrating. I checked the mailing list, issues, and Google for any information about build expiration or the &quot;Your build of TextSecure has expired!&quot; message, but the only references I found were in the source code in this repo. Please either remove this expiration or warn about it weeks ahead of the actual date. And perhaps display the expiration date in the app's settings and/or document the expiration window online somewhere. Maybe in the repo's README or the Google Play description.

		Since yesterday afternoon all messages that we send in a group chat get an error. In german it says: &quot;Nicht zugestellt: für details antippen&quot;: &quot;not delivered click for details&quot;. But there is nothing in the details. Funny thing is that everyone confirms that they receive the messages but everyone has the error showing &quot;not delivered&quot; when sending a message. it's kinda annoying anyway. Let me know how I can help to debug that. kind regards Radi

		I often download an image in Chrome, send it via instant messenger and afterwards delete it. In TextSecure, the deleted images are still selectable after deletion. Immediately after deletion there is still a thumbnail visible. If I reboot my phone, the thumbnail is gone and I only see empty boxes: So does TextSecure use some kind of persistent cache here? In the log I get a stack trace: Device : motorola XT1032 (falcon_retde) Android : 5.0.2 (1, LXB22.46-28.1) Memory : 51M (0.05% used, 96M max) Memclass: 96 OS Host : ilclbld72 App : TextSecure 2.26.2 ws.com.google.android.mms.MmsException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: No such file or directory

		Currently you can only set the ringtone and vibration individually for each contact/thread. It would be very useful to be able to set the LED color so you can see at a glance who wrote, also it'd be useful to be able to set notification level (name, message, none) shown on an individual basis so I can see the messages eg my wife writes at a glance but business contacts are more confidential and only show the name.

		After latest update, there is no notification sent with TextSecure message. No sound alert, no number appearing to show me i have 1 unread message. It has been happening past few days, maybe a week. I have to open the app to see if there's something new. I have missed messages because I saw them too late. I almost missed out on Football today when a friend invited me last night and I never got alert. I had the thought to open the app this morning and luckily was able to respond in time. Serious issue ;) and yes I looked in Settings, Notifications is still set to On. (This was my first time in Settings, so I know I have not changed anything there myself)

		Would it be possible, if I start a message to a new phone number, to check whether that number can receive push messages and perform the handshake prior to the first message? I recently added a contact I knew would have TextSecure, so I was able to verify that this either isn't supported or isn't working. I have a suspicion that this might not easily work with the contact discovery mechanism, and if so, I can continue creating contacts before texting them.

		It seems like TextSecure does not ask for &quot;new&quot; messages when regaining internet connection after being in airplane mode or something similar. Is this assumption correct? Reproduce: Switch on airplane mode Make someone write you a message Switch off airplane mode --&gt; Notification for the new message won't get triggered Open TextSecure app --&gt; New message is displayed Expected: It should listen to the system event of regaining an internet connection and then automatically download new messages and notify about them.

		I know it's unimportant, but on textsecure I enjoyed having android emojis and don't like being forced to use apple's. It would be wonderful if we were allowed to choose, or if the app just used whatever the phone's default is. Thanks.

		When using the Dark theme, the main android status bar remains brightly colored and really draws attention to itself. Even worse - depending on conversation color, it can look really ugly. Can it just become darker like the rest of the app? Thanks!

		i usually leave data off on my phone, to conserve battery life. in the default message app, when i receive a text to multiple recipients, i have to turn data on to receive it, but i get a notification that it is there even with the data off. is that possible with text secure, for when messages come in? i'd really rather not have to have the data on just to know that there is a text message that someone sent me... thanks,

		The direct capture works very well, however I would like to suggest to either store the last status permanently or to have an option for the default (start with half or full screen mode). I do know, that options are not so welcome, that's why I propose the &quot;sticky&quot; mode.

		Just installed TextSecure (from Play store) for the first time send/receive all worked great and SMS import worked, but none of the MMS messages were imported. Sending/receiving them worked fine but I don't see any of the old group messages in TextSecure. Is this supported? Phone model: Verizon HTC One (HTC6500LVW) Android version: 5.0.2

		Hi. I'm going to join the club with picture related issues this week, and report that today at the university a picture downloaded indefinitely. I even tried restarting the app and it didn't help. It only worked when I restarted the phone. And yes, I killed the TS process. When I was trying to press download, but nothing happened: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f0115d3e50dc26e701f6 When it finally started &quot;downloading&quot;: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2b31b5988868c75115ee When it kept downloading with nothing happening: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67c7160595bbde0e758f What happened was this: I was on my mobile data at the university, and after pressing download I turned off mobile data and connected to WiFi. I could send messages just fine, and I could send other pictures, it's just that this one picture just didn't want to download.

		Could it be that TextSecure has problems with contacts stored via CardDAV on older Android devices? Since a couple of weeks (then on 2.25.3, now 2.26.5) I'm experiencing some problems. I have all my contacts stored via CalDAV, none on the SIM card and none on the phone (that runs on 4.2.2). Since a couple of weeks almost all TS-using contacts are shown twice in the list of TS users (and once under &quot;All contacts&quot;). Only newly added TS contacts are listed once. It started when I used TS 2.25.3. Today I noticed that one contact was listed (in the conversations list and in TS' contacts list) without her name, only by her number. Although the native contacts app shows a perfectly fine entry, when I tried to call that person, her name was not shown when dialing (as it would normally happen); instead her number was listed as an &quot;other&quot; number---in the native contacts app, her number is labeled &quot;mobile&quot;. In fact, when I tried to edit the contact in the native contacts app, at the bottom there is an entry for TextSecure (that cannot be edited) that indicates that the number is stored on the phone with the label &quot;other&quot;. (In turn, when I restrict the contacts to app to show contacts stored on the phone only, it lists none, as I would expect.) Does that imply that TS creates a local copy of the CardDAV phone number on the phone? In fact, said contact is one the many duplicates. I played around and &quot;separated&quot; and re-&quot;joined&quot; the varying accounts via which I'm connected to said person in the native contacts app. Now her name (instead of her number only) is listed twice again in the list of TS users, but the two entries are not listed in two subsequent rows, but the first entry jumped to the very top of the list, before the names starting with an A. I repeated that exercise with another duplicate entry, to the same effect: it seems that a second list of TS users is created that is alphabetically ordered and stacked on top of the other one. Apologies for this lengthy post. The only previous issue I found that mentions CardDAV is WhisperSystems#2533, which &quot;solved&quot; itself when the user updated to a higher Android version.

		With enabled system emoji, the shortcut to the emoji selection in the bottom left corner is removed. My keyboards (Swype and Google Keyboard) show an emoji button instead the normal enter button, which I used for line breaks. This is not possible anymore with enabled system emoji. Please don't change the behavior of the layout with enabled system emoji, it's just irritating.

		I recently had to change my phone number and used the recommended protocol from the support pages to do so: http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/articles/1468975 After reenabling push messages everything worked fine on my side, but most of my contacts only received an error instead of my messages (Message encrypted for non-existant session). After they sent a message to me this problem was resolved. I guess a new session was opened by that? Furthermore my old number did still show up in all of my group conversations and broke them for everybody (Error sending message). As I can't reactivate my old number, our only option was to create new groups. My first attempt to do so was also unsuccessful because of the session errors mentioned above. Half of the members still had their old session with me and only received notification about an &quot;unknown group&quot; in which they could not read or write. I'm not familiar with the specifics of how Textsecure handles sessions or group conversations, so all I can do is report this strange behaviour and hope for some smart people to figure out what went wrong here.

		Someone sent me a large video of about 32 MB size that was downloaded to TextSecure. When I click the attachment icon in the conversation, TextSecure asks me if I want to view secure media. I confirm with YES and am asked which app should be used for the action. I select Google Video Player and from now on it hangs. I have to kill Galerie to stop the hanging app. When I save the attachment to the sdcard I can open it without any problem. Only directly opening from TextSecure does not work. TS 2.27.1 on Android 4.4.4 cyanogenmod on Galaxy S2

		There are some bugs in group conversations when following these steps. Two parties, ＃1 and ＃2 ＃1 disables Textsecure-messages in settings ＃2 creates a group conversation and invites ＃1 ＃1 enables Textsecure-messages in settings ＃2 sends a message in the group conversation This scenario resulted in four found bugs The first message that is sent by ＃2 in step 4 is not received by ＃1. When a message is successfully transmitted, the group thread appears in ＃1 chat list. But it doesn't have the selected thread name. It uses Unnamed group. Pressing the &quot;show members&quot; icon will not display any members. (Major problem) ＃1 can't open the keyboard. Pressing the emoji icon will open the emoji drawer but it is not possible to press send. Attaching a file is also possible, but it is not possible to press end. Device info: Samsung Galaxy S5. Android 5.0. Textsecure 2.26.2. Sony Z3 Compact. Android 5.1.1. Textsecure 2.25.3. App state: Push registered. Enable/Disable Textsecure-messages. Log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f47acfb7b705db94e712 Related issues: WhisperSystems/TextSecure-Browser#274 I am investigating what causes this problem. Would appreciate any comments/advice, specially on the 4th bug.

		Device Model: MotoG Android Version: 5.1.1 (CyanogenMod 12.1.20150820-NIGHTLY) TextSecure Version: 2.26.5 Situation: PersonA and PersonB both use TextSecure. PersonA uses TextSecure as their default SMS application. PersonB does not use TextSecure as their default SMS application. PersonB does not always have a network connection and will at times send SMS messages to PersonA. Expected Behaviour: SMS messages sent from PersonB to PersonA will be shown as green in TextSecure. Current Behaviour: SMS messages sent from PersonB to PersonA are shown in blue. Problems Caused: PersonA does not know if the message sent from PersonB was sent securely. PersonA may assume PersonB has connectivity due to them sending messages, and thus wrongly assume their messages have been received. PersonA may not know over which medium (SMS/TextSecure) they are expected to reply to PersonB.

		Fresh install, tested on GB: Start a new conversation. Send a text message 'hi' Send a text message 'hihi' Send a text message 'hihihi' Quick capture an image and send. Attach an audio file and send. Attach a 13 second video and send. Scroll up. The conversation list should display (from top to bottom): hi, hihi, hihihi, image thumbnail, audio icon, video icon. Instead it displays: image thumbnail, audio icon, video icon, image thumbnail (same as first), audio icon, video icon. Was able to reproduce from fresh install twice in a row, so should be fairly reproducible.

		It does not seem possible to delete drafts (at least I'm not able to find any possibility to do so). If the possibility exists a pointer how to do it would be welcome, otherwise this would be a very useful feature since it's not uncommon to start a message which becomes obsolete shortly after. A quick way to get rid of the obsolete draft would increase usability considerably.

		Right now you get the full screen incoming call activity. If you then (accidentally) switch the app or go to home screen, it's still ringing and you have to tap the notification &quot;Signal call in progress&quot;, that brings you back to the call activity. There should be the buttons &quot;Dismiss&quot; and &quot;Answer&quot; on the notification.

		The prequisite would be including barcode scanner into TextSecure/Signal and to move the &quot;end secure session&quot; to the three dot menu. Tapping the lock would enable QR code verification immediately. When Axolotl protocol assigns Alice and Bob roles to devices by comparing the base key, they could also be used assign roles for QR-code verification: e.g. display QR code on Alice's device and open camera on Bob's device. Bob could then scan both fingerprints from Alice's device at the same time: It could both verify that Bob's device had received the proper key from Alice, and that the proper key was delivered to Alice's device. After verification, Bob's device would either report successful verification or MITM risk. Here's a mockup I made: This approach would reduce the amount of user interaction from nine taps to two, and after crude measuring, verification would be 20 seconds faster.

			<description>
		I recently switched to a new android phone. I installed textsecure from scratch (same phone number) and everything except for groups is fine again. The first thing I noticed: I can't see the groups I'm in, so I can't send messages to these groups. But the more annoying bug is the following: I received a message from a group I'm in. I can read it and I see who wrote it. BUT: I can't respond. When I touch the field for text input nothing happens. The name is simply &quot;Unnamed group&quot;. I can't see the group members.

		I'm not sure if this is a bug or a question. Shouldn't Signal on Android use the same icon as Signal on iOS (and the browser extension)? Or should the iOS version use this icon instead? Either way consistency isn't being respected.

		Updated to Signal 3.0.0 Whether I open a conversation with a contact who has redphone or a contact who has Signal on iOS I am not allowed to call securely. The phone icon in the top right corner doesn't have the lock -- but I remember seeing it while testing the app I built myself. I have refreshed the push directory several times, both using wifi and mobile data. Clicking the phone icon opens the usual dialling app. From here, calling doesn't prompt any &quot;call securely with Signal&quot; either. Android 4.1.2

		I have around 5 other Signal users in my contact list (all IOS). I can't call them with Signal due to lack of an option to do so. When clicking the telephone Icon only thing to come up is the mobile call. Android 4.4 CM 11. Device FP1. Signal 3.0.1

		Device info: OnePlus One, Cyanogenmod 5.1.1 / 12.1, TextSecure 2.28.1 App state: Push registered, SMS enabled I used adb logcat to capture a crash when opening TextSecure: https://gist.github.com/derpston/7f5d722a1f76d5f92116 If I disconnect the phone from the internet using airplane mode, I can open TextSecure. When I turn on wifi or 3g, TextSecure crashes as soon as it is able to make a connection. Here's a log from when that happens: https://gist.github.com/derpston/54ec33c1c8c02b65b44b The relevant stack trace seems to be: W/AttachmentDownloadJob(10673): Downloading push part (row id: 1381, unique ID: 1443374570637)
W/JobConsumer(10673): java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException: -20

		Using Signal 3.0.1 (beta) for Android on a Nexus 5. Debug log (though I doubt you'll want it) is https://gist.github.com/526f0bbf1de80801e008 On WhatsApp, when I attach a contact, it brings up the contact's record with checkboxes next to each item of information that you have for him/her (e.g. numbers and email addresses) and you can choose which you want to include. You then click send and it sends them all together as a record, formatted specially. Clicking on it in the WhatsApp chat then allows you to add that information to your contacts (giving you the option to add it to an existing contact, or create a new contact, as is normal for receiving a contact). It also has a clever little message icon under the contact record that allows you to send a WhatsApp message to that contact straight away without adding them to your address book. The interface in Signal is much less developed. When you select attaching contact information on the same contact, it only shows me the phone numbers for the contact (rather than the email addresses) and selecting one just inserts the number alone (with no name or formatting). I would like to see Signal send a proper contact record with a similar flow to that described above for WhatsApp, at least if the recipient is also a Signal/TextSecure user and the message is being sent over the data channel.

		Not sure if this is really a bug or my device and ROM just suck but I will report anyway. The microphone of my Huawei U8800 does not seem to work with Signal. After establishing the call the other party does not hear anything. I've gone through all the system settings and there's nothing that should prevent the microphone from working. It works with regular calls. And it sort of works with Google Hangouts calls (there's static noise but the voice goes through). But for Signal there's no sound at all. I don't know if RedPhone works. I tried to install it and register but the voice verification I received was silent so I couldn't test with it. As this Huawei is my test device and it has cheap, outdated hardware with a weird, outdated and rooted ROM I don't mind if this will ever work. But in the case that this is a Signal bug and it concerns other devices too here's a log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cad04e7a57887989ee08 There are a lot of these in there: E/AudioHardwareMSM7X30(  115): AudioStreamInVoip::read : device is already open

		I was conversing with a friend who uses Signal. We typically use regular SMS, as my friend is accustomed to using iMessage by default. On occasion, we converse via encrypted messaging. So on my end, my conversation thread is a mix of SMS and encrypted messages. This is the case with a few other friends as well Today we were conversing via SMS, and my friend sent an MMS, which was likely just a picture of what we were talking about. I tapped on the MMS to download it, and TS immediately crashed I opened TS again and entered my passphrase, and it immediately crashed. This continued to happen, over and over. The app has become unusable I still receive SMS and encrypted messages, and notifications. If I enter my passphrase, TS will crash, but I can then see message previews in the pull down notification window. I can even use the &quot;Mark All As Read&quot; option Rebooting my phone hasn't helped. I asked a few other friends to message me via TS, and to send TS messages and MMS' with picture attachments, in hopes that some state of the app would change. Nothing has worked I'm on the latest version of Android and TS My debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/98234d272af3935fe776 Thank you

		I tested and found that a &quot;direct capture&quot; (image only, no text) which I sent to someone cannot be resent, or copied/pasted into a new message. The only way is to decrypt/save into a file, and then to compose a new TS with that image as attachment. If my observation is correct - that a &quot;direct capture&quot; cannot be copied, or resent, for technical reason, --&gt; then I suggest to disable those context menu items (long-click onto d-c-message) which are not available in that case (do not show the copy/paste item, do not show the resend function, but show the save-to-file icon for a direct capture message).

		The unregister option in advanced settings has a description: &quot;Free private messaging and calling to Signal users&quot; which conflicts with the subsequent dialogs, e.g.: &quot;This will disable Signal messages by unregistering you from the server. You will need to re-register your phone number to use Signal messages again in the future.&quot; I.e. the former talks about messages and calls while the latter talks only about messages. Affected strings: preferences__use_the_data_channel_for_communication_with_other_signal_users

		Colors per contact is a nice feature but I would prefer to have a default color for each contact until I want to customize. The reason is that most colors look quite aggressive and I would prefer to have the system theme applied instead (which is softer for the eyes). Could you foresee an option/default behavior where all chats have the system theme and contact color customization remains available in individual conversion settings? 👍 1

		I use TextSecure and my friend has an iPhone that at one point had Signal installed (she didn't want to use it for some reason). Now TextSecure keeps defaulting to sending her encrypted SMSs even though she doesn't have Signal installed anymore. So I'll send her texts and get no reply, not always realizing they were all encrypted and she didn't get any of them. Then I have to copy them, hold down the button to switch to unencrypted, and resend them all.

		A friend of mine tried to unregister from TextSecure temporarily to fix some messaging issues. However, TS crashed after removing the checkmark from &quot;enable textsecure messages&quot;. After a restart, TS messages were enabled again. He can still send me encrypted messages, but I have to fall back to SMS since I am told that he doesn't use TS anymore.

		I'm not familiar with the redphone internals, so correct me if I misunderstood something... I have two devices running Signal 3.0.2. They were exchanging messages and where having some calls. Now device A reinstalled Signal (resulting in a new identity key) and called device B. The call was established without problems, no warning was given. Writing a message from A to B lead to a warning (&quot;Receives message with unknown identity key...&quot;). Shouldn't be there a warning during the call as well? This allows to impersonate someone else, no?

		The available colors for conversations have changed somewhere in the 2.26 or 2.27 range I believe, brown is no longer available. However, I have a few conversations which I gave that color and it remains working. In recipient_preferences it has still &quot;brown&quot; in the color field, although I can't select it anywhere. When I manually edit an color field to &quot;brown&quot;, FC Signal and then restart it the conversation gets that color too. Is this the intended behaviour or should there be some change in the UI about this?

		I found the following issue in Signal for Android build 3.0.2 with Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Steps to reproduce: Switch your phone into off-line (flight) mode Try to secure-call a contact Immediately press the red hang-up button to cancel the call Now again try to secure-call that contact You will get the following dialing screen with UNKOWN name, number and picture. If you repeat dial, hang-up, dial, hang-up multiple times, Signal crashes. It looks like the bad (UNKNOWN) dialing screen always first appears with the second call attempt.

		Going over the paper How Secure is TextSecure? I saw that the authors both describe a so-called UKS attack and state having had discussions with @moxie0 and others. I was, however, not able to find any specifics on whether this has been addressed in TextSecure, so I would like to ask if it was.

Required by: :TextSecure-master:unspecified Is it possible there's been a version change again and/or this version has been removed from the maven repositories? (Trying to understand the problem I went to afollestad's page and saw him mentioning another maven repository, but maybe that's just for the version 0.8.2.0.) If that's not the problem I'll try to keep on battling Android Studio and my laptop to get them loading TextSecure properly.

		Two of my contacts are reporting (both on 2.28.1 with different phones) to only see messages from me after opening TextSecure. Messages had been sent for hours. No prior system notification. They were also displayed to me as sent, not received as well (with only one checkmark). As I'm the only TS contact they have, I can't say if this only affects messages sent from me or others as well. Log from one of my contacts (FP1 1.8.2 on Android 4.2.2) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/504c0c3ebb3668879e2a if it's any good, I can get a debug log from the other device as well.

		Samsung SGH-T399 Android 4.2.2 Signal 3.0.3 When Upgrading to Signal via the beta channel, the TextSecure icon on my Android home screen doesn't update. It does, however, update to signal in the list of installed apps. So I have to make a new signal shortcut, and delete the old shorcut (which still opens the app). See image: I'm unsure if this is just a buggy version of android, or if there is a way to force the icon to refresh from within our code.

		With a recent version (I'm currently on 3.0.3) Signal is &quot;greyed out&quot; in the Pebble app. I have not updated the Pebble app in a while which leads me to believe this has to be related to a change in Signal. Did you do anything that prevents third-party apps from accessing the notifications of Signal? Would you consider reverting or making said protection optional?

		I use Signal 3.0.3 on Android. I tried to call an iPhone with Signal 2.1.3, but I saw only the option to send encrypted messages, calling showed the default system dialer. The iPhone has Signal installed for several weeks now so I assumed the numbers had been synced by now. When synced by hand, pulling down in the contact list, the option to call appeared. Perhaps the automatic syc does not yet sync the encrypted call option? Edit: had the same results from another phone and a tablet. The phones run both Android 4.4, the tablet 4.0.3.

		This morning I tried to establish a couple of secure calls between two Android Signal phones. Only the first time everything worked fine; however, thereafter everytime, after having successfully established a connection, my phone would not transmit anything I said nor would I hear anything my friend said. It's as if my phone was dead, even though the app indicates are normally functioning call. I adjusted my phone's volume during such calls, it doesn't seem like the volume had been set to zero or something. A couple of times the connection would sort of disappear with both phones stating in the top bar that a phone call to an unknown recipient was active (clicking on that notification gave a screen identical to the one depicted in WhisperSystems#4234.) In the most recent attemts to call my friend her phone wouldn't even ring anymore In case someone found the time to have a look, here are the logs. My phone (Signal 3.0.3, Android 4.2.2): https://gist.github.com/4ed595aa929def90900a and (most recently with the failed call initialization) https://gist.github.com/a2ac6019b5f7ec93c826 Other phone (Signal 3.0.3, Android 4.1.2): https://gist.github.com/7bc9ccc7422fa9709896

		TextSecure won't work without Google Play or the underlying Google Play services. I think this is a bad situation: IMHO the secure open-source messenger app, with strong open crypto relies on a proprietary (right? It's not open source, or is it?) library from a US based company. If the whatsapp client uses the TS-protocol, why should I use TS? There are quite some gappless phones and honestly, it is either Gapps and TS or no Gapps and no Messenger-App at his point. :) Also compare for #725.

		When I recieve a group MMS but use broadcast mode to reply two problems occur: Even though my answer is plaintext only and sent to each recipient individually it still seems to get sent as MMS instead of SMS. This doesn't only increase costs but can also be an issue with some people not being able to read the message. I message is sent to myself as well. It would also be nice to have an option to reply only to the sender of the original message.

		I'm using Signal 3.0.3 and have been using it for awhile now. I'm not seeing Redphone users as &quot;signal-callable&quot; users: no phone with lock, just a plain phone icon. I am able to text them securely just fine though. I DO however see my lone iPhone Signal user as a callable contact. I then got together with a friend using 2.28.1 and Redphone. From their Redphone contact list I'm still registered there and called my phone from there and I received it inside of Signal and was able to talk. I have of course pulled to refresh numerous times and even re-registered Redphone on my friend's phone thinking maybe that would alert something as to being callable.

		The following has happened for the first time, after many months of TS working flawlessly on this phone: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/723ba29a67dcafdd3664 I sent a plain SMS message as expected (and done many times before) with TS. It was received by the adressee. Hours later, I found the GSM network &quot;unavailable&quot; (supposedly due to GSM hiccup, as the phone wasn't moved nor touched). I enabled, then re-disabled flight mode in order to cleanly reconnect to the tower. As soon as this happened, I was briefly notified that TS had troubles sending a message, and TS apparently started to flood the send queue with hundreds of resending attempts. Unfortunately, many (if not all) succeeded, giving the stunned recipient a massive SMS flood / DOS experience. There was a system popup dialog asking if I wanted to allow TS to send the high number of SMS messages it tried to, but the phone (S5, normally very fast and slick ROM) was so busy sending and playing sound alerts that dialog didn't seem to care about my answer (or was immediately replaced by a new instance, I don't know). I shut off the phone and restarted, but as soon as GSM was connected, the mess continued. Alas, I did not manage to capture any logs. When the phone finally got reponsive again, they appeared empty (I looked with System Tuner Pro).

		Found this while trying out current master. Here are two screen shots of the same section of a long group conversation. An image from a different thread is shown, tapping on it also opens the wrong image. Notice how the rounded corners somehow fail to render: after leaving and re-entering the conversation, the correct image appears: Log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7b6d0aeaf5788f2239b9 Edit: I can reproduce this systematically by scrolling through a long conversation really fast. The picture that is shown instead of the correct one is always the most recent picture attachment of all conversations.

		In ae97495, a limited number of messages are loaded and displayed in a conversation, with an affordance labeled &quot;Load full conversation&quot; (load_more_header__load_full_conversation) provided to load and display the rest. &quot;Load&quot; is a technical, implementation-detail-ish term which the user doesn't need to know. Platform apps use &quot;view&quot; or &quot;show&quot; in cases like this to clearly state to the everyday user the direct benefit of activating the affordance: View full conversation Show full conversation View all messages Show all messages

		If you receive an MMS that fails to download, the &quot;tap for details&quot; hanger on the bottom of the message actually shows up on the right side of the conversation row, instead of under the bubble on the left side. When you tap it, it then shows a message details activity with a &quot;resend&quot; button, even though this is a received message. Been this way for a while.

		Sometimes, when I'm using Signal to speak with someone, the call will drop unexpectedly. While I expect this to happen sometimes, right now Signal doesn't provide any indication that it has happened (other than the fact it's no longer running). It would be nice if, before shutting down, it played some tone to make it more obvious. 👍 2

		My friend is in a timezone 1h ahead of mine. When they send me a message, TS shows the time as one hour ahead of the current local time. There are two problems with this: It is confusing for the user when following the conversation / reading the message. The conversation list shows the conversation as 23h in the past, sorted below a conversation that was only a few &quot;proper&quot; hours in the past. Possible reason for the time difference: My friend did not set the timezone, but the time, when traveling to their current location. Thus our timezones are the same, but their time is wrong. I did not ask them to confirm that, yet. What I would expect from TS: When a conversation is in the future, show it above all others (sorted by relative/signed time difference), instead of sorting it by absolute/unsigned time difference. The server could append its own time, so that the receiving client has three times: sent-by-sender, received-by-server, received-by-recipient. Then: TS could show all three times in the message details. In the conversation view, it could show the time that (roughly) agrees with the others, filtering the third from the user's view by default. E.g. show an average of the two (of all three) times with the least difference.

		Hi, I am running updated textsecure on an HTC One M7 with Android 5.0.2. Yesterday, a friend with Signal on iOS tried to send me a picture. I have received messages and pictures from that person just fine before. But I got the &quot;incoming MMS failed&quot; instead of the actual picture. When I clicked on the &quot;resend&quot; link to the right of the message, it crashed the app. I then tried to re-open the app, but it immediately crashed and then gave the &quot;Unfortunately, TextSecure has stopped&quot; pop-up, and that pop-up comes up twice. I have tried restarting and powering off/on my phone, but still can't open TextSecure and get the same error message twice. The strange thing though is that I can see my new messages (from a different Signal user) that have come in by swiping down on the notification banner. But I can't reply because that would require actually opening the app, which isn't happening. I don't know how to send a log, but if this is something you can look into, please respond and I'll try to work with you on it. Thank you!

		Hi. Sending a media message using data randomly fails for me. It works 9/10 times, but 1/10 times it fails. I'm at home with a stable WiFi connection. This has happened for the last 2-3 beta releases from what I can remember. Typically when it happens I'm just writing to someone, then I send a picture and it fails after a second. I then retry and it works right away. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0ca64a7e5009968a8cc3 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c8e46db6b402fb06171d

		Me (A) and two other persons (B,C) are using TextSecure (the current version 2.28.1) for several months to communicate via encrypted messages (showing the lock icon). Another person (D) has just got Signal freshly installed and registered (on iOS 8.4.1). She has got the phone numbers of A,B,C in her contacts (but strangely her Signal contact list shows A and B, not C). When A now sends a message to D, it shows the lock, and D can answer via Signal. However, we did not manage to send encrypted messages from B or C to D, and from D to B or C: B's and C's TextSecure always falls back to 'unsafe SMS', and D's Signal does not even offer to send a message to B or C. It seems that D's Signal did not find out that B and C are registered TextSecure users. I have put a protocol of B at https://gist.github.com/77a449110e97b2aecf39, and one of D at https://gist.github.com/ff7d002f0eb2f0d27883.

		Hi, one issue that comes up frequently when I make TextSecure/Signal calls with extended family is uncomfortable fingerprint-verification word choices. For example, today I had to explain to my parents why the words &quot;retouch puberty&quot; came up on their phone. Some other possibilities that will probably happen to people at some point: &quot;newborn puberty&quot; &quot;showgirl penetrate&quot; &quot;facial escapade&quot; &quot;adult visitor&quot; 95% of the time it doesn't matter at all, but if it were possible, I'd prefer that the word combinations be extremely boring. I want to be able to recommend Signal to anyone without worrying about whether they'll get weird words and end up being creeped out. I'd be happy to go through and change the words in src/org/thoughtcrime/redphone/crypto/zrtp/SASCalculator.java, but I think there may be some additional work to do around versioning. Is changing this list possible / realistic? If you all think this should be changed too, I'm happy to help... I was building TS from source for a while but stopped a few months ago. I don't mind getting everything set up again if it means this will get changed.

The only what I can hear is a piece of word &quot;Hallo&quot;. I did run Wireshark and it looks that after around 500ms all UDP packages have the same length 72 bytes (from the package 55). Before length was jumping from the 28 till 164 bytes. Assuming payload is &quot;0&quot;. If you check logs, the call start from the line 4576 --&gt; https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a0f9b5a517dbadac4b8a#file-cat-log-L4576 Traces https://www.dropbox.com/s/0anbpmi5sbtwysn/TC_call_v311.pcap?dl=0 Samsung GT-I9305 + CyanogenMod 11, Android 4.4.4.

		I have had 2 verification calls, much later than I pressed the button requesting them. Each time I got the call I was already using a different app, and had no place to put the code. So now I have to leave the app open and wait. A manual place to enter the code would be super.

		When sending a picture, the conversation scrolls so that the bottom of the picture is at the bottom of the screen. If you have included text as part of the picture message and send it, the text will not show until you scroll further. I would expect the text to show as well. Thanks again guys for the awesome software. Signal 3.1.1

		Hi, my mom is clumsy and calls me by accident fairly regularly. Every damn time it rings for me, so I answer. Then I'm always stuck at &quot;Connecting&quot;. Regardless of how long I wait it never goes away, because there is no one to connect to. In my opinion, for starters, there should be a sound indicating connecting. You know when you make a real call, it makes a beep occasionally while connecting you? Signal could totally use that to make this less confusing. Second and more importantly, I think Signal should send a message to the server or whatever indicating the call was cancelled, to prevent me from sitting there waiting for a call that is never going to connect. How to reproduce Person A calls person B Person A hangs up a second or so after pressing the call button Person B answers the call Person B sits around and waits, wondering why he can't connect to grandma Person B gets irritated and manually aborts the call.

		When I try to initiate a new call I immediately get an error &quot;Anmeldung fehlgeschlagen!&quot; (RedPhone_login_failed). This is on a OnePlus 2 with latest Oxygen version. The phone seems to have some issues regarding not knowing if it wants 32 or 64 bit. I had that with another app (https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn) where it tried to use the 32 bit libs instead of the 64 bit ones. I don't know how this was fixed though. This is just an estimated guess, if I can help with debugging, let me know (but you have to tell me how).

		So, I had an Experia Z1 months back. I tried TextSecure over a year ago and thought it was OK, but I didn't really commit and so removed it. Factory-erased it a couple months back and sold it, bought a Galaxy S6. Didn't install Signal at all. When I look in the play store, it says it's installed. Doesn't say where tho. I'm allowed to install it and it offers my Galaxy. The Experia no longer shows in my devices as of course I removed it. To be clear - Signal is absolutely NOT installed on my Galaxy and never has been. He texted me yesterday via signal and it said it was delivered securely. I didn't receive it (of course, I don't have Signal). So I texted him a normal SMS today and it came up on his device with the little padlock. How is this? I can't possibly have sent him a secure message, and where are his messages to me going? When he goes to message me, it says &quot;Send Signal message&quot;, which would have led him to believe it was encrypted and being sent to me. I've kept my same mobile number, and the buyer of my experia didn't get any old sim cards or anything. So, ummm... bug?

		This has been around awhile. If I attach an image to a message in 3.1.1, the preview shows the correct HxW ratio (say 16:9) but after I send it, it only shows a clipped square (1:1 HxW ratio) and actually doesn't let me see the whole picture in the thread. If I open the picture it does show the whole picture correctly.

		At least some users in Mexico are having difficulty registering with Signal. As far as I've heard, this is an ongoing problem that also affected TextSecure. The symptoms I've seen are that 1) SMS registration does not work - the registration times out unsuccessfully. 2) The user can successfully register using voice verification, and an encrypted session can be initialized, and messages sent back and forth. 3) However, the Mexican phone then decides that it is no longer registered, and encrypted messages cannot be sent or received. I suspect this issue may be related to #3360 - there are multiple valid formats for a Mexican phone number. I've posted a debug log.

		With the latest strings added to the Signal-Android project on Transifex there is no way for me to correctly translate some of them to my language (Slovenian): SEND TO %1$s FRIEND(S) Send %1$s SMS invite(s)? Due to differencies between languages I can't use () keys in the cases above and if I don't use them Transifex doesn't let me save my translations. I suggest you solve these issues the same way as you did with #2421, without using () keys.

		A friend is an iPhone user and installed Signal a longer time ago I am being told &quot;[said friend] is on Signal, say hey!&quot; every ~20s In his chat, I can only send &quot;unsecured SMS&quot;. Signal messages or Signal calls are not available SMS transmission fails Force closing the app does not change anything. I will still receive a notification every few seconds. If I try to start a new conversation with him, it has the header &quot;Take your conversation with [said friend] to the next level. Invite to Signal&quot;. Deleting the last active Signal chat with him did not have any effect. I am still getting a notification every few seconds. My device: Stock Nexus 5 Android 6.0, Signal 3.3.0, all permissions are allowed. The screenshot shows that I have a screen filter active (rootless CF.Lumen) and a custom set DPI. Both should not provoke this behaviour. App state: Push registered, set as SMS application debug log

		So a friend of mine recently changed their sim card and thus got a new phone number. In the normal Signal chat session pane it will show the person's name with their phone number below it. However, this number has stayed the same when I view my chat with this person. I actually had no idea this person had changed their sim/number until a few weeks later, even though I was frequently messaging them via Signal. After they told me I then added their number to my contacts list (so now both the new and old numbers are listed under their name in my phone's contacts list). However, the Signal chat pane still shows the old number. I should point out that this in no way affects functionality of the app, it's purely the aesthetical display of the phone number under their name. If this is due to the fact I still have the old number saved, I cannot remove that as that friend still swaps between the 2 sims on rare occasions.

		Reproducible like that: A and B are having a normal Signal conversation A gets a new phone and registers for Signal again -&gt; new key A is creating a new group with B A is writing a message in that group B is receiving 2 key exchange messages in the existing/normal conversation with A (group creation + message) B is accepting the new key in one of them: the message appears in the existing conversation and the group is created without this message

		Hello As @moxie0 stated here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10498671 he would be pleased to see a 'API-compatible open source implementation of play services' to make it possible to use signal with GMS without the need to install GAPPS. Well, there is now good progress in this direction with the project microG GmsCore. This aims to be a 'framework to allow applications designed for Google Play Services to run on systems, where Play Services is not available'. Would it be possible to accept this as an alternative? At the moment this project can be used to run Signal without GAPPS. The disadvantage is that microg GmsCore needs to fake app signatures at the moment to get Signal running. This is a huge security risk. If Signal would accept microg GmsCore as an alternative to the proprietary implementation, there would be no need anymore to tamper with the android security system. What do you Signal developers think about this and would you consider this as an alternative? Kind regards. PS: I am not affiliated with this project. More can be found here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-microg-gmscore-floss-play-services-t3217616 https://github.com/microg

		V 3.3 Sony Z1 compact 5.1.1 Whenever I enter a convo a try to quick capture I get scared a little bit of what I see. The happy me. 😊 So the front cam is the default for me. In-convo the change to back is stored though between closing and opening the quick capture. Until reentering. Stock and 3rd party cam behave well and default to back. Log after entering convo and opening quick capture (front mode of course) https://gist.github.com/4a9f0c1fd53547db82ca You dropped some log outputs, did you?

		yesss, twichty fingers is around again open convo open quick capture rapidly change between compose field and quick capture bang! log after cam crash: ( https://gist.github.com/008f8f0b57c9236cff0a ) Wanted to reproduce the case where cam and keyboard are on screen the same time which I encountered a few minutes ago in 3.3 (sounds familiar...) In case I got the mentioned behavior, which somehow is new ;) Edit: to few log outputs, it feels to me. Edit 2: maybe it crashes cause of what the camera sees on the front cam 😂

		When the keyboard is open and you open the new (and really nice) attachment drawer, you can still see the keyboard peeking through. I think it would look much better if the attachment drawer had the size of the keyboard, or the keyboard gets closed before. I don't have this problem with the emoji drawer, the behaviour there is perfect! Nexus 4, 5.1.1 HTC Desire, 2.3.7

		I guess this is somehow related to #4029, but that one seems to be fixed - while I'm still experiencing that kind of issue. Almost all of my contacts appear a couple of times in Signal's contact list - with all of their different phone numbers. So far, so good (expected behaviour). But many have additional duplicate entries with the same number (it's always a mobile number) listed twice. One of them has the format +12 345 67890 (which is exactly how I format all of my phone book's entries). The other one (the duplicate) has the very same number, but formatted as +1234567890 (a format not to be found in my phone book). I've noticed that - as far as I looked - each of the contacts with this kind of duplicate has an WhatsApp entry in Android's phone book (actually 2 entries - one for calls and one for messages). Interestingly, though, the WhatsApp entries in Android's phone book are also (sort of correctly) formatted as +12 345 67890. I don't necessarily say that the WhatsApp entries are the culprit (i. e. they confuse Signal). But it surely looks like they are. It has been like this for a long time, but I just took the time to inspect this more closely. I'm using vanilla Android 6 on a Nexus 5 with Signal 3.3.0.

		I see that with 8fd0ea3 the quick picture mode uses the front facing camera by default. I personally don't like it, but if you think that for most people it's more &quot;useful&quot; like this, then fine. I suggest to make Signal remember the last used camera (either per-conversation or application-wide). This would make most people happy and I think it fits within your development guidelines (don't add settings, ...).

		Signal 3.3.0, other side the latest iOS version. Yesterday I received a Signal call. While calling (on speaker) I received a (little bit) delayed Signal message from the same person. I pulled down the notification drawer to see tghe message and got in the standard Signal messages screen. When I pushed the back button I more or less expected to re-enter the call screen but I got in the list of conversations. Is that intended? When I re-opened the conversation with the person who was calling (we could continue to talk during this) and pushed the call button I re-entered the Redphone call screen.

		If I only add one person or confirm the group configuration without any changes all participants are listed as joined and the unchanged group name is listed as new group name. Found in build 3.3.1. For me it looks like a regression that has possibly been introduced with the fix that replaces numbers with names for joined participants.

		I've noticed that many wiki pages need an update and/or are missing. For examle the 'redphone protocol' page is not reachable since the github repo was taken down. Another thing i noticed is the protocol is still called textsecure protocol v2. Since this is the only protocol signal has ever supported i suggest we just call it the signal protocol. (this is kind of off topic but is why I was looking for the wiki page: how much is shared between the messaging and calling protocols? Is the calling protocol zrtp as claimed here? If this is true it means it does not have the self healing properties of the axolotl ratchet, right?)

		I have friends who always want to mute certain groups. Currently, it's only possible to mute groups one week at a time, which can get really cumbersome. I'd be convenient for them to have the option to mute these groups for a really long time. Is there any rationale not to extend the muting options with longer periods, like &quot;1 year&quot; or &quot;forever&quot; (9999 years)?

		You probably know of things like charities using numbers such as 85474 (made up number) to donate. Attempting to send a text to such a number from Signal results in the country code being added, so from where I live, it became +4485474 and thus failed.

		Hello. I wish there was a way of telling who has Signal and who hasn't immediately by looking at the contact's name on the &quot;front page&quot; of Signal. It would only take a tiny lock next to their name. As it is right now, there is no way of teling if a user has Signal or not, unless you click their name. It's not a big deal, I know. But if the long term goal of Signal is to compete with WhatsApp I would say this feature is a necessity. Sorry for a dizzy post, I've had the flu for quite some time now.

		Since commit 5757962 was added, you can now install Signal on WiFi-only devices like tablets. However, if you do this, and register using the same phone number as your phone with a Signal install, your phone will no longer be able to receive or send Signal messages (and vice versa). The obvious solution is better multi-device support, which is already on the roadmap. But until then, there should be some warning that you can only have one device per number right now.

		I think it's highly non-obvious that you can pull down the contact list to refresh it. After I understood this mechanism, I've had to explain it to every single person I introduced to Signal. This mechanism should be made discoverable in the UI. For example, you could add a note to the top of the contact list that says something like &quot;Pull down to refresh&quot;. It would disappear after the user does that once.

Person canl also make calls although sometimes the other end doesn't get notified of the call, and when it does, it's like 30 mins afterwards of a missed call. Here goes the debug log right after a call that audio was received but not sent: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/016231486a8eba60e526 I can see 2 java exceptions and termination stacks, so seems to me this person's phone model isn't well supported?

		Previous behavior (with Redphone): If I initiated a call from the system dialer for a user that was registered with Redphone, I received a pop-up asking if I wanted to upgrade the call to a Redphone call. In addition, calls showed up in the list of sent, received, and missed calls in the system dialer even if placed via Redphone. Current Behavior: With the introduction of Signal, there is no longer any dialer integration. Why the change matters: I think this was a nice feature as it means a user could simply initiate calls through the system dialer as opposed to opening Signal to initiate a call. This make it more likely that unsophisticated users, like my mother, would actually make secure calls since they don't have to do anything differently. A Google search revealed another user brought up this issue, but attempting to access that page results in a 404. I didn't see any existing issues in Github. Tested with Signal 3.1.1 and 3.3.1 on Cyanogenmod 11 (Milestone 11), Android 4.4.4, on a One Plus One (A0001).

		When i try to call another signal user over signal i get &quot;Login Failed!&quot; Error Message and the call aborts. Text messages do work without a problem. I have already tried resolve this issue by unregistering my mobile number via the webinterface and reregistering inside signal. I still get the error. Debug log. You'll find this Exception in line 881: W/InitiatingCallManager(21045): org.thoughtcrime.redphone.signaling.LoginFailedException: Initiate threw 401

 When i try to call my number from another signal instance (from Google Playstore) then an error message is displayed saying that the called party (me) is not capable of encrypted calls. But when i use the librephone app (xmikos) on my mobile to call the other way around it works very well. Please note that i do use the websocket version from xmikos. My understanding is that this build doesn't change the redphone part of signal so i come here for help.

		When sending a Signal message to a friend, I get this error notification. In the app, there's a red exclamation mark next to the message, it says 'Not delivered' and 'Tap for details'. When I tap, I get 'Some issues need your attention' and 'Failed to send' with the option to 'RESEND'. Resending just reproduces the same problem again. Here's the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5053bfb633d8b87091d7 I suspect this is related to a couple of other issues listed in the last three days (specifically this one and this one), but since it's not exactly the same (i.e. it works when I send to non-Signal users) I opened a new one. --sam

		I'm currently looking to write a Signal-compatible library that lets people send 2FA codes if supported, and fallback to SMS if not. Before I dive too deep, is ProtocolV2 going to be changed drastically any time soon? Or can I rely on that as a solid reference material with a reasonable level of confidence that there won't be a ProtocolV3 in the next month or so? (In case anyone is wondering, I will be using libsodium for Curve25519, etc. I will not be writing my own primitives!)

		I realize this feature is likely necessary to have anything close to sane battery usage/savings, but for those of us who run Cyanogen without any google service installed, it makes it impossible to benefit from the Signal app. It would be awesome if you were to make an option/version that would function without the push notifications of google. Keep up the good work!

		My friend previously used a fork of signal and I told him to get the official version from the playstore. Yet, while we both have the official signal from the playstore (Latest version). The encrypted call option is not available. The option is available for other contacts so I guess the problem is on his end. What could be the problem?

		Hello. With friends we installed Signal (2 Android users and 1 iPhone) and can't get connected secure calls between us. We verified our keys using barcode scanner and also sending SMS works. When I call a friend (he has same version of Signal, as we all installed it at same time), he gets the call ringing, but when he answers, on my (caller) side Signal still states &quot;Calling&quot; for a while and then drops the call. When he calls me, the situation is same, I get the call but when I answer it just states &quot;establishing connection&quot; or similar and then after a while it drops the connection. We have the same issue when we try to make calls on local Wifi or 3G/4G networks. I use Android 5.1.1. (non-roted, original ROM), Samsung S6 Edge Friend uses Android 5.0.2. (non-roted, original ROM), Samsung Note 3 Friend uses iPhone 5. Here is the full debug log from my phone: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3b39245965aeafc299de

		Any plans to add the same feature as Wickr ? ie. allowing one user to attach to a message a period at the end of which the message is destroyed locally and remotely (on both the sender and receiver phones). Like you can see on this screenshot of Wickr, you set up a time bomb on every new message, and all past message have an indication of when they will be deleted: Signal allow this locally but not remotely such as Wickr does. With this feature, there would be no more reason to use Wickr over Signal ! Thanks !

		I see two different behaviours when I am in Canada and in Chile, whenever I send a SMS (non-secure text message). In Canada (koodo), I see a check next to the message I sent, and that is. Good. In Chile (virgin, a virtual provider), I see a check, but I also receive from 1 to 3 extra messages saying: Mensaje fue recibido por +56######### . (which translates to Message was received by +56######### .) I believe I receive 1 message for as many cell-operators (roaming) the message have passed to get to its destination. And I guess that because the message is in Spanish, Signal does not parse it in order to hide it or change it for something else. The annoying part is that in a conversation, it appears that infamous message every time I sent something, so the thread is hard to follow. Besides that I get a notification when I have not received an actual reply, tricking me. If you point me in the right direction, I might provide a patch to fix it. Update: Android 4.4, Signal 3.3.1 (when it just became Signal from TextSecure).

		The string GroupUtil_joined_the_group &quot;%1$s joined the group&quot; cannot be translated properly. It can mean that one or more people joined the group. But for example in German you must specify &quot;has joined&quot; for singular, or &quot;have joined&quot; for plural. So it should use Android Plurals.

		This is a terrible title but here are the steps: Click FAB to get contact selection screen. Use keyboard to type letters and narrow down selection. Choose a contact Conversation window opens with keyboard open. Text box doesn't have focus. So, you can type on the keyboard without the letters actually going anywhere. Not sure if this is Signal's fault, or just Android. Signal 3.4.0, Moto G. Android 4.4.4 EDIT: last word typed appears after tapping on the &quot;text input&quot; box. This is after following above steps.

		I recently switched from a Nexus 5 to a Nexus 5X which also required a new SIM card. Prior to the switch I was a member of a group which had both Android and iOS members. On the new phone, the group showed up as &quot;Unnamed group&quot; and the member list was empty. I could still receive messages from the group but I could not send any. Both phones were running Android Marshmallow.

		Making calls through Signal... I'm having trouble with talking with a contact. He can hear me, whether I call him or he calls me... but I can't hear him. We're both on wifi, not mobile data. I don't know precisely which ports need to be unblocked there, but I do have other contacts I can speak with and we can all hear each other (though with those other contacts, I tend not to be able to receive their call signalling, where I can receive call signalling from this one.). I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Prevail LTE via Boost Mobile. He's on a Samsung Galaxy S4 via T-Mobile. We both rebooted our phones, and the situation remained the same.

		Over the last several days, I've noticed that messages are occasionally not being delivered (one checkmark) and I am unable to initiate a secure call to said contact. I confirmed that the user's phone was on at the time, he had a data connection (Wifi), and in fact the Signal app was opened in the background. The user was able to receive emails and regular phone calls without issue. Restarting the Signal app fixed the problem. In addition, after restarting the app, he recevied all my previous messages. This user was running Android 4.4.4 on a One Plus One with Signal 3.1.1. I had a similar issue with a Signal iOS user (Signal 2.2, iOS 8.4.1, iPhone 5S). Messages to that user went through nearly instantly but I was unable to initiate a secure call. However, the user could call me via Signal, and my phone rang nearly instantly. When the user closed the Signal app, I was able to initiate a call, and it rang on her phone within a second. I understand that Google Cloud Messaging is believed it be causing delayed message delivery intermittently. However, the behavior I'm seeing appears to impact both iOS and Android clients, the messages are not merely delayed but do not arrive at all until the app is restarted, and when the recipient restarts his/her Signal applicaiton, new messages sent to that user are delivered within seconds. As noted above, calls are also impacted. I can't see why restarting Signal would suddenly make GCM more reliable, so it seems there may be a bug in Signal causing the delays and inability to initiate secure calls. Would logs useful? If so, do you want them for me (sender) or the recipient that isn't receiving the messages?

		Steps to reproduce: Jerry calls George with Signal George answers They end the call Now the audio of George's phone is stuck to the handset earpiece speaker everything (music, videos, notifications) play through the earpiece every time George tries to adjust the volume of his phone he sees a bluetooth volume control overlay instead of the normal volume control overlay This does not seem to happen to Jerry's phone (i.e. the initiator of the call). To fix this George can call someone with Signal or system dialer and end the call immediately. Now audio will play through the loud speaker again and normal volume controls become available. This has been an issue for me since Signal 3.3.x (currently using 3.4.1) Affects both of my devices: Nexus 4, stock 5.1.1 Huawei U8800, 4.0.4

		Hi, I cannot connect using my phone number from New Caledonia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_New_Caledonia). The regulator uses 6-digits NSN (National Significant Numbers) and it seems there's an application validation before sending it to twilio. The application say that the number is invalid, twilio says it's OK using Lookup. The twilio's format verification API is free, it should be used instead of the in-app test.

		When creating a group with one or more contacts which aren't registered with Signal, there is a very clear notification that an MMS group will be created, which could lead to additional costs. Current experience: When someone unregisteres from Signal while s/he is part of a group, the other group members receive error messages saying the message couldn't be sent, even tough it is in fact sent to the remaining members of the group. The error message is even more confusing, because the message has the same &quot;click for more details&quot; notification next to it like messages that failed to send because the server couldn't be reached. In the latter case you can see to which members the message failed to send and just click &quot;resend&quot; to resolve the issue. In the &quot;a member of a signal group unregistered&quot; case there are no more details and nothing to do for the user. Proposed experience: When Signal notices that a group member is no longer registered, there should be a notification that this member was removed from the group and has to be readded manually if they register again. A fallback to MMS would probably be the worst option, because it could create huge intransparent costs e.g. for European users, leading to the immeadiate removal of the app. I'm looking forward to your thoughts and improvement ideas! Edit: The messages are usually delivered even if the error message is shown. But the constant error messages confuse users and make them loose faith in the app.

		When you sync Signal with your contact, you get two additional fields: &quot;Signal call&quot; and &quot;Message&quot;. When you change the language of your device it used to be enough to just resync and the language of theses field would also change. Not anymore. You have to remove and readd the Signal account in the Android settings. It is probably not a important bug because except me, nobody changes the language on a daily basis but well. I think I should mention it.

		It is impossible to send SMS to short numbers because it automatically adds the country code at the beginning of the number. For example for 2282 it adds +47 to the number so it will be +47 2282 if you live in Norway, that makes it impossible to send because the GSM networks (at least here in Norway) don't allow +47 in front of short numbers. I tried with version 3.3.3.

		Hey, I'm one of the translation maintainer. Each time a user wants to join a translation team I have to approve him/her manually, which is annoying and is not a good thing for people who want to translate right away. Could @moxie0 tick the box to make it so users can automatically join a translation team without someone having to approve them (as it was in the earlier versions of Transifex). I think you should be able to fix that by follow this link : https://www.transifex.com/moxie/teams/ and then clicking on TextSecure Team -&gt; Gear icon -&gt; ...

 I haven't crawled the commits to see when this began, but I will update if I get the chance. Device info: Nexus 5, stock Android 6.0 MRA58K, Signal 3.4.2 (028a1ab) App state: Signal registered, SMS enabled, default SMS app

		Noticed on mcginty/TextSecure@35d003a (#4589) GIFs shared with forwarding or from outside Signal don't move in the thumbnail or convo list preview, though the draft preview does move as well as it does in the image view some repro steps: in app attach: attach animated image gif see it move in draft send see it move in thumbnail see it move in convo list see it move in image viewer see all moving on receiver side forward moving preview gif forward message to self (or other convo) see draft moving send see STILL of gif in thumbnail see STILL of gif in convo list see it move in image viewer see SAME behavior on receiver side share to signal: choose your favorite gallery app pick animated gif share to signal pick contact or group see draft moving send see STILL of gif in thumbnail (or in one case just blackness instead of thumb) see STILL of gif in convo list (correct still in the above blackness case) see it move in image viewer see SAME behavior on receiver side

		In SaveAttachmentTask.java, the call to mimeTypeMap.getExtensionFromMimeType(contentType) with the type image/jpg returns null on devices with the AOSP version of MimeUtils.java. This is because the Android platform doesn't recognize image/jpg as a valid MIME type. With the image/jpeg type, however, an extension is returned as expected. MimeUtils.java (AOSP)     add(&quot;image/ief&quot;, &quot;ief&quot;);
    // add &quot;.jpg&quot; first so it will be the default for guessExtensionFromMimeType
    add(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;jpg&quot;);
    add(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;jpeg&quot;);
    add(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;jpe&quot;);
    add(&quot;image/pcx&quot;, &quot;pcx&quot;);
 I've dealt with issues in the past where device manufacturers have edited this map (love you, Samsung ㅗ*.*ㅗ), which may result in sending devices using content types which receiving devices cannot look up via getExtensionFromMimeType. Where to put a sanitizer might be a bit tricky. I'll dig deeper tomorrow.

		Verifying org.whispersystems:textsecure-android

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'Signal-Android'.
&gt; Checksum failed for org.whispersystems:textsecure-android:a08cdd73aaaca6d3e868a93522c02d6a159551735f7048b1f3a53582e10c8ec2

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED
 This appears to be related to an update of org.whispersystems.textsecure-android from 1.8.2 to 1.8.3 (as listed in build.gradle). On branch master, build.gradle still lists textsecure-android:1.8.2, and contains the correct checksum for that version.

		Regarding the recent commit 1323b49: Are you sure you want to use the term &quot;voice notes&quot;? When I google this term, I'm getting results like http://www.guidingtech.com/44248/voice-notes-android/, where a voice note is a note to oneself in the sense of a dictating machine. &quot;voice messages&quot; would be more appropriate imho. I can do a PR changing this if you want me to (a freebie of course).

		Hello. I'm using Signal v3.4.2 on a LG G4 H815 (running Android v5.1) with a wired earphone that has its own microphone. No problem at hearing the caller from the earphone, but Signal seems to use only the phone mic instead of the earphones' one, hence the caller hear my voice low, like 'from far away'.

		There should really be an option to send encrypted SMS instead of solely relying on an internet connection for encrypted chat. I mean, it's definitely possible between Signal users. The problem arises when one party does not have an internet connection, but both parties have a mobile signal. You have to resort to insecure SMS in order to get a message through. This shouldn't be the case. Between signal users, it should seamlessly be able to switch between secure SMS and secure IM when available.

		I just installed the new 3.5.0 beta and tried out the new voice message function. Receiving a voice message on iOS, I get &quot;Received unsupported attachment type.&quot;. I think this is due to https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/mms/AudioSlide.java#L38 where &quot;audio/*&quot; is explicitly set. If we would use &quot;audio/amr&quot; this would be matched by the MIME types in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS/blob/master/Signal/src/util/MIMETypeUtil.m#L15

		I have found something pretty annoying when recording voice messages. The last half a second or so always gets trimmed. My understanding is that the recording must be a multiple of 1 second, so if you record for 8.4 seconds you will lose the last 0.4 seconds. I don't have sound evidence for this but after several attempts it looks like it (or maybe it's just my imagination but the fact remains that I can't hear the last word I say in most messages). Android 4.1 Signal 3.5

		The new voice message can be recorded and sent even after leaving a group. The remaining group members also receive the message. Related to this is, what I think has already been reported elsewhere, that you can enter emojis and take photos in a group you left. However those can't be sent, because they require clicking the send button.

		Maybe one finds a better title for that enter any convo Open quick capture see blackness for about 1 sec (way to long 😛) then the image preview followed by a short focusing action close QC Now the funky (issue) part Open qc again see the previous preview shortly followed by a resize of the preview immediately followed by the correct preview And the side effect: While the previous preview is shown, the shutter icon isn't working (it blinks on taping, but doesn't capture). Whereas when in first (black preview) init it seems an immediate tap on the shutter always captures as soon as the preview is up. Seen with 3.5.0 on Z1c 5.1.1 3.5.0 black draft fix on HTC One S CM 12.1

		With signal 3.5.0 I get the following issue: Somebody who is not in my contact list sends me a push message. Two issues arise: Although he is using Signal for iOS I cannot respond to the message with an encrypted call (padlock symbol next to phone symbol is missing). The padlock symbol appears when I go into the new message screen and pull down the contact list to refresh the push information. I then have a conversation with the person via push messaging and later add him to my contact list. Some time after I add him I get a push notification stating &quot;... is now on Signal, say hey!&quot;, although the contact was Signal user before he first contacted me.

		A lot of translatable messages have linebreaks that seem unnecessary. As just a few examples: registration_progress_activity__your_device_needs_network_connectivity registration_progress_activity__no_network_connectivity registration_progress_activity__waiting_for_sms_verification registration_activity__your_country_code_and_phone_number There are dozens of others. Are these linebreaks actually useful for how the app runs, or are they there just to keep the line lengths in res/values/strings.xml under a certain limit? If it's the latter, then maybe they should be removed, because when translating in Transifex, they appear in a rather weird way, and the Transifex interface sometimes complains that they are not translated correctly, even when it appears completely artificial.

		Latency: Perhaps the most notable difference between making a Signal and a standard cell phone call is the latency encountered. In fact, it was the very first comment one of my friends mentioned when we initiated the call. RTT appears to be at least 1 second even when the person I'm calling is relatively close (several hundred miles on the East cost of the US, where Signal has a server - can't find the link now but Moxie published a blog post indicating where Signal has servers for routing calls). However, when I call the same person on Jitsi, the RTT is below 100 ms, and latency is barely noticeable. We are both connecting via Wifi using broadband connections with at least 50 Mbit down and 10 Mbit of upload capacity for him and 100/100 for me (Fiber on my end, cable on his). Jitsi shows effectively 0% packet loss and sub 5ms jitter with RTT typically around 50 ms. Thus, I would not expect significant latency in Signal given our geographic proximity and high speed, relatively low-latency connections. In fact, my Signal calls to the US from China seemed to have similar latency to the East Cost - East Coast US calls. Audio Quality: The audio quality in Signal appears to generally be worse than a cell phone call, and is significantly worse than Jitsi or Skype (both of which use wideband codecs - SILK for Skype IIRC and Opus @ 48 Khz for Jitsi). In addition, I notice more cut-outs and audio distortions with Signal. Again, both callers are on Wifi with high-speed broadband connections and are in relatively close physical proximity. I would imagine that implementing Opus in Signal would improve call quality generally, particularly if it is allowed to run in a wideband setting, as Opus is superior to Speex at all bitrates/sampling rates per the documentation. However, I'm rather perplexed about the subjectively high latency. Note: Wasn't sure whether to post this here or on the mailing list. Please advise.

		When sending a media message with a PNG attachment, Signal converts the PNG to JPEG (and scales it) before sending. Later, when choosing to save the image from the conversation, this JPEG is saved with a &quot;.png&quot; extension. This occurs because Attachment#updateAttachmentData replaces the attachment data stream without updating the attachment content type. Steps to reproduce Take a completely unamusing screenshot (PNG) to send to a contact Open Signal Open the conversation with said contact Tap the Attach button Tap the Image button Select the new screenshot from the documents provider Observe the draft media message with thumbnail Tap the Send button Wait for the media message progress to complete (converting to JPEG, scaling, sending) Long press the media message Tap the Save button Reluctantly embrace the security warning Observe the new Signal-yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss.png in /sdcard/Pictures adb pull this curious file and check check it Behold, a JPEG in disguise Device info: Nexus 5, stock Android 6.0 MRA58K, Signal 3.5.0 (473e470) App state: Signal registered, SMS enabled, default SMS app

I mean exactly that colored stripe where the text (&quot;Enter name...&quot;) resides on. Just a hair above or below that text. Try a couple of times if you initially don't hit the critical area - sooner or later you will (pretending that you don't want to hit it might help ;-) ). 3.)

		I'm relatively new to both Android and Signal, so this could be my own mistake. I've noticed that messages only arrive when I'm on a WiFi network. Over my mobile network (4G) I never receive message. I notice this when I finally connect to a WiFi network and the messages come flooding in. I checked the Signal settings but can't see anything that would affect this. I've also checked to ensure background data is allowed both globally for mobile internet, and specifically for Signal.

		Signal can literally expire any second, so that out of a sudden you are not able to send messages anymore (well, of course only if you do not update it for 90 days). Immediately updating the app right then might not be possible if you require a wifi connection. I am sure that this is not a problem for any of the people involved here, but for other non tech-savvy users it can be (firsthand experience). Reasons for apps not updating automatically: new permission required (happened before the RedPhone integration) not enough free space on the device available for some other reason... it is not uncommon for me to see 10 or so pending app updates on other peoples's devices There should be a time-triggered warning, or some other trigger to inform the user beforehand.

However, since Hebrew is written right-to-left, as are Arabic, Persian and a few other languages, it requires a bit of extra work to make it properly functional in RTL. For example, in the Settings menu all the items are aligned to the left, and they should be aligned to the right. I'm not an Android developer, but as far as I know, since Android 4 or so, most of this can be done by enabling auto-support for RTL somewhere in the app's build definitions (I'm sorry if my language here is imprecise).

		Link a device, then unlink it from the device mgmt screen. A spinner is displayed and does not go away even though unlinking is complete. The user is forced tap the back arrow and select Devices again to link a new device. Expected: Once unlinking is finished, the view re-renders the 0-1 remaining devices and the floating action button, so that the user can immediately link another device.

		I'm not entirely sure how contacts discovery is done in Signal right now, so if it's done in a private manner feel free to close this ticket, but if contact numbers are currently being sent to a server, you can use the following server/protocol to avoid the server knowing too many details about the user's address book: https://github.com/SilentCircle/contact-discovery

		Hello, I am trying to run my own textsecure-server. When I connect android to server it gives connection error as ' Signal was unable to connect to push service'. I created my own certificate. Changed TEXTSECURE_URL in build.gradle to ip address of my server as 'https://ip_adress/'. When I change this URL to 'http:ip_address:8080' - android connects to server but after verification,in registering with server part, it gives the same error. Maybe someone can help me.

		I had created a group and added people to it. All was OK until I kept getting failures in sending messages. I rebooted my phone (N5 fully updated) and even then it could not send. I could send to one-on-one message threads, just not groups. The group that I was trying to send to was created by me and I am not sure if I had added others to be admin as well. I deleted the app and reinstalled from Google Play. But I cannot get back into that group now. The group still exists and the others in the group are able to communicate. They do see my phone trying to reconnect and being told to accept me. It seems that I did get accepted but what I see on my phone after being accepted is a group name that is: &quot;unamed group&quot; and &quot;textscrure_grop!9...&quot;. I cannot enter any text, image etc. I do see others posting messages but I cannot respond at all. What additional info can I gather to try to debug? Thanks.

		I know that the Chrome extension hasn't officially been released yet, but since it looks like it's getting closer, I might as well point out this issue I'm having. Put your phone in offline mode; Use the Signal-chrome to send some messages to some people. Wait until they are delivered; Turn on your phone's wifi/data. All the messages will be synced, but they will appear as not delivered. I think this is a problem with the app on Android and not the browser extension because this problem is less frequent if I leave my phone's data on (though it's definitely still present, just not 100% of the time).

		After I sent an encrypted message to my only signal-using contact this morning (who for some reason sometimes sends me encrypted texts and sometimes unencrypted), Signal suddenly began the registration process again. I received a message before it finished, and my reply was sent unencrypted. After exchanging a couple unencrypted messages, clicking the button that appeared up top to enable encrypted functionality and seeing the registration window again, I generated a debug log: https://gist.github.com/e79519a8188d259844c0 . My device and app version are listed there: Device : samsung SGH-T399 (gardaltetmo) Android : 4.2.2 (T399UVUAOH2, JDQ39.T399UVUAOH2) App : Signal 3.5.2 After three attempts to register, I had successfully registered again. The first two were interrupted by incoming messages or my attempt to generate a bug report. During this time I successfully received an unencrypted MMS from my contact. This was the first time I had successfully received an MMS on this phone; this was also my first signal mms. Earlier I was using smssecure and my mms images just showed as &quot;trying to contact server&quot;. Signal would not complete registration until I'd uninstalled smssecure. I asked my contact to generate a debug log. Here it is: https://gist.github.com/4837204c21c5b7c2ece4 My preferences: Receive all SMS, all MMS; SMS delivery reports on; Wifi Calling disabled. Notifications enabled; default ringtone; vibrate on; LED blue; LED blink normal; in-thread notifications enabled; never repeat alerts; display name and message in notifications passphrase disabled; screenshots blocked; no blocked contacts dark theme media auto-download only when using wifi (my phone is on wifi now); do not delete old messages no linked devices signal messages and calls enabled; enter key does not send; do not use system emoji

		Hi, I couldn't find where can translate the description of the app for Play store. For example, if the app is viewed in the Play store in Hebrew, then the short description is shown in machine translation, which is incorrect, and makes it hardly possible to understand what the app is, because it auto-translates the word &quot;Signal&quot; to a Hebrew word that is unrelated to the actual app's name, and makes several grammatical mistakes. That's how machine translations usually are. The long description with a list of features is shown in English, without any translation. The solution is to let the translators at Transifex translate these descriptions. That's how it's done for the Wikipedia app, for example, and it works well.

		Yeah, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking &quot;Are you sure it's not the light is different or something like that?&quot; and my response to that is YES. I am sure. I've taken pictures back and forth, up and down, trying to make them look as similar to each other as I possibly can, yet somehow the pictures taken in the app ALWAYS ends up being darker. It's as if a layer of blue has been added on it. This only happens when using the front camera. Pictures taken with the back camera are always identical. Log of a picture taken with the camera, in the attachments drawer. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0aa96b2ee4a46ab55212 Log of a picture taken with the quick capture in app thingy https://gist.github.com/anonymous/22329ca762cb287838dc Can anyone else try this and see if they have the same results? I'm going to try it with my Galaxy Nexus now. Just say the word and I'll email you two pictures of myself so that you can see normal me and blue me side by side. Edit: Same thing on my stock Galaxy Nexus. The pictures are definitely darker in app, compared to the &quot;real&quot; camera.

		Playing around with the new archive feature, I found it highly unintuitive to unarchive using the same gesture as to archive. It appears more natural to swipe the opposite direction when unarchiving. Additionally the arrow to leave the archive points to the left, too. It appears suggestive. However, this might also be very well my own based perception. PS: I thought there was already an issue created for this idea, but I was unable to find it. Sorry, if this is indeed a duplicate.

		I can remove a complete conversation, including text messages and entries for accepted/missed calls in it. I can also remove single text messages from a conversation. However, I cannot remove just (single or all) call entries from a conversation, which I would have expected to be possible. I rarely delete a complete conversation, as there usually are some messages in it that I still want to keep. This currently implies that I also have to keep all call entries, which is slightly annoying, as they contain practically no information. In my opinion, to make removing call entries possible, there should be at least one of the following features: I should be able to select and remove call entries just like text messages. I should be able to &quot;lock&quot; text messages so they are not removed when I delete the conversation. (This is currently on Signal 3.6.1 on Android.)

		Signal was just updated, so this bug report is for 3.6.0. Debug log, unfortunately after the automatic software update. Every month, on the 1st, my power company sends me an sms asking for the current value of the power meter in my apartment, to keep track of usage. I never received their sms yesterday. I know it was sent, because I also have an app installed which looks up unknown phone numbers and this app triggered and displayed a notification that it had looked up +47 2262, which is the expected number. I'm aware of two other dropped sms. I figured the first one was a network failure, and told my gf to turn on delivery notification. After doing that, she told me one of her messages went undelivered the other day. 👍 1

		Phone: OnePlus Two with CyanogenMod 12.1 Signal version: 3.6.1 Issue: When I am connected to a Wifi network through Shaw (home, wifi hot spots, etc), I cannot send or receive any messages securely. I also cannot un-register or re-register my phone number until I switch to Mobile Data. On Telus Wifi, it works fine. I can still send un-encrypted SMS messages to other contacts. Tonight, a family member that is also on Signal had issues sending and receiving on Shaw. I have contacted Support, but this seems like a big problem. Debug Log shows lots of errors about the certificates; for example, line 21: W/OkHttpClientWrapper(16616): javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.. This error repeats a few times. The date and time on my device is correct, as is the time zone. I do not have any user-installed root certificates.

		With Android sounds set to &quot;Priority Mode&quot;, the incoming message notification sound is still audible when viewing an active conversation. I believe that if priority notifications are turned off for Signal, then all notifications, including in-thread notifications, should be silenced when Android is in priority only mode. So, these in-thread notifications should be silenced as well in &quot;Priority&quot; mode since they are not priority notifications. To clarify, the android priority setting works for the other notifications from the Signal app; the issue only affects the &quot;in-thread&quot; notifications. I am using Signal 3.6.1 on Android 5.1.1. I have an LG Nexus 4 device with T-Mobile USA as the carrier.

In Signal-Android, choose Settings; Devices; +; scan QR code) The resulting screen with title 'Manage linked devices' has text that is barely or not readable while it is light grey on a white background. Only the text 'Link device' is blue on white. In the light theme, the text is black on white background an easily readable. Attached is a 'screenshot' made with a camera pointed at the screen of a Galaxy S6.

		After a recent update to Signal, the app no longer plays the notification tone I have set in the Signal settings, when I receive a new message. I simply have Signal set to my default notification tone for all conversations. But instead of playing my default notification tone, I get an old fashioned PC style system beep. Here's the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/45d13a4bbaff57f96f2b

		Seems to affect only conversations with the last message sent before updating to 3.7.0. After updating to 3.7.0, sending a message then quickly tapping Back before the conversation's delivery status icon is updated works as expected: the conversation list's delivery status icon is updated in realtime. Steps to reproduce Launch Signal / navigate to the conversation list Find pre-3.7.0 update Signal conversation with only one checkmark Tap conversation If the last message indeed has only one checkmark, repeat steps 1 through 3 Observe two checkmarks Tap back to return to the conversation list Behold the updated delivery status icon with two checkmarks Device info: Nexus 5, stock Android 6.0 MRA58K, Signal 3.7.0 (b99c4e3) App state: Signal registered, SMS enabled, default SMS app

		This happened while using Signal 3.6.1 on Android 6.0 I recently got a new phone and some of my contacts did not get migrated. One of those missing contacts sent me a signal message, and then we proceed to exchange a few messages. After manually adding them to my contacts I got a 'Say Hey!' message for them. Since I had just exchanged signal messages with this number, it seems redundant to me.

		At the moment (Signal 3.7) thumbnails for sent images are still cropped versions instead of resized versions of the images. This changes the aspect ratio of the picture and zooms to some &quot;random&quot; area inside the picture. Would love to see the thumbnails rather have a maximum width with fixed aspect ratio. Would make them look so much better.

		Feature proposal: Add delivery date/time for outgoing SMS/Signal messages in &quot;message details&quot;. In a similar way that we can see when the incoming message was both sent and delivered in the &quot;message details&quot; dialog, add this functionality to the outgoing messages. Right now, only &quot;sent&quot; date/time is shown there. Regarding privacy implications - this will not change anything there, no extra info is required from the recipient to provide. Just present the already non-secret &quot;second checkmark's timestamp&quot; in a more convenient way to the user (via &quot;message details&quot; dialog). Just as the &quot;second checkmark&quot; itself, the usability of this if obvious, especially if a contact in a bad reception area and you don't get the &quot;second checkmark&quot; right away. For SMS, this functionality is provided by most SMS apps if &quot;delivery receipts&quot; are enabled. So in a way, using Signal as SMS client in current form reduces this sms functionality (so for SMS case it might as well be considered as a bug).

		Im on CopperheadOS (hardened Android based on Cyanogenmod 12.1). When I open the overview of recent apps, I can clearly read my recent conversation. I can't read it when the app is locked thogh. But shouldn't the preview be disabled at all when screen security is on? That would make more sense in my opinion.

		Since Signal 3.7.0 message delivered/received status in displayed also in the conversation overview screen. However I sometimes notice that a (old) message there only displays one check mark. If I enter the conversation I see that the last message has two check marks. If I then go back to the conversation overview there are also two check marks. I also see this with SMS. Found with Signal 3.7.0.

		If you try to send a message in Signal but you have a very poor data signal, Signal send you a notification that your message could not be delivered. After that, the user can manually select something like &quot;Try sending again&quot;. Wouldn't it be a better way to automatically send the message again if the signal is back (like the other messenger apps, e.g. Whatsapp)?

		Since the last update the quick reply notification is not working correctly. Before you could answer a message from within another app via the drop down quick reply. Since the last update every time i hit send in the drop down reply, signal opens the whole conversation in full screen after 1-2 second pause. This is super annoying, especially since this feature worked flawlessly before. Signal 3.6.1 on Galaxy S5 Android 5.0 debug log: https://gist.github.com/046313199cc0ca251291

Basically, when placing a call, it keeps ringing and then says call disconnected - even though the other person didn't even see the call. After a minute, Signal app shows call missed.

		Signal should incorporate sending messages via RCS-e. SMS integration is already awesome. RCS-e is being pushed as the next generation messaging protocol by some telecommunication providers but they are all lacking a good app to use the service. Signal could make use of an existing RCS-e service (already present on some devices) or get an option to download the generic RCS-e service APK by the GSMA. Integration guides are readily available. 👍 6

		Hi, when tapping a contact picutre in the conversation list i get the toast message &quot;Keine Apps zum Anzeigen dieses Kontakts verfügbar&quot; which translates to &quot;No apps for viewing this contact available.&quot;. Expected result: I contact selected should be opened in the address book or the information should somehow be displayed. Maybe this has something to do with my phone having a custom (vendor supplied) contacts app. I am running Signal 3.7.1 on a Honor 7 Stock (Android 5.0.2) Please let me know if I can be of further help.

		This is a small change, but it should improve user experience. I can imagine that it is confusing, especially for new users who don't know that Signal was called TextSecure before, to find out that your Signal plaintext backups are saved to a file called TextSecurePlaintextBackup.xml. Looking at the code, PlaintextBackupImporter.java should probably keep looking for TextSecurePlaintextBackup.xml (besides the new SignalPlaintextBackup.xml) for backward compatibility.

		When joining a new group it's sometimes hard to find out which people belong to which phone number. Asking everyone in the group who they are is tedious. It would be nice to be able to set a nickname in the app, that's sent in an extra field in each group message. The receiving clients could show this nickname if the number has no associated contact. Setting a nickname would of course be optional and the nickname is only sent in group messages. Other messengers support this as well and it's very useful to find out who the person is that just sent a message in a group. 👍 2

		Hi folks! It would be great if you could toggle encrypted calling as a per contact preference by doing a long click on the phone icon similar how you can do the same with the SMS button. Perhaps a graphic image of a phone with an unlocked image where the padlock is a little bigger for emphasis but unlocked and red.

		Explicitly disabling all encrypted calling to all parties should be possible somehow since a lot of people complain that its functionality is rather limited at this stage (not working most of the time) but they enjoy the text features of the app which are rather solid. If encrypted calling is disabled the people on the contacts list should be updated via the server that encrypted calling is inhibited for that party and not display a phone locked icon. Previous to the merge of Textsecure and Rephone we had a choice. Now we don't. Maybe an advanced option?

		There is one particular group I'm in in which no messages I write on my Android phone sync to Signal-Desktop. As far as I can tell only this group has the issue. I also get an error when sending, but it doesn't show any particular problem. When I click on the error symbol in the message, there isn't an error next to any contact. When I go into the message detail view via long-press -&gt; info, then it shows the &quot;resend&quot; button next to every contact. Bit strange, really. This group contains a user who unregistered from Signal. adb logcat from when I pressed the send button until sending was completed and I got the error message on the phone: https://4z2.de/signal_faillog_ipahqu2Shoh6.txt (manually cleaned, because it's from adb logcat - I only anonymized the phone numbers)

		if you are not or no more signal registered and if you enter the devices activity, a message saying &quot;Network connection failed&quot; (also see WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop#499) you can dismiss that by tapping the soft key 'back' then you can add a device via scan and by that register/pseudo-link the desktop and by that you have a desktop only signal registration (and maybe some other oddnesseses)

		When I joined Signal I was asked to invite my friends. I hesitated because I was afraid the invatation would be send to all my contacts (many business contacts and rarely used contacts among). Now again I wanted to do this manually be selecting &quot;Invite friends&quot; from the main menu. This really makes the impression that the SMS would be send to all contacts without being able to preselect which contacts to send it to: Input: I can edit the message which is supposed to be send. Submit button: Says &quot;Send SMS&quot; Of course I did not! Do not want to send this to all my 300 contacts. I just learned from the documentation at http://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/213190647-Group-SMS (under option B) Use the invite flow to share through SMS or other media at the bottom) that one can indeed select the ones to whom the SMS should be send. The UI flow should make it clear that &quot;Send SMS&quot; button does not immediately send the SMS. It should be clear that I can select the contacts to whom the invatation is send. The way it is now I assume that many users hesitate to use the &quot;bulk&quot; friends invitation. This hampers the spread of Signal I am afraid.

		Since version 3.7.2, it is impossible to open multiple links from a conversation in separate browser tabs, as every link will be opened in the same tab and so, overwrite the previously opened link. I am using Firefox for Android. It does not seem to be a Firefox bug, as with other apps the browser behaves as expected (it is opening a new tab for every link)

		While Signal currently supports GIFs, it requires storing them on your local device (which is annoying). Since GIPHY has an API for searching GIFs, it should be plausible to implement a client-side feature where the client finds a GIF using GIPHY and then sends it without saving it locally (or temporarily saving it). The only issue I can see is that GIPHY would be told that a particular person is a Signal user.

		Hey guys, I have an OnePlus one with (now) Android 6. I dirty-flashed from Lollipop and got stuck in a Boot-Loop. After that i tried to restore backup to the Lollipop but still Bootloop so i had to make an Factory-Reset on the phone. Now i have an complete Backup of my System with TWRP but can't get it to work with my &quot;new&quot; Signal so my old Keys and Messages won't get lost. The things i tried: Install Signal on new OS and changed the directory /data/data/org.thoughtcrimes.securesms with the one from backup. Also changed owner and group to the new user and group of signal Deinstall everything from Signal. Copy the directory to data/data/ and then install Signal from Play Store in hope it will see that it will find the old files. Still no success Could you give me a hint how to restore my old Keys? My Messages aren't even so importend. Only the Keys. If neccessary i will upload some LogCats if you want to

		I installed Signal on Android and very shortly after got messages from two friends who both use Signal congratulating me on installing it. The two conversations were colored primary red and primary green. I assumed that these colors signified some meaning about the conversations like maybe the green one was secure and the red one was insecure. I did some Googling and found Issue #945 which seemed to imply that the issue color indicated the transport medium that the message arrived by. I asked @mfb and he figured out what was going on, that these colors were meant to differentiate conversations from each other. I'd like to recommend / feature request, excluding meaning rich colors from use as differentiating conversation colors, at least initially, to avoid confusing the user. If for example the first two conversations were in pastels or in pretty much any two colors other than red and green (which have a very strong visual meaning of stop/go success/error good/bad) I think I would have begun to intuit that the colors were for conversation differentiation. I'd also say that if it started out with pastels or some other non-meaning-rich colors and I later encountered red and green conversations I'd probably intuit they were just there for differentiation. Since it looks like conversation color is driven directly by the contacts name I'm not sure it would make sense to tweak the initial colors as the user begins using the app. Since, by my read, of the list of colors, only red and green have a strong meaning. All the others seem not meaning rich to me, maybe just remove red and green. Problem there is that existing users mapping of which conversations have which colors would change, possibly confusing people. So, hopefully someone here has a better idea of a solution here than what I've come up with.

		Allow the choice of font size for chat screen : either exact size in points or simply small-medium-large will likely be more than enough. It's a basic option supported by most messengers - even by the stock sms client ! I have a 6&quot; smartphone and the standard font size is way too large for my screen, which could easily and usefully fit much more text. Others, e.g. those with poor eyesight or those with small screens, might find the standard font size too small to read comfortably. I believe this would be a useful feature and one that's probably pretty straightforward to implement. 👍 1

		The text box message placeholder's size/positioning doesn't match the text you actually see when typing. This leads to a somewhat jarring visual experience when looking at the app. Here is the placeholder: And here is &quot;S&quot; entered in the text box: The placeholder is smaller than the actual entered S, so when you see the placeholder then start typing, the text feels like it suddenly changes size/style. It would be good if they lined up correctly. For example, here is Hangouts, where the &quot;W&quot; lines up exactly with the placeholder when entered. With this, there's no discrepancy when beginning typing or deleting all entered text. All screenshots here are taken at the same scaling, and are only cropped. 👍 1

		Signal is my favourite application for both SMS and encrypted messaging. However given the fact that SMS spam is on the rise, It would be a very useful feature to support some sms spam blocking. There are many third party application that do this but they require changing the default SMS application. I think any of the following features would be useful: Options to only issue a notification for messages from known contacts. Word based classification/blacklists (perhaps with an option to never block messages from known contacts) Number blacklists (arguably easy for spammers to circumvent) Of course there are more sophisticated options as well, but these may provide the greatest bang for buck.

		During registration (just after installation) the user has to enter its phone number manually. The national code (e.g. +49 is prefilled). This is not optimal because: Users are (psychologically) relactant to (actively) enter personal data like phone number that is sent to some server (which they've just heard about somewhere). So I've really seen friends aborting the registration at this very step. This is really a UX issue. It's about 9 unnessary keystrokes more At least in Europe people mess up with the leading 0 in phone numbers. A lot of people without internatinal relations do not know (or at least are puzzled about) that the leading 0 is to be ignored after the internal code of +49 Would be good if the users phone number could be automatically retrieved from the phone by Signal and the number prefilled into the input form. A user could still change the prefilled number just in case.

Nevertheless I need a few of them, so I want to enable only these I really need. I already figured out, that I need to enable the Equifax root certificate for GCM. (which is needed for message notifications) But which root certificate do I need to enable to send and receive images and videos within Signal? Thanks a lot for the info, uiop

		I have a few contacts that still have Signal installed in hopes of bugs like WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS#421 being resolved but do not prefer Signal for their daily driver until the application is usuable for them. Which for users that are experiencing this iOS bug, the application is insanely frustrating to use. Signal rightfully defaults to messaging being secure. However, when I switch to insecure for this contact, move to another contact the method of delivery is still insecure. This is also true the other way around. If I switch that contact back to secure and then go to the contact that prefers insecure (iMessage conveniences etc.) then the delivery is set to secure. Steps to reproduce: Open Signal contact &quot;A&quot;, send insecure message Open Signal contact &quot;B&quot;, message defaults to insecure Change delivery of message for Signal contact &quot;B&quot; back to secure. Switch to Signal contact &quot;A&quot;, message delivery now set to secure due to action in step 3 I would like to see a per-conversation or per-contact preference for delivery of secure vs insecure. An additional &quot;remind/confirm insecure messages in x days/hours&quot; would also be awesome.

		Other than WhatsApp or Telegram, Signal does not distinguish between a received message and a seen message. Whatsapp and Telegram indicate that a message has been seen by coloring the double check mark. Signal does not color the double check mark. When I first started using Signal, this really confused me. It felt like something did not work, like the other person wasn't reading my messages. I think it might help new users if Signal adopted the de-facto standard by coloring the double check mark in the primary color of the conversation.

		For some reason, I'm seeing two checkmarks for SMS messages. It's been happening for ~28 hours now : so since 3.8.0. Is anyone else seeing this? 3.8.1 on Android 4.4.4, Moto G 2013

		When a Bluetooth audio device is already connected and selected for call audio, Signal uses it just fine. However, when you want to swap an already-established call to a Bluetooth headset, there is no means to do so without disconnecting the call and establishing a new one. (In addition, when you start a call on Bluetooth and then wander out of range, such as might happen when you leave your phone in your vehicle at a gas station, many phones will silently redirect the call back to the standard ear speaker. In these cases, when you get back out to the vehicle, these phones typically will reconnect with the Bluetooth headset but will not redirect the call audio back to the headset.) So, in addition to the speakerphone option, I would like to see a Bluetooth option that would attempt to change the call audio stream to a Bluetooth headset. Security considerations: This could potentially pose a threat when there is a Bluetooth sniffer near the phone that's trying to use Bluetooth (given the differences between Bluetooth encryption and Signal encryption). It does not impact security of the call stream over the cellular or wifi networks. This would seem to be no more risky than the current state of being willing to use a Bluetooth headset if it is configured before the call starts. Please do not take Bluetooth functionality away; several of my contacts will refuse to use Signal any longer if they cannot use it with their Bluetooth headsets.

		Hi, when a contact changed his key and sends a message to a group, a &quot;you must accept the new key&quot; message appears in his 1-on-1 thread. Once I accept the key, the message is then also displayed in his 1-on-1 thread, and not in the group. I think Signal should decode messages with unknown keys even before the key was accepted (shouldn't be a security risk?), and extract from that where to place the message, i.e. whether it's a 1-on-1 message or a group message.

		Hi, I am no expert in this area, and just want throw this in in case. It seems that Telegram can use either GCM as notification channel, or its own Notification service bypassing GCM. I know that Signal is replying on GCM for notification service, just wonder wehther you guys can use some of techniques used by Telegram, so that you don't have to rely on GCM. Again, not an expert on this and just a curious thoughts. THanks

		Per documentation, the user is unable to get a call-first registration. This alienates users who use calling-only cell plans where sending and receiving texts is possible but costs money. A simple solution would be to add a &quot;call me instead&quot; button to the bottom left of the &quot;Connect With Signal&quot; prompt, which immediately calls the user. This would allow those users to use Signal while causing no friction to anyone else. Side note: Although I do not know for sure, I believe the iOS app behaves in the same way. Can anyone else confirm?

		Creating a new ticket because the existing tickets that are similar do not have relevant titles and/or are similar but different problems. I can't hear my contact's voice at all. The mute/unmute or speaker phone buttons don't have any effect. The problem is that it's absolutely silent like my contacts have put my call on mute. I can't hear anything on a voice call at all; not even feebly. This is on a Motorola Moto E (2nd Gen). Logs here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e31c228270dd22f8f5b6

		Hi! I tried to validate my Google Voice number, which I know you have as a known issue as not working. But my issue is why you don't allow manual validation. I to receive the SMS over Google Voice and it's just not caught by the app. The next step is to be called and manually enter what I hear in a text box. My question is: why don't you allow the validation text box to be used for SMS too. It's great that you have the automatic SMS validation (it's user friendly) but after the timeout, you could just leave the option to have the SMS code manually entered. It would offer more flexibility and I don't see what would be the downside (if I am wrong, do tell). Thanks!

		Updated (2016-02-27): Version: 3.12 Nexus is ok. x5pro still misbehaving. The bug is likely in the rom. But since there are so many affected devices and related regressions as system and apps are updated, I'll keep this issue open unless told otherwise. 2016-02-23: Version: 3.11.1 Affected devices: Nexus 4 and Doogee X5 Pro. Stock unrooted roms or rooted roms regardless. Possibly dupe of: #1037 This used to only affect the x5pro but now the nexus recently shown the same bug. Also, Whatsapp doesn't display this bug so this is likely a Signal issue \ workaround-able android issue. Previously: Notes: Version: 3.8.1 This is was originally thought to be an OEM related bug. Now it's been confirmed on two separate devices from two separate OEMs. One of which is running a custom ROM... Also, I have no idea how process and memory management actually works in Dalvik\ART so the terminology section is my ad-hoc attempt to work around this. Terminology: Foregrounded: Visible. Full-screened. &quot;The running&quot; app. Backgrounded: Closed. Still visible in the Recents tasks list. Shown to be running under in Settings-&gt;Apps-&gt;Running Apps. Daemonized: Closed, Not visible in Recents. But still shown running as a service in Settings-&gt;Apps-&gt;Running Apps. Killed: Closed, Not visible in Recents. Not shown under Settings-&gt;Apps-&gt;Running Apps. Scenario: 2 clients; 1 Nexus 4 (works as expected), 1 Doogee X5Pro (misbehaving). Working: 1. When both phones have Signal foregrounded, messages pass back and forth smoothly and instantaneously. 2. When Signal is Foregrounded on one phone while backgrounded on the other, a notification appears correctly. 3. When the Nexus has Signal daemonized after being swiped off Recents, while the X5pro is sending through a foregrounded Signal, a notification appears correctly. 4. When the X5pro has Signal backgrounded, notifications appear correctly while the Nexus is sending them through the foregrounded Signal client. Not-working: Swiping off Signal from Recents doesn't daemonize the process. Instead it's killed and Signal messages fail to transfer. SMSs still work (I'm guessing a separate android daemon\service handles that). Extra-credits: When remaining opened under Recents, Signal is indicated to occupy 26mb. When daemonized it's 6mb. Since I have no idea how Dalvik\Android actually manages memory, I can't say if that's address space (virtual memory) or resident memory or just what the Dalvik's process heap is pointing at... TLDR: Seems on some phones, swiping off Signal from the Recents tasks-list doesn't daemonize properly. Instead, Signal is closed off entirely and Signal messages fail to transfer. Edit: Updated reflecting further feedback. And version.

		When taking a picture with the front camera using direct capture in collapsed state the resulting image is different compared to the preview. The preview shows the lower portion from a full screen capture, while the resulting image is from the middle portion of a full screen capture. I will try to explain the issue with an image series. The first one is an image of the phone with the camera preview. Note the detail marked with the red circle in the upper right corner. The next one is the preview of the taken picture. Note the detail mentioned before is now in the lower left corner. I wanted to take a screenshot from the camera preview but strangely the screenshot shows the view like for the taken picture. This is why the first pictures a not screenshots. See the third picture. The last image is a full screen capture of the same scene. I suppose the region in the camera preview is different to the final region applied. This happens only with the front camera using direct capture in collapsed state. The back camera works as expected. Device info: Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini, Stock Android 4.4.2, Signal 3.8.1 Debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b3bc25fd68eb6fc8bec2

The system phone app also suffers from this, but I think Signal can do better. I am not able to take a screenshot as taking a screenshot closes the volume menu. A few solutions: Move the system volume menu down slightly Move the call info/status up slightly or down a lot Block system menu from appearing, put volume controls on in-call menu

		I noticed I couldn't send media from Signal, even though text was going through. I figured it's AdBlock, which runs a localhost proxy on my phone, and it was. I turned it off and Signal was able to send pictures and audio without a hitch. Now I would just like to know, is there a way to bypass the proxy for Signal? Can I just bypass certain domains in the network settings? HTC phone with Android 4.1.2, not rooted.

		I think the &quot;gong&quot; that is played when a call successfully connects is VERY loud. I've had lasting pain in my ear from hearing it when all other volumes on my phone are normal. This in combination with Signal's frequent issues with low call volume, and the fact that this &quot;gong&quot; plays at a time when other call apps are done with connection signals have made me on several occasions position the speaker for max volume, hoping to hear my call partner, just to be surprised by the loud gong. Please lower this sound, or just double tap the sound that plays while it tries to connect. 👍 4

		Signal does not provide many information about itself within the app. The only things are the help menu, which links directly to the support page, and the Signal version number hidden in advanced settings. Many apps provide an &quot;About&quot; screen. I would expect to be able to see: the app name, logo and version number vendor name and link to website some short text regarding the functionality hints regarding contributing and funding license / open-source information Basically things that can be found in the README.md (but shorter).

		My girlfriend has my old Galaxy S4 and upgraded to the very last version of TextSecure. Today she got a message stating the following: “Your build of textsecure has expired.” When she tries to update to Signal, the Playstore progress bar hangs forever. Everything else on the phone (including the Playstore) is working except the Signal update. Can you please help? Nothing is working so far. Her phone is running the version of Android that preceded Kitkat. Whatever the last update for the Galaxy S4 official version might have been, she’s got that. She's also looking for an SMS backup utility that works with TextSecure if she can't get the Signal upgrade to work and has to uninstall.

		System info: Cyanogenmod based on Android 4.4 Steps to reproduce: Install Signal from the Play Store and open it Enter phone number and hit register It now shows a couple of steps: connect to server, waiting for sms, generating keys and something else (I annoyingly can't make a screenshot, a bug exclusive to this app). The connect to server (to request an SMS) succeeds. Then SMS arrives and Signal goes on to generate keys. When that finishes, which is really quick, it complains about not being able to connect to the server. Wait, what? It can contact the servers to send an SMS but is then unable to contact the server? I guess it must be a bug.

		The app currently does not ask for re-input of the password when disabling the use of the passphrase. Depending on the length of time for your time out window, this could become hazardous. This is not really a FR since I know you guys don't like them, but it might be worth consideration if anyone agrees with me.

		Hi, My phone is rarely connected to the Internet. When I send a cyphered message, the GUI tells me everything is OK (double check mark is shown, date of departure is &quot;right now&quot;/&quot;à l'instant&quot; - in French -, etc) even if there is no internet connection and the message has not left my device! There should be, at least, a warning that the message has not been sent, better, that an internet connection is required, or even better, a proposition to start a connection (Wifi/4G/...) or an automatic opening/closing of a connection just to send the message.

		Hi, I'm browsing the web with the default Android 4.4.4 browser. I want to send the current URL to a friend. From the contextual menu (opened with the menu button on my phone), I select &quot;Share&quot; (&quot;Partager&quot; in French), then I select &quot;Signal&quot;. There I arrive on a page with only a few of my contacts (what is this page???). I the friend I want to contact is listed, then that's OK, I can create a message with the correct link. However, if the friend is not there, and I clic on the top right &quot;+&quot; symbol, Signal opens my whole contact list, BUT as soon as I select someone there, it creates an EMPTY message. The URL is lost :{

		Hi, On my Android 4.4.4, I can open the &quot;Task Manager&quot; by pressing the &quot;Home&quot; button for a while. Then I can slide applications on the left/right to kill/close them. The default (and correct) behaviour is that when I kill an App, I stay in the TaskManager, so that I can kill more apps. Unfortunately, when I kill Signal, the TaskManager itself is closed, so that if I want to kill several App, I must ensure that Signal is the last one I kill, otherwise I have to run again the TaskManager since Signal has killed it. This is very inconvienient...

		I'm submitting this report on behalf of a concerned friend. Their phone is setup in such a way that many of the contacts stored in the phone are not to be contacted directly (i.e. via the phone number registered with WhisperSystems). These contacts are only to be contacted via some off channel (email, other phone, etc). Anyways, upon installing or updating (I don't recall which it was) to the latest version of Signal, they received a number of 'X is on Signal, say hey!' notifications. Obviously this was very disconcerting, as the first thought was that people on the other end might be receiving similar notifications. Is that the case, or are they &quot;one-way&quot; in the sense that you only receive notifications for numbers that you already have in your contacts? Surely Signal isn't leaking contact details to third-party users... This seemed to be very un-Signal like behavior and the person in question was concerned enough to consider discontinuing use of the app. I wanted to find out more regarding this behavior beforehand, as this issue is very unclear. Perhaps there is some way to opt-out of this (or preferably make it opt-in)? Some clarification would be much appreciated! Thanks for the awesome product by the way.

		Hi, Signal 3.9.0 introduces location messages. While generating such a location message the phone starts GPS service of the device. Typically position precision increases after several seconds in several steps. But Signal stays at the very first (inaccurate) position. Other messengers like Telegram keep track on position updates and always auto-snap to the newest (typically most accurate) position. In Signal I have to press the center button several times before sending the location message in order to send an exact position. It would be great if Signal supports auto-snap like other messengers.

		Drafts are currently difficult to find because they are not distinguished from other messages and disappear after phone power down. Proposed Solution: (1) Filter drafted messages to be viewed together and (2) store incomplete messages similarly as stored messages so that they are retained through power loss.

Signal is my default SMS app. I attempted to answer the SMS and got an error when sending (I still did not add this contact to my address book). Tapping on the failed outgoing message I saw the lock symbol for Signal messages in the lower right corner of the message bubble. When I try to resend, it fails again as the recipient is not a Signal user. Then returning to the conversation, the default method for messaging is correctly an unsecured SMS.

		Device info: LG e970, Cyanogenmod 11 build M10, Signal 3.8.1 App state: Push registered, SMS enabled, linked with one device (desktop Chrome) I received the same message in a group chat 5 times. I saw the same messages on both my desktop Signal instance and on my Android Instance. Android Debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/248503469b6b3aed4dc4 Desktop Debug log: https://gist.github.com/02bbbe32ad48ac10061e Person on other end of conversation (whose message was sent multiple times) said: &quot;I was in the subway and lost reception. Msg didn't send initially. Had to resend. You have to individually hit send to each person in the group; I hit resend to each person, 5 people total.&quot; Seems like even though the app prompts the user whose message was not sent to each person in a group conversation, one &quot;re-send&quot; works within a group.

		Hello there i noticed that in SMSSecure (i know where i am) there is kind of a glitch that, if you send out a key-exchange message to a non-SMSSecure user and sayed User forwards you that exact Message, the communication is afterwards shown to be encrypted which it most-likely is but with the own publickey which will result in more gibberish being send to the user. I am not sure if this affects Signal too, which it probably won't as the server automatically checks if sayed user has indeed Signal installed but a basic routine that checks if the send back publickey at key-exchange is indeed not identical to ones own publickey would be appreciated. Truth be told i am by no means a Cryptographer and can not estimate how trivial if at all such a routine would be to be implemented and even if this is something you consider important as it is a probably a rather rare occasion. I am just forwarding this to the crypto-guys which created the underlying protocol in the first place Greetings, Henry Kratom

		Whenever I want to sent a Signal message to more then one person, I need to setup a new group (btw: which is not the best UX imho, a more email like way might be better with being able to have many TO or CC recipients). I already have about a dozen groups now. Unlike the single Signal contacts, that are visible when I tap on the &quot;write new message&quot; button there is no overview of currently existing groups. There is only the initial history of recent messages but for not so often used groups these vanish there quickly and are then hard to find. Maybe there should be an extra tab on the contacts list overview. Or just all groups listed in between the Signal lists and SMS contacts would do too.

		Id like to be able to use signal on my wifi tablet without needing a phone #. Also, requiring a user to sign up with a unique identifier like a phone number seems to be like the first obvious identifier we would not want to require a user to submit if we are interesting in anonymity. Snowden talks about unique identifier databases. Bleep allows account creation with just a key pair. My request is not to require the user to submit identification information on a device that tracks their physical location, can be pinpointed by a stingray, and is most likely directly linked to their billing records. It also makes it a pain to keep a signal account portable when a user changes phone numbers. If a user wants to submit their phone number so that their contacts can locate them that way, fine, but as a requirement its a total game killer.

		I think in most areas of the world OpenStreetMap provides better and more detailled map data than Google Maps. Also there are many providers you can get map data and have an osm map underneath if osm.org or nominatim alone don't work for how location sharing is implemented today. i I would love to see more love for non proprietary stuff. 👍 3

		At the moment there is only this text in the entry field for sending text which says &quot;send unsecured SMS&quot; or &quot;Send Signal message&quot;. When I open a chat there should be something really obvious to see if I am safe to write something or if I have to be careful. I also noticed once that there was the wrong text. It said &quot; Send unsecured SMS&quot; in a preciously encrypted Signal chat, after restarting the app the text was correct. But again, I think security/privacy is the most important feature this app has to offer. Users should see on first sight if they are on an encrypted channel. Also the contact list UI should be more clear about the difference of SMS vs. Signal chat.

I am using a rooted N910T, running RAPTURE 6.0, Android version 5.0.1 This is a new issue. I have uninstalled Signal, wiped both Cashes, rebooted and reinstalled Signal. The issue still persists. Also I am unable to export a backup to storage with the same error stated above. No new apps have been installed or removed between Signal functioning correctly and the appearance of this issue.

		Hi The guardianproject develops an ecosystem called Ripple. Ripple is used to define actions in apps that trigger when the owner of the phone gets in danger and pushes a panic button. SMSSecure for example hides itself when the panic button is triggered. It would be nice if Signal also would support this (hiding/locking the app, sending predefined messages to trusted contacts etc.) https://guardianproject.info/2016/01/12/panickit-making-your-whole-phone-respond-to-a-panic-button/

		I've had a couple cases today of where I was using the desktop client 0.1.6 and when I woke up my phone (wasn't off, just the screen was off) all the messages came flooding into my phone's signal instance. Not sure if that's intended behavior but it can get extensive if the conversation was a bunch of messages which do tend to be longer due to the freedom of typing on a normal keyboard. https://gist.github.com/5dc02749edad36c2060f

		I just did a factory reset and imported a plaintext backup. Then I noticed that a group I belong to shows only my own messages. All messages from other members are displayed in their individual conversations, not in the group they were originally sent to. Before the reset I made a plaintext backup and left the group. After the reset I imported the backup and had another member add me to the group again. New messages are displayed correctly, it's just the history from the backup that's slightly messed up. After noticing the problem I tried deleting all conversations and importing the backup again but the group history is still spread out across the conversations of the group members. Here is the link to the debug log submitted after the second import: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cc20a61ee143dca2e113 I am also using the Signal Desktop beta. The registered devices seem to keep their own version of the history, even if you re-register, so obviously I did not have to import a backup there. All messages in the group and the conversations with individual contacts are displayed properly on my desktop machines. 👍 1

		If a user unregisteres from Signal but did not leave a group, the user will stay in this group forever and you will get an error for every message you send to that group. I suggest that the all groups of a user should be automatically updated when he unregisters. There are many similar issues but not the same I think (#4550 , #2408 , WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop#448). I fear that this might be an issue for the server because the clients shouldn't do this(?)

		Hi @moxie0, on poor network conditions I often see that Signal indicates a failed delivery while some group members have received the message. Signal does not indicate which group member have received the message and which not. Re-sending leads to some group members receiving the message with multiple copies. In order to avoid such issues it should be possible to implement a solution based on the following principle: Indicate the server that a message to x group members is prepared to be sent Transfer all encrypted messages (for each participant) to the server The server waits until messages for each participant have been received The server delivers the messages Found with Signal 3.9.1.

		I am registered using my German cell number, but I am currently in New Zealand. When I receive a message from someone, it usually shows up as a local number, e.g. 021/1234567. If I reply to this message, an SMS is sent to +49 21/1234567, that is, Signal prefixes the number with my default country code, not the country code of the country in which I am currently logged on. Thanks, martin

		Hello! I've installed the Signal app just a few days ago on a Huawei P8 Lite device (Android 5.0.1) and sadly I'm experiencing a bug with notifications, namely: I don't see any notifications about new incoming messages. Only after I manually open the app, see if any new messages were sent. As you can imagine that's a pretty tough bug. Any ideas how to fix it? Other details: notifications for other messaging apps (Viber, What's App) are working all fine. The notifications are turned on in the Signal's settings. Signal is marked as a protected app in the device's settings + notifications for Signal are enabled in the phone's notification center. I was using a Wi-Fi connection to send/receive messages.

		When one person sends a message it appears correctly on my pebble, But when another person sends a message it appears as &quot; sent a message&quot; (paraphrasing). It only fixes its self after one person's messages are marked as read, than the right message suddenly appears on my watch. Pebble doesn't require any special notifications, but I think signal's long notifications are giving it problems

		Android 5.1 Signal 3.9.1 (also observed on previous versions - can't be more specific). https://gist.github.com/anonymous/291abefd9fa914074d60 If notification sound is set to &quot;None&quot; and &quot;In-conversation notifications&quot; are turned on Signal will crash whenever you receive a message while having the conversation open. This only occurs when the conversation the message is a part of is currently open. It doesn't occur if a different conversation is open or if Signal is in the background. When you re-open the app the message that caused the crash will display properly. This affects both Signal conversations and regular SMS conversations with Signal as the SMS client.

		I have just been added to the Signal Desktop Beta and added my computer to Signal on my Android device. After scanning the QR-Code of my desktop I get a screen that asks me to accept that my Desktop can read my messages and post messages in my name. This screen uses a white background and light grey text and is very hard to read. I assume this is related to the dark theme, that I use and looks fine if you use the light/white theme. Probably you just need to adapt either background or text color for the dark theme.

		This is a duplicate of #4338 as this issue was already closed. See also maybe related issues I pointed out there. In short: If Signal already &quot;knows&quot; phone numbers of contacts, it doesn't resync with the phone contacts in case they're deleted or changed. I had for some reason multiple local phone contacts. To get rid of them, I deleted all my contacts from my phone and resynced them with DavDroid from my server. Since then Signal hasn't changed any of my contacts to add them as a Signal user. I'm running Signal 3.9.1 on Android 5.1.1 (CM 12.1) on a rooted device. It seems that Signal doesn't check the contacts anymore for already known numbers. Things I tried: Sync Signal via Settings -&gt; Accounts; refresh contacts in Signal itself. When I display only Signal contacts, none of the former Signal contacts are shown. In fact only my own contact shows up. I can also confirm that this happened on a non-rooted Samsung Galaxy S4 mini running Android 4.4 and Signal 3.9.1. There the contacts had been deleted and resynced with Google. The only &quot;solution&quot; which helped to add Signal users in contacts again was to reinstall the app.

		This is how Signal currently looks when texts are covered: This is what Google messenger does when texts are covered: As you can see, a shadow appears on the bottom of the message area on Google messenger, and not on Signal. This bottom shadow serves two purposes: to visually communicate the presence of later messages and to provide consistency with the shadow on the action bar. It would be great if this could be added to Signal.

I propose a flag be introduced to the image picker that would cause Signal on BOTH sides of the conversation mask the image until tapped. Tapping the image again would re-mask it. Implementation details could include a configuration option to always display images.

		Hi, Text message is not sent to the Signal users, if there is no internet connection, e.g. imagine if you are abroad and have no internet data roaming plan, I would expect Signal to send ordinary smsm messages to the Signal users. Sth like it works in iMessage: no internet, then send normal sms after a while. Now, if I am in roaming and Signal is default app for messaging, I cannot send any text messages to the people that have Signal app. How the app was designed to handle messages between people with Signal accounts when no internet connection?

		It would be a great feature if one could delete all stored media files which are older than a specific time. My problem is that my phone has a small internal storage and i have no possibility to delete a bunch of images (e.g. from group chats) at once. I hope someone understands what i mean.

		Hi Sometimes I encounter a strange behaviour: When I get a message, I enter my phones pin code to unlock it. Than I end up in the conversation with the contact that sent me the message and I can read most of the conversation. Only the message that just arrived is replaced with &quot;Encryption in progress&quot; (or something similar. In German it sais &quot;Entschlüsselung läuft. Bitte warten&quot;). I should add, that the Signal should be locked when this happens. It just did not ask for the password. When I close Signal and open it again, I'm prompted to enter the password and only then I can see the message that did arrive. At the moment I'm using the websocket fork of Signal, but I don't think this is caused by the fork. If you say it is, feel free to close this issue. For the record, the issue I opened in the forks repo can be found here: JavaJens#58 I'm on CopperheadOS based on AOSP and my phone has no GApps installed.

		Can you update your SSL certificate as it is very weak. I am not meaning the fact that it is not CA signed as you are using certificate pinning which is more secure. Things like being vulnerable to the POODLE attack and other things. It explains more in the link. https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=textsecure-service.whispersystems.org

		Hi, I just updated Signal for Android and I keep getting an error message: &quot;Update Google Play Services/Signal won't run unless you update Google Play Services.&quot; The trick is that I pretty much disabled all Google stuff on my phone. The error also has an Update button that does nothing.Do I really need Google PS? It seems that I can send messages and receive messages but I get this error each time I start the phone. My impression whas that other privacy minded people are like me and avoid Google stuff as much as they can. What do do now? Downgrade? Is there a workaround for this? Thank you!

		Make it possible to use Signal and register to a server without the need of a phone number. E.g. the idea would be to mirror what Threema is currently doing where you have an ID and you link either your phone number and/ or your e-mail address. Or nothing - you're still able to use the server without providing that data. But...it would make it easier for people to use Signal together if they, for example, only know each others e-mail. Is something like this on the roadmap? And if it isn't, can I put it there? :) Thanks for listening.

		I'm sorry for the lack of technical detail here, but just wanted to open an issue to start to address this. Messages are being sent (or received -- I can't tell which end the error is on) multiple times and it always seems to be three times. There are 4 participants in the group convo, all of them are using the most recent Play version of Signal-Android, and two participants are additionally using the Signal Chrome extension. If there is anything I can do to help debug, feel free to let me know.

		I'm regularly outside of data zones but would still like to communicate with people. Especially when not it's an emergency. It's happened a couple of times now that Signal prevents me from sending a text when an update is required and I'm without access to the internet. This is pretty poorly thought out. It also just blocks the message from being sent - you only see the warning on the inbox list, rather than on the message list - without giving any indication why the message wasn't sent (when looking at the message thread). This is for ordinary messages to people who don't use Signal and thus don't have encrypted texts. Instead of preventing the message being sent, how about warning the user that their signal app is insecure every time they try updating the message.

		Hi, I factory reset my phone and installed Signal... and I reinstalled Signal multiple times now. The registration process is without problem... If I don't set Signal as the default SMS app, it shows no contacts whatsoever, allthough I resynced every possible account on the phone multiple times. If I set Signal as the default SMS app, it shows every contact twice (once from the google account and once from the whatsapp account, I think), allthough the rest of the phone handles identical entries without a problem. Also Contacts who write me still appear as phone numbers only and not in any way with a name, neither in groups nor in the chat overview nor in single chats. In either case: Groups where I am part of pop up when someone writes something in them, but they have cryptic names in popups (textsecure_group!1c20d...) and are named Unnamed Group inside the App. I can't reply in these groups, the keyboard dosn't even open. Also showing Group Members gives an empty Popup. This is by far not the first time I have Killer Issues with Textsecure/Signal (broken chats that can't be resolved, Contacts Syncing, allways broken Groups after reinstall (yes this is by far not the first time I'm having that issue, just the completely broken contacts are my main Issue right now)), Which saddens me because this is otherwise just an awesome Product and with Desktop support would replace 2 other messaging apps at once for me (of which I have about 5 at the moment). I seriously believe there are enough people that sent you debug logs and everything on similiar or the same issues, but if you need some I can provide them... with or without SMS enabled.

		Why does signal place arbitrary limitations on what filetypes can be sent? It's ridiculous. A file is a file. Signal should not be interested in what files I'm sending, it's supposed to be private? For example it refused to send a PDF, zip, 7z and so on... :/

		Contact list displays names with accents in the wrong order resulting in people named &quot;Álvaro&quot; being sorted after &quot;Zacarías&quot; (not able to attach image at the moment). I think COLLATE LOCALIZED in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/contacts/ContactsDatabase.java (line 150) will do the trick but i'm not a programmer. According to what I've found: [LOCALIZED] It instructs SQLite to sort non-ASCII characters appropriately. Chars with diacritics (some call them accents) have higher byte codes than the character Z, so a plain ASCII sort wouldn't fit to many foreign languages. For example, the capital A char's byte code is 0x41 and the capital Z char's is 0x5A. Then we have the Á (capital A accute) which code in Unicode is 0x00C1. So a plain byte code sort would result the Á to be after the Z. But in languages that have this kind of characters the convention is to put those with diacritics as if they didn't have the diacritic. So the Á should be together with the plain A, at least before B. And to illustrate, we have below a list of names sorted using their bytecode: Brenda
Debby
George
Álvaro
Érico
 Now using the COLLATE LOCALIZED it would sort by the &quot;base&quot; of the character: Álvaro
Brenda
Debby
Érico
George&quot;
 Thank you very much for your great work.

		If you press the audio button in the attachment screen, you get asked, if you want to add a file from storage or record something. In this window you can select an option to always use the selected app (I know that this is a system dialog). This leads to the point, where some contacts can't send me audio recordings, because they made that choice a long time ago. Signal should offer a button to always record a new message like you can always make a new photo with the camera.

		I have installed signal in a secondary user profile (Android 5.1.1, Signal 3.9.1) and enabled signal as default SMS app, as well as enabled that profile to make calls and send sms.Signal is not installed for the primary user (phone owner). I verified that the system SMS app is receiving SMS fine, however, as soon as I switch to signal as the default SMS app, I no longer receive SMS on that profile. If I switch back to the primary user, the SMS is there. Unless I am missing something important, I don't see why signal should not be able to handle this case, e.g. if a user wants to use signal with a different Google account and/or sync contacts from a different source than the main account (my case). This is the log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6e8bb5eadfba96dbe8ba I get this, I assume that indicates an incoming SMS: W/SMSListener( 8759): Got SMS broadcast...
 however, signal does not act on it apparently, though I cannot see an obvious error message off-hand. Another log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ab72cc595bdb3212f106 This time, there is the following: W/SMSListener( 8759): Got SMS broadcast...
W/ResourceType( 8759): Found multiple library tables, ignoring...
 I have the feeling I saw the second message quite often in correlation with this when I tested it.

		Dear Madam or Sir, Unfortunately Signal contains a bug that makes it unusable for me. For me there are many situations in which a message is not received: -Not send due to missing online connection by myself -Not received due to missing online connection by receiver -Not received due to uninstalled Signal without un-registering the device of the receiver It would be more than helpful if Signal would notify me in these situations (e.g. after 30 seconds) so that I can decide to wait or to call/SMS the receiver. I’m aware that the one or two check marks show this information, but in practice people don’t pay attention to this detail and assume that the message was send. Best regards, MH2016s

When I change it to the correct one I'm getting the verification SMS but the app shows: Connectivity error. Signal was unable to connect to the server. Some possible problems include: No network connectivity Restrictive firewall. Obviously I'm connected with both WiFi and 3G. Same happens when I'm only on WiFi and 3G.

		Sorry to post again. But I was wondering why you don't want to add an option to manually link devices? If you are too busy I can figure it out and create a pull request. I just don't want to go through the effort for it to be denied for unknown reasons. I imagine there are others with broken camera's that can't link their desktops. 👍 1

		I cannot use Signal-Android on tablets, I.e.the Pixel C. Assume that this is because of lack of cellular/SMS capabilities, but with the introduction of the desktop client it seems there is a way to do multi device setups supporting devices without a cellular modem/SMS capabilities.

		It would be nice to be able to long press the phone icon in a signal conversation to issue a 'normal' (i.e. unencrypted) call, just like it is currently possible to send an unencrypted SMS. As Signal calls for me still have a high latency/not very good voice quality I often find myself having to switch application from Signal to my contact list to be able to call my Signal-using contacts. Regarding the quality of calls, are you looking for additional servers/ressources in Europe (Switzerland for example)? Thanks a lot for this great application!

		I've been using TextSecure/Signal for a while now and want to get more involved with the project. I figured adding fingerprint sensor app unlock support for the Android app would be a good first project. Before jumping into implementation, I found Issue #4439, where someone requested fingerprint app unlock as an alternative to passphrase, which was closed as wontfix. Was the reasoning for rejecting this feature request due to feature parity with iOS, placing trust in the OS's fingerprint store and authentication, privacy or security concerns, or software testing concerns? I'm not sure if the reasoning from Issue #420 significantly intrudes on the security levels I suggest below, especially when combined with exponential delays on failed attempts and database wipe after too many failed attempts within a period of time. This comes down to giving the user a choice of convenience and security, which I assume is why the no-passphrase option has not been removed yet. I was wondering if I implemented fingerprint app unlock if the Open Whisper team would be interested. Requiring both a passphrase and fingerprint is more secure than either one. In a public setting with wandering eyes, a fingerprint is more secure than a passphrase. Fingerprint sensor support would also allow quicker message checking while keeping Signal in a lock-after-5 minutes state. Here's what I was thinking of adding to the Settings menu always unlocked unlock with passphrase unlock with fingerprint or passphrase require passphrase every X hours (passphrase would be required after 3 fingerprint unlock attempts, and after any device reboot) unlock with passphrase and fingerprint (requires both to unlock the phone every time it is locked) erase all conversation history after Y failed unlock attempts (any combination of fingerprint and passphrase) Signal would use the Android Fingerprint API, using whatever fingers are registered with the OS.

		Because I use signal as my default sms app, sometimes I need to send my signal contacts multiple sms and I don't want to long press the sending button every time I need to send one. I would suggest to put a additional entry in the contact settings. Examples: If they on vacation and disable there mobile data. Or if they lost there phone and need to use there old nokia until they get a new one.

		When tapping into a conversation, the cursor in the typing area matches the pretty signal blue for both secure and normal SMS contacts. I think it'd be a nice touch to have the cursor color match the contact's color. I know this wouldn't be a high priority issue at all but it would be low-hanging fruit for someone who does android programming and wanted to start getting involved with signal development.

		If Desktop resets a session, the remote party will delete all sessions with our number, including any with the Android client. Thus, when the android client receives a synced sent message with its end session flag set, it too should close all sessions with the destination and render the message as Secure session reset. Currently it renders as a normal message and does not delete sessions.

		I can only get to Signal by opening from my home screen favorite/shortcut menu. It is never available in the Recent Apps list. Reproduce: Close all recent apps Open Chrome Press Home Open Signal Press Recent Apps Recent Apps list appears with Chrome. Signal scales/resizes down to fit, but then disappears. If I close all apps and open just Signal, when I press Recent Apps my app list is empty. This may be related to #1037 and is probably related to #3172. Neither describe this exact issue. Could be an unintended result of a workaround for #3172?

		I cannot reply to a contact who joined Signal yesterday using Signal-Android. I can receive encrypted messages just fine, but Signal-Android does not find the user on the server: The input bar reads &quot;Send unsecured SMS&quot; and there is no option to reset the encrypted connection. A lock is shown next to the messages I received from the contact, and the messages sync correctly to Signal-Desktop, so the encrypted connection seems functional. It seems that the registration is a bit mucked up, though. When I try to reply with Signal-Desktop, I get the following lines in the log: PUT https://textsecure-service-ca.whispersystems.org:4433/v1/messages/+[REDACTED]838
PUT https://textsecure-service-ca.whispersystems.org:4433/v1/messages/+[REDACTED]838 404 Error

 I can't provide a meaningful log for Signal-Android because it doesn't even let me reply to the conversation. The (redacted) phone number never shows up in the log either. I can privately send you mine my contact's number if you want to investigate the registration on the server or anything.

		Signal 3.9.1 When I have no unread signal messages and I receive a message, I will get a notification which contains the sender's name and the message. When I have unread signal messages and I receive a message from a different contact, I will get a notification which shows &quot;Most recent from: &quot; and does not contain the text of the most recent message. Maybe this bothers me more than others due to my use case, but as I use a pebble which receives the text of notifications, this means that whenever I receive a message and I have another unread message, I will not be able to see the text of the newest message on my pebble. It will only receive the text of the new &quot;Most recent from &quot; message. I'd like for there to be a notification setting to turn off this &quot;summary&quot; notification.

		I've run into a weird little issue : my phone's LED indicator is not working as part of &quot;new message&quot; notifications. The sound and the vibration do work, but the LED does not, which results in very poor usability : since without the blinking LED, having missed the initial sounds and vibrations, there is then no way to tell, by just looking at the phone, whether or not there are new messages except by unlocking the screen - so in order to not miss messages one has to constantly unlock the screen and check for a notification in the status bar. The LED used to work fine with text messages prior to the installation of Signal. It still works correctly with WhatsApp. Signal seems to be the only app where the LED is malfunctioning. Here's my debug log : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a4338e57a0ee8ddfc0a3 . I submitted this issue as a support request (ID 1667) back on December 13, but have since despaired of getting any reply and so decided to create an issue here.

		This isn't important, so I am asking before creating a PR. Is there interest (chance of merge?) in adding additional text-only emoticons? There's plenty of room in the Signal keyboard emoticon tab, it's actually barren compared to the rest. Would be simple to add to EmojiPages.java. Examples:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

 ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ

 Far more complex option: Adding the ability for users to add custom items to the emoticon tab.

		Often time I have to open the app for Signal to poll new messages. Basically the app do not fetch for days and it is only when you manually open the app that it actually fetch all the messages. It happens on many devices, actually many android devices of my relatives. It happens more often with miui/xiaomi devices which is known to often kill background services for performances purposes. It happens since months and I thought it would be a common bug. Other app do get notifications.

		I searched for the answer but couldn't find it so I thought I'd ask here. Probably this has been answered somewhere already, though. Is it possible to verify that the APK distributed at Google Play has been built from the exact source code in this repository? I suppose this would require that the source code can be compiled in a reproducible way. Thanks for any help!

		Dear Whispter Systems, first of all I would like to express my HUGE appreciation for your product !!! I have been testing a LOT of apps and your is by FAR the best out there !!! I absolutely admire the CRYSTAL CLEAR call quality, it is really outstanding! Although your app is almost perfect, I would kindly like to ask you to take a look at one issue, which troubles me and if this gets fixed, I would pronounce your product as PERFECT !!! When speaking on Signal, if somebody tries to call me by phone, he simply gets a voice message that I am unable to take his call and I just get an entry in the missed calls list. This is not OK, as I need to call back that person. I would like to be informed about incoming calls and have the possibility to pause or drop the Signal call and to take the normal phone call. Please kindly make it the default behaviour or provide an option that would enable this behaviour. Many thanks !!

		Hi, since the last update I've found a problem with the signal app. When I receive messages, they appear in the notification bar on top of the phone but they don't show up in the main windows of the app, neither do they show up when I directly press &quot;reply&quot; from the notification bar. The problem occurs only after the latest update to 3.10. I already uninstalled and reinstalled signal - same issue. I confirmed that it is not a problem of the sending phone; that works fine with other contacts. Device: Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Android: 4.4 Debug log: debug log Signal is standard SMS app. Steps to reproduce: send message to the phone. Any help possible there?

		In certain circumstances, messages are sent but not from within the signal app. For example, when you decline a call with a message or send bulk messages with other apps. Signal only checks the local message database on first install, and messages that appear there later are ignored. If I decline a call with a message, it appears in the stock messaging app, but not in signal. Not sure if this is a feature request or a bug fix, but signal should show non-native outgoing messages, and also display delivered status.

		The graphical symbol (pencil) of the floating action button in the conversation list doesn't make much sense. A pencil usually represents writing. But tapping that floating action button opens Signal's contact list (and is btw currently the only way to achieve that), which is not very intuitive. &quot;Writing&quot; in that context could be interpreted as e. g. a) writing a new message within an existing conversation (i. e. in the conversation list) or b) starting a new conversation (i. e. in the contact list). One the other hand, a plus sign (&quot;+&quot;) represents adding, like in adding a new conversation. Within the context of the conversation list, I'm not aware of any other imaginable interpretations, so a plus sign is not ambiguous regarding its purpose. So in conclusion, I suggest that the pencil symbol is replaced by a plus sign. An alternative possibility would be using that &quot;contacts&quot; symbol pictured below (after all, tapping the button opens Signal's contact list). CC: @agrajaghh 👍 1

		Status bar color is lighter than the conversation color. That apply on every color. I dislike this, and it's harder to use in low light. Edit (copy/paste of a later message in the ticket) Oh, and on Lollipop you usually get the same color, this is why i opened this bug in the first place. I don't know what is meant by design, but Lollipop and Marshmallow are not consistent. So it's your choice to assign the bug to one or the other. Please consider every other message in the ticket as the main one.

(The overlay appeared by sliding down, so I want to swipe it up) add a close button next to raise/open button (but that's ugly) Device info: Nexus 5, OmniRom 6.0.1, Signal 3.10.0

		https://gist.github.com/1799b056d685efc3f6f5 - I stopped the call when it wouldn't work. android 5.1.1 LG Leon lmy47v Signal v 3.10.0 https://gist.github.com/ac01de5814a9b7d4bc65 - I let it go until it stopped itself It used to make calls fine to another Signal user, but within the last update or two (I don't use it often) the calls stopped working correctly. It still sends texts fines. Someone with the identical phone can make a call to me that works fine, but when I call out it simply rings and won't connect.

		Hi, I've searched for references to PIN in existing issues and was unable to find any existing references. If there is one, I apologise in advance but I wasn't able to locate any. I use the passphrase option to lock the app (privacy settings) and love the feature but would like it if there was an alternative option to have it as a passcode/PIN instead of a passphrase. Keep the passphrase for first use after a restart of the phone and for encryption, etc. but for inactivity timeout a PIN entry in the same style as Nine (email client) and Telegram would be awesome. Where you set a PIN. It provides the buttons so that keyboard isn't required (handy especially if keyboard is recording strokes for autocorrect, etc.) and no need to press &quot;return/enter&quot; - it just unlocks if correct PIN is entered. Cheers, Brettus Examples below:

		Sorry to clutter things up with what may be a support issue here, but I've been unable to register Signal Private Messenger (3.10.0): App installed (and reinstalled) from the Play store. The same errors occur using both mobile data and WiFi. Google Play Services are current. The email address for the play account is current. Push Notification Fixer appears to work. Android is 4.3. Phone is a Verizon Samsung Galaxy SIII. Since I can't register, I can't get to the internal debug log generation. An adb logcat output is at https://gist.github.com/bearfacts/5f6c4eb5b2bab2ac6f71 Any assistance or even a simple message that my issue does not merit developer consideration would be appreciated.

		Backup is disabled, and there is no full backup in the app. Any chance of publishing an APK that is interchangeable with the main APK (signing my own won't do the job) that allows backup? Then at least I'll be able to use Helium again. Or create a non-secure local backup? Or remove keys from backup, enable backup again, and add a 'share/send keys' option?

		I just installed the latest Signal (3.9.1), and installed it on GFs phone as well. Then I text her and she didn't get my text until she turned her data on the next day. This used to work so well, especially in our country where mobile data is finite and very expensive and where we may not want to have our data enabled for fear of further tracking/random apps eating your cap. Sending messages over data is great and all I understand the metadata security implications of SMS but surely it is better to send metadata in the clear, and the message encrypted, than sending both in the clear? Seemed like a great way to backport encryption to older technologies. The other great thing about the app was that you could replace the shitty stock SMS apps that come with smartphones with this beautiful application and get encryption to people who have the same app, over data or SMS. I read over issue #2847 and they seemed to completely discount this whole user base and the above use cases... pretty sad. I don't want to have to go back to the shitty stock SMS app :(

		Hello, I from Australia can text my friend in Macau China both are using Signal on Android 3.10.0. But when I call the other party, Signal rings for a while but then it says &quot;Call End&quot; and call failed. Same thing happens when the other party initiates the call. Attach is a debug log https://gist.github.com/d57c2f884b3726a8dce9 for call initiated by me that fails. Hope this will help to unlock the mystery. Could this be because that the other party in Macau is using a network on a university campus that is blocking the require ports? Skype to Skype works perfectly and it seems strange that about a brief chat on Signal we have to flick over to Skype for voice. My Signal using voice works wonderfully to US without trouble. Thanks.

		I am using signal on Android as sms app. As the database for the sms gets encrypted I can't seem to find a way to count my monthly used sms.

		When receiving an SMS, the &quot;conversation screen&quot; with the SMS has no &quot;delete&quot; option in menu. To delete the conversation, one has to go back to the Conversation List screen, long-press an item to enter Batch selection mode, and click the delete button. This is very cumbersome. There should be a delete option in the menu. The native Android messaging app provided by Google already has such an option.

		The recent commit 25d7931 uses the string &quot;Signal system database import is complete.&quot; (I am aware that @haffenloher just made the already existing string translatable and replaced &quot;TextSecure&quot; with &quot;Signal&quot; - so not pointing fingers). &quot;Signal system database&quot; doesn't make any sense to me, i. e. having &quot;Signal&quot; and &quot;system&quot; in the same expression imho contradicts itself. There are a) Signal's (encrypted) database and b) Android's central database for SMS/MMS, which is used by other messaging apps. What this string means to describe is the process of importing from (b) to (a), i. e. from the system database to Signal's database. So this really should read &quot;System database import is complete.&quot;, correct? While I'm at it, I'd rather suggest &quot;Import of the system's SMS/MMS database has been completed.&quot; (this assumes that this string is the text body of a dialog - more space for more detailed info available - while &quot;Import complete&quot; is the dialog's title) or &quot;Import of system database completed.&quot; if something shorter is needed.

		Non-international phone number are not supported (contact does not appears during a search) A mobile phone number can appear in multiple way here: +54 9 (area) (number) 0054 9 (area) (number) (area) 15 (number) (if inside Argentina, whatever the caller area code is) 15 (number) [if both numbers share the same area] Where &quot;9&quot; is the magic number for mobile (equivalent to the local &quot;15) and &quot;1&quot; for land-lines &quot;15&quot; is the magic number for mobile (number) contains 6 to 8 digits (area) can (optionally?) be prefixed by a trunk code of value &quot;0&quot;, eg: 223 == 0223, or 11 == 011 (don't know about the cases of the trunk code being mandatory) The area is somehow part of the number (since the number is registered for a unique and given area). But it can be omitted if calling from a device from the same area (similarly to the country code 54 which can be omitted if we call from a national device) Most contact's phone numbers are registered using the 4th scheme excepting contacts from other regions. The Android API already provides the country code. From this, it may be possible to know the area code (depending on the Android API?) From the above two it should be fairly easy to map phones number from one scheme to another. I don't know if heavy modifications are needed, but I could at least provide a PR to add test case. https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/test/unitTest/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/PhoneNumberFormatterTest.java ? [edit] It seems that most of the country-specific logic should be handled by the libphonenumber, and more specifically https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/libphonenumber/test/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/data/PhoneNumberMetadataProtoForTesting_AR If it turns to be true, then what keeps the different notation to be understand as a unique contact?

		Some of my contacts use Signal to send me pictures of their lives. i want to store them permanently rather than in Signal. Currently I have to tap each picture individually, then the save button, then answer a question, the tap back, rinse and repeat. I would like to propose a more efficient way for this scenario. Different options could be considered: a) extend the &quot;all images&quot; view to allow selecting and storing all pictures at once. b) an option to automatically store all incoming pictures in a folder on the sd-card. I'm sure other options might be perceivable. Thanks for your consideration.

		Phone numbers from the Faroe Islands have length of 6 digits. The land-code is +298. If I enter my number into the app, f.x +298 123456, the app will return the connectivityFailureLayout. However, if I type my number with a zero at the end (+298 1234560) it will work. This is not pratical, as all my contacts will not be able to contact me encrypted, because I always will reply with my normal number, and not the one with a zero at the end. I'm searching around in the source code, and when debugging the application, I find that the problem is maybe not in the app itself, but in the online service. Here's one log from the app: Opening URL: https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/v1/accounts/sms/code/+298123456 And then the app receives a warning: org.whispersystems.textsecure.api.push.exceptions.NonSuccessfulResponseCodeException: Bad response: 400 Bad Request And if add a zero to the end, the 400 Bad Request error goes away. I suspect you have a minimum requirement for at least 7 digits to be typed, but could you edit that to 6?

		I have a few contacts who have issues with delayed messages. (I'm aware of the multiple threads on the topic.) However, especially with those contacts, the extended info &quot;send time&quot; and &quot;delivered time&quot; per message were very helpful. (The wording might be different; I use the German version.) They were only displayed for sent messages, not for recieved, and I was rather looking forward to get them on both. Anyhow, now I don't even get the &quot;delivered&quot; info for sent messages anymore. Is this a server issue/feature/bug? Because I do not recall a Signal update since it still worked.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description While looking into #5294, I noticed that the subhint in ComposeText.java has a hardcoded string:     setHint(transport.getComposeHint(), transport.getSimName().isPresent() ? &quot;From &quot; + transport.getSimName().get() : null);
 This should be extracted to a string resource for localization. Signal version: latest master, 24d103d, 3.13.0

		Steps to reproduce: Register the number 123-456-7890 on phone # 1. On phone # 2, add 123 456 7890 as a contact in Signal. Transfer the number/SIM card on phone # 1 to phone # 2. At this point, phone # 2 will have it's own number, 123 456 7890, stuck at the top of Signal's contact list. Unlike the previous bug reports, unregistering the number is not an option as it is a valid Signal number. (But obviously I don't want to message my own phone.) I've reset the session, removed and unlinked 123 456 7890 from my contact list with no luck. Related: #682, #4678, #274, #439

		I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I have received a message from a contact yesterday night. Later on, I sent a few messages, all of which were not received yet to this contact (just one tick mark). Today, after almost 13 hours after the last contact's message, I've received the same exact message again from the contact, with the same yesterday timestamp, even though between those two repeated messages I can see my messages with later timestamps. Seems a server-side issue since the contact is still offline. Steps to reproduce Sorry this is the first time it happens and seems random enough to reproduce.

		Hello, please apologize if my post is not appropriate here. I like Signal very much, I have installed it on both of my Phones - a Samsung phone on Android and on my iPhone. And I am really puzzled by the big differences in the app on both OS. I could even say that it almost looks like a different app. Here I would like to accent on 2 things: Some time ago, I had raised a question, that while speaking on Signal on my Android phone, it is not possible to put the Signal call on hold, in order to take the phone call. I have got an answer, that it is not possible. On my iPhone though, I was surprised, that this works! I was speaking on Signal, I received a phone call and I was able to take the phone call !! Security settings - I was pleased with the many security features offered on Android - it is possible to set a PIN code in order to access the app. I was also delighted about the option to set a number of messages to be kept, which I have set very low, so all the old messages simply go to /dev/zero Both these options are not available on iOS :-/ Even when I enter the settings, they look almost empty, compared to the numerous settings and options on Android... Can you please shortly comment on why it is like that ? Just asking out of curiosity... I hope that the app will further evolve on both platforms and will provide even more features! Thank you for providing this magnificent software for free!! I wish you all the best for the future!

		Today, I wanted to put in touch two people who didn't want to disclose their names. Both have WhatsApp, Telegram and Viber accounts, therefore, it was impossible to share their phone numbers because as soon as they saved phone numbers they could find some data about the other one. So, How can I set a username for account? I think there is no option for it. if I'm right, is there any plan for it?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I tried to get Signal working on BlackBerry's Runtime for Android. Sadly voice calls only partially working. I can call other Signal users but they can't hear my voice. I'm getting a lot of sendto() failed! errors in /dev/log/main. After some further debugging I found that sendto() always fails with error 22 (EINVAL - invalid argument). As far as I understand the code the socket is already connected in RtpSocket.java so a send() should be enough in RtpAudioSender.cpp. I changed sendto() to send() and got voice calls working. I'm not sure if this is a BlackBerry specific issue cause it works with sendto() on pretty any Android device. Steps to reproduce Install Signal on a BlackBerry Install Cobalt's Google Apps follow the instructions on Cobalt's official Google Apps landing page. You need to install Google Account Manager, Blackberry Google ID and Google Play services the Google Play store itself is not needed. Patch and install Signal follow the instructions on How to patch Android Apps depending on Google Maps and Google Play Services. Call a another Signal user. Device info Model: BlackBerry Passport OS v10.3.2.2836 Android version: 4.3.0 Signal version: 3.13.0

		Signal &quot;forcibly&quot; upgrades my conversations. This seems to be intentional, so I totally understand if you close the issue on this basis. I need this functionality because I don't have a data plan. This might seem weird to you, but in my case I just don't need one, generally. I'm currently working around this by using the default Messaging app, but I wish I didn't have to.

		Bug description I've had to reinstall my phone (oneplus2), and I've used titanium backup to conduct that operation. Once the phone was operational again, I restored my apps (including signal) using titanium. Upon reinstallation, signal sent me 200+ 'so and so is on signal' messages, as one would expect to receive when someone joins - except this was for everyone in my phonebook that has signal installed. When I mark the messages read, it pushes them down to me again so that they are 'new'. When I try to delete them, it pushes them to me again. The only thing i can do is sit here with several hundred new, unread messages. I've attempted to uninstall and completely delete all traces of signal from my phone, as well as removing the desktop application to 'start from scratch', but nothing I do seems to tell the server side that it should stop sending me this tidalwave of welcome messages. Steps to reproduce install signal send a few messages make a backup of signal using titanium backup format phone / factory reset re-root, install old rom (i'm using stock oneplus2 roms) install titanium backup restore apps, or even just signal by itself resulting scenario is signal re-pushing welcome messages to you forever. Device info Rooted OnePlus2, on newest stock oxygenOS Rooted, with twrp and supersu signal version newest from google play store as of 3/6/2015 (3.12.0) android version 5.1.1 osxygenOS version 2.2.0 Debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ed19ae2bcd519833fd57

		I would like to present one of our use cases for Signal (on Android): We use the app for sensitive information exchange, but would not only like the communication safe on the communication channel side, but also protected from people having access to our phones. Therefore we have set a password and set the inactivity time out to a low value. Often in a rush you might not be able to lock and close Signal and thus this is done automatically within a minute in our case. There are situations in reality where other people temporarily have access to your phone and therefore locking the app is very important ... Now we would find it very useful additional to the automatic lock after inactivity we could also set an option to automatically close Signal. In theory Signal offers everything to achieve what we need to be sufficiently secure, if there was not bug 3172, which leaves a screenshot in the recent app overview of your communication in some cases on Android &gt;5, which happens regularly to us. An autoclose feature would also work around that problem, as the app is automatically closed after a set time out if we forget to close it. Automatically closing is very sensible from our point of view as it exactly does what automatically locking does: Making sure as much information as possible stays private ... an open signal windows in the recent apps overview is some tiny bit of information we would like to avoid automatically by setting a timeout. Of course if sensitive information exchange happens the user should be sensible enough to make sure he locks and closes the app, but in reality all of us are human and there are situations where auto locking and auto closing saves you a lot of trouble. I think this also fits well with idea of signal being as simple as possible to use. I agree technology can not compensate stupidity of people, but that's not what I am requesting. Furthermore it would compensate bug 3172 really well, as this would not have to rely on the ROM following the rules.

		Hi All, I was thinking that it would be cool to have a popup keyboard that opens in the app only. This would not be a keyboard app for android, really just a series of buttons that are displayed in the app that would allow the user to type &quot;seriously secure content&quot; without being tracked. I know that we could find a keyboard that &quot;doesn't track anything&quot; but it seems much more secure to have a internal keyboard that isn't a keyboard at all. Even if they say they don't track, you can't really be sure, plus, for most of my other activities, I enjoy the auto-correct and predictiveness of Google. Even most of my messages, I don't really have an issue with Google storing the data they store. But if I did want to send something I was worried about Google seeing, having a quick button I could click to open up a keyboard to enter a quick message would be amazing. Websites have done this for years, typically older government sites. They would have a little popup keyboard that you would use your mouse to select they keys to ensure a keylogger wasn't recording your social security number. Seems like a good idea to me, what do you think?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates What about implementing in (distant) future versions p2p-like capabilities when it comes to phone calls, with the central server working as a simple switchboard operator? That would be even more secure and would save bandwidth as well as open possibilities to higher quality calls. The same could work with pictures/audios/videos, with the server taking them on board only if the other party isn't online.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Chat scrolls when new messages are received and you can't catch them to read, and if you get new messages, you will be immediately thrown to that last message and need to scroll up again to see old ones, and so on. Steps to reproduce chat with someone, or in group (this is even worse, because if members in group are active you will not be able to read old messages), try to read old message and let someone write you something while you reading old messages. Device info Model: Nexus 5 and BQ M5 Android version (both): 5.1.1 Signal version: 3.13.1 Releted to: #1211 which is locked and 2 years old. #3955 which is 8 Months old

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal should fall back to periodic update checks when GCM Push doesn't work Steps to reproduce Tried installing Signal on a Motorola RAZR M, with Android 4.4.2 I have a friend with the same model, who also has the same issue with Signal I have followed all the steps here: http://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/213190487-Why-is-there-a-delay-in-receiving-messages- The RAZR M does not have any options for &quot;Phone specific optimisation&quot; When the screen is off, push notifications do not work for Signal messages (but do work for SMS) Only when the screen is unlocked, and the Signal app is opened, new message notifications arrive Expected behaviour There should be a manual option to perform the same routine as opening the app to check for new messages at a defined interval, say every 10 minutes. Messages do arrive, but only when the app is opened. To stop impact to other users for whom GCM Push works properly, this setting should be off by default This would mean that Signal messages are at least delivered eventually, rather than only when opening the app and manually refreshing Device info Model: Motorola RAZR M Android version: 4.4.2 Signal version: 3.13.1

		Since the verification of other peoples keys is very important, I propose adding a visual indicator to the contact display. Something like a badge, or a star or lock symbol. This indicator will be displayed after the user explicitely stated that he had verified the contacts key. This is helpful in keeping track of the contact verification status and also would encourage new users to understand that verifiyng keys is important. Beste regards Henning

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I am not sure if this is a vulnerability, if it's a bug or a &quot;feature&quot;. When using Signal as a default SMS app and enable the locked option, as far as I know, no one should be able to access any received message. However, if you have any two factor-authentication enable on Google (using Google as an example) and try to login to your Google account, you will receive an SMS and Google will automatically read the SMS and authenticate you, without any need of manually having to unlock Signal, copy the authentication code and paste it to Google's prompt. This should probably work with any app that will automatically read any SMS received to authenticate any 2 second-authentication code. This concerns me, because if I have any type of malware listening to my SMS app, it will be able to read any message I receive without worrying if Signal is locked or not. Steps to reproduce Remove your Google account from your Android settings. Make sure Signal is locked and is your default SMS app. Login to your Google Account. Wait for the SMS. Google will automatically authenticate you. Device info Samsung Galaxy S5 running Cyanogen lastest nightly build of KLTE. ** Signal Version: 3.13.1

		Hi, I have a problem with two devices (both Android) which do not sync their keys properly. When communicating with the other device, I can receive messages with Signal, but not answer them. Instead I just get &quot;Recipient has no identity key&quot;. I also cannot view the key of the other person, while my key is synced to the other device. This seems to be a copy of this issue involving iOS: WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS#1048 Removing and re-installing the app did not change the situation.

		If the USERTRUST RSA ssl cert Signal uses is disabled in Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Trusted Certificated, Signal correctly fails to register. However, the message is a generic server connection failure... Technically correct, practically not very helpful. To be honest, I recently disabled all the certs on my phone and started running apps one by one and approving only what needs approving. So far, not a single app did too well in these regards. A few even failed silently... Regardless, even if it's not worth improving on, I figured I should at least put it out there just in case someone runs into some obscure but related issues. I also saw the last few commits touched some elliptic curve cipher related stuff so this might actually be useful one day ;)

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates Description My goal is to verify that the APK distributed on Google Play is executing the code at the commit of the release tag on GitHub. Even though I trust OWS to publish the untampered code, they could be compelled to alter it without revealing it, and it is better to know than to assume. To do the verification, I'm looking at the hash of each file in the APK I get from Google Play and comparing it with the hash of the APK I built myself. In build.gradle a timestamp is populated as a BuildConfig field at build time. This field has millisecond accuracy and is used to expire the binary after 90 days. Due to it changing during every build, classes.dex in the APK has a different hash, so it's impossible to verify the integrity of the code. Proposal I'd like to submit a PR to: change the timestamp to be granular only to the day (1458190800000ms). be replaceable by an environment or system variable. This would allow for easy APK verification. The signing date of the Play APK can be used to determine the build date which can then be replaced during a verification build. The timestamp can still be used to determine when 90 days have gone by and a build has expired. Risks The risk of this feature regressing in the future is fairly high due to the external nature of the verification. This could be mitigated by a build step that performs the verification, or reduced through good commenting. The code I'm using for verification is available here. Signal version: 3.14.1, and master at time of filing. 👍 2

		I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Android apps can choose whether their links open a new tab or overwrite any previous tab the app had opened. Signal should so the former, but does the latter. For example, if a friend sends a link to a newspaper article about how awesome end to end encryption is, and then while I'm reading it I get a message from a restaurant asking me to click a link to confirm my reservation, doing so will overwrite the tab where I was reading the article, requiring me to go back to that conversation, click it again, and then find my place again. This is annoying, and sometimes hard to anticipate (who remembers how they opened a tab four hours ago?) Steps to reproduce click a link in a message you received use the app switcher button to switch back to signal click a different link in a message you received Device info Model: Google/LG Nexus 5X Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.14.2 Solution You need to set EXTRA_CREATE_NEW_TAB. see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Browser.html#EXTRA_CREATE_NEW_TAB for details. I guess if some people find the current behavior preferable, this could be a configuration option, though I really think this is almost always unexpected behavior. I could send a pull request, but: I don't have an appropriate dev environment set up, and so would have to do so without testing, which makes me nervous. I can't actually find where Signal is calling out to the browser.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Feature Request Most apps today offer a filter to narrow down the elements (=Messages) of a list of elements (=Chat) to those matching the flter query. I'm using TS/Signal for many years now and my chats are constantly growing. Meanwhile it is nearly impossible to find Information within the chats manually by scrolling up/down (not heaving a scroll-handle like e.g. in the contacts-app makes this even worse). This is different from a search because a search will need more UI-changes (e.g. search next/prev buttons), a filter will only need a small text-box and will just narrow down the messages of the current chat-list. It would be great to jump into the unfiltered chat to the position of the selected message from the filtered list.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Same as #4266 : I receive only messages when the app is opened. Steps to reproduce It seems, that this always happens, after i update CyanogenMod via Recovery. To fix this, i use the normal way: Simply disable and re-enable &quot;Signal messages&quot; in the advanced settings. Then GCM works. Question: Is there no way to warn the user, like: &quot;GCM is turn off, please re-enable Signal messages in the advanced settings&quot; if he opens signal app. or even better: Check GCM status on first start and auto-re-enable GCM if it's not working.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Enhancement description There are many sharing options in Signal, including sending of images and videos taken from camera or audio files, recorded by another application, but there is no convenient way to send and receive (play in-app) audio recordings, recorded only with the microphone. This is a very useful feature in bad connectivity or harsh audio environments, where live audio call is not an option (a very notable case being a warzone or aftermath of a natural disaster). There are also many markets such as Spain where people use this function on a daily basis. If the description is not evident enough, try to think of it as a &quot;software walkie talkie&quot;, which allows the first Signal user to only press a button in the application (like &quot;push-to-talk&quot; button on a walkie talkie) and it starts recording the audio, which is then compressed with a suitable speech codec and sent via Signal to the receiving user. In this way the talk is not real-time, but it allows for disturbances in the connectivity between the two users and it also allows the second user to listen to the message repeatedly in case of loud audio environment on any side of the conversation. ps: Maybe TextSecure-Server would be a better repository to post this enhancement to, but it doesn't seem too live, and I haven't been able to found the Signal-Server one... If it's necessary, I'll repost this elsewhere, just let me know where.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Since I do not have a phone carrier plan, I use signal to send and receive messages over Wifi connections. This works because I have a VoIP provider with which I was able to go through the voice-based registration procedure (and thank you so much for that!). However, to send and receive SMS messages, I use a different app, which works pretty well. In fact, during the registration process, I did receive the SMS confirmation message - i just wasn't able to use it because Signal didn't intercept it. But that's fine as well because I could work around the problem. My main concern at this point is that I need to consciously switch between my SMS and Signal apps, based on whether or not I know that the user has Signal at all. In fact, I think there's a usability issue there, even for regular user: if Signal has trouble sending SMS messages (e.g. problem with the SIM card, connectivity issues), how does it tell the user? From my point of view here, Signal tries to send the message and I get the &quot;bouncing 3 dots&quot; forever, even though there's no SIM card on the phone and this will never succeed. What I would like would be for Signal to be able to talk to other apps to send and receive insecure SMS messages. I am not sure i clearly understand how the insecure fallback works right now - it doesn't feel like Signal uses the builtin messaging app but talks to the SMS subsystem of Android on itself. Could it be possible to fallback to some other SMS provider? I guess this also applies to competing protocols like Whatsapp or Telegram: what if my contact is not using signal? Could I still use Signal as a unified messaging app? (and coincidentally invite my poor Whatsapp or Telegram user to join Signal!) Note that other apps would need support for such process, of course. I have opened an issue for my specific app (michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client#55) but I guess there would need to be such systems in place for this to work with Telegram or Whatsapp or whatever... Finally, I understand if you close my feature request as out of scope, but please do consider at least the case where the sim card is misplaced, removed, or the phone is in airplane mode. Usability could be improved at that level. At least having a timeout (or a shorter one, if there is one already) would improve the situation here. Steps to reproduce remove your SIM card register a SIP account with SMS support (e.g. at https://voip.ms/) install an app to manage SMS in Android (e.g. https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client) try to send an insecure message in Signal Actual result: the message never gets sent and gets stuck in the &quot;bouncing 3 dots&quot; state forever (or at least, I have a few messages stuck in that state since saturday, so 48h+) Expected result: detect there is no SIM card and fail, or offer some configuration option to send messages through another messaging app Screenshots The above screenshot shows Signal functioning normally for secure messages, but shows the last message stuck in the &quot;three bouncing dots&quot; state for 3 minutes. Earlier in the history, there are two more messages stuck in that state from saturday (not shown in screenshot).

		Bug description Last week I was travelling. Prior to my trip I had asked a question on the Signal site about migrating my session to my old phone (which would not matter too much if it were lost or stolen). The response I got was: You can install Signal on your other phone.  Any new
installation of Signal will generate new keys.
 However, it doesn't seem to be as simple as this. Steps to reproduce This explains my pre-travel actions: Install signal for android on phone1. Use signal for a while. Partake in private and group messages. Remove sim card from phone1 and install in phone2. Install signal on phone2. At this point, I am on the road with phone2. If you message people, they are informed that my keys have changed, which is fine. However, if other people post in a group chat that you were involved in on phone1, then the group is named Unnamed group on phone2 and the message entry box is un-tappable. You see messages come in, but you are unable to send messages. Then I returned home, and replaced the sim card into phone1. Now I cannot message anyone. The messages have a red message next to them saying Failed to send and Tap for details. When you tap, you see ( i ) Some issues need your attention and Failed to send. There is are-send` button, but it doesn't help in this case. Expected Outcome Signal should work on multiple devices per account (and it would be nice if it worked on tablets too). I think the issues I outline are because each user is expected to have exactly one keypair. This would be fine if there were a way to share a keypair between more than one device, or if Signal allowed one account to have multiple key-pairs. Maybe this design decision relates to the fact that a phone number can be active in only one device at a time? I also note that signal still works on phone1 which has no SIM card inserted. Not sure if that is desired behaviour(?). I'm not sure what I should do to get signal working again, please advise. Thanks

		Setting the trusted state have to be done by the user, at the moment every message is checked of in chat without the user can even know, if he can trust this fingerprint.... Else simply checking if the fingerprints are the same isn't enough! The way how it's implemented yet is practically unusable. If the fingerprint is altered by a man in the middle you wouldn't know until you check it again... So doing it like in OTR: Saving each fingerprint and display its trusted state in Chat will be more appropriate in the meaning of feeling secure...

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description A contact which I have previously been communicating with via the secure data channel has suddenly only become able to send via SMS, however messages (and voice calls) from this contact continue to be received via the data channel. It appears that my device has decided that the remote user is no longer using Signal. Unfortunately I was unable to capture a debug log when the changeover occurred. (27 hours ago) Looking back through the conversation it appears that a message failed to deliver, and all further messages fell back to the SMS transport. I have had the remote user restart the secure session, which has no impact. The only debug step I have not taken is to delete the conversation and attempt to restart it. I would prefer not to do this and lose the conversation history if possible. Steps to reproduce Attempt to send user a message Actual result: Message delivered via SMS (If message sent from desktop app a &quot;Message not sent&quot; error appears.) Expected result: Message delivered via data channel. Attempt to reset secure session using menu in conversation. Actual result: &quot;Invite&quot; menu option is available. Expected result: &quot;Reset secure session&quot; menu option is available. Attempt to call user Actual result: Call is made using standard dialer app Expected result: Secure call is initiated. Attempt to reset secure session via desktop app Actual result: &quot;Message not sent&quot; alert appears. Re-sending causes same error. Expected result: Secure session reset successfully.

		I love Signal, and have used it for some time and gotten several friends to start using it. But recently I switched my Motorola Nexus 6 to (AOSP-based) CyanogenMod 13.0.1 (Android 6.0.1 r17), and I don't want to install any Google-compiled proprietary software on it. I see that when I try to install a Signal 3.15.2 .apk from APK Mirror, it does install, and starts. But when I get to the first screen, &quot;Connect with Signal&quot; where it is asking me for verification of my phone number so that it can register me, and I press the &quot;Register&quot; button, it then pops up a white message box saying, &quot;Get Google Play services -- Signal won't run without Google Play services, which are missing from your phone.&quot; And gives me a link (which doesn't work -- no doubt to the Google Play Store) to &quot;GET GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES&quot;. Might it be possible to have a version of Signal without this dependency on having Google Play services installed? Thanks!

		Hi, I'd like to start a discussion regarding adding the ability for Signal to retract messages sent. I propose that a user who sends messages retains the ability to delete a message that will also be deleted on the message recipients devices. Both parties should see that the message was retracted but not the content anymore. 👎 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Sending a large Image (f.i. 13MPixel, ~6MB .jpg) to a Group doesn't resize the Image to a lower dimension and filesize. When you send the same Image to a single Contact in contrary, it -does- resize the image. This leads to a large amount of traffic use on both ends. Group images should ideally be handled the same way as single contact images. In a perfect version, the user should be asked for whether it should resize the image or not. This issue has actually been found and fixed 1 year ago here BUT it is still happening in the latest Version of Signal: #2913 Steps to reproduce create a group, add one or more contacts. send a large image (13 MPixel / ~ 6 MB) to this group. Actual result: The Image is not getting resized and Signal sends a whole 6 MB image to the group. The group receives (and has to download) a full 6 MB Image. Expected result: You actually send a resized image (1280 * xxxx, ~200 KB) to that group. The group receives and downloads just a 200 KB Image.

		Ever since I installed Android M on my Moto G3 I've had problems not filling my internal memory by accident, because Play Music now refuses to put my music on my SD-card. Ordinarily I can handle this quite well, with one exception.. Signal keeps using all the internal space, because everytime I send a video the app creates a duplicate of the file *_inside *_of Signal and I can't help but ask: Why? Why would I ever need a copy of my video inside of Signal? If you send a video you already have it on your phone, so why make another copy? The obvious explanation is that that way you know which video you sent, but really, can't you just add a file name instead? I think this behavior would be fine if I could put Signal on my SD-card, or if Signal could somehow only save transferred files on the SD-card, but in a world where internal space is scarce I think this is a really stupid design decision. Yes, I know about the feature that trims conversations and yes I know I can just delete the video from Signal after sending the file. But come on guys, that shouldn't be necessary!

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports I've always found it unnerving that the keyboard always pops up when opening the contact list (and I'm sure I'm not the only one). Nine out of ten times, I'll immediately close the keyboard. At the same time, I understand that this behavior has its purpose. So in order to make everybody happy, I suggest a small (but quite elegant imho) change that additionally is completely in line with Android's (i. e. Marshmallow's) own behavior regarding e. g. the All Apps button (the button that opens Android's app drawer): Tapping the Compose (i. e. pencil) button opens the contact list (but not the keyboard), Long-pressing the Compose button opens the contact list AND the keyboard. Ok, that's it. My suggestion.

		I have: a useful feedback searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description It's worst than a spam, even with an ablocker you can't get rid of it : it's the invite banner in text mode. This is not a feature! it's reductive, I've seen people losing 1/5 of their screen because they are too lazy to click on that small cross and the banner stay forever. It make sense, it's a nice — maybe cool — way to advertise the product, but it is invasive. Steps to reproduce download the app text a non signal friends endure a smaller screen for your 100+ text messaging. Actual result: invasive banner Expected result: no banner. A option to invite friends after registering for the first time would be nice. Or an option in the menu 👎 1

		@moxie0 Could you please release RedPhone server source code? You could release it under the AGPL license, so everybody, who wants to run a modified of the RedPhone server would have to open source the changes. You can read more here: After reading your replies on the list, I understand, that the main reason for not releasing it is that you don't want to be flooded with support questions. Now, that you have an unofficial support forum, you could just redirect support questions there. Are there any other reasons for not releasing RedPhone server source code? I had already asked this question on the mailing list, but I haven't received any official reply. That's why I'm opening an issue here.

		Please see and re-open or merge in #5186. I have been struggling with the exact same problem for about two months. I do not have MoboClean installed on my phone. This has happened with two contacts so far and nothing I can do on my end will fix the issue. Symptoms are they send to me via encrypted signal over IP. My outbound to them shows sms as my only choice and I have the &quot;Invite&quot; item in my menu. I use signal as my only messenger for sms or signal contacts.

		There were a lot of cases for this already. After looking through conversations, it seems that each of them references others as duplicates and so all of them are considered closed =). I have a person in my contact list, who is mostly offline but this person is Signal user. I am also Signal user ans I also often get offline. When I send message to this person, it stays undelivered for hours. In case when it is urgent but not confidential at all, I want to have an ability to send it as SMS explicitly. I can just use built-in SMS application to send and receive SMS (as I am going to do now), but it is more comfortable and safe to use Signal here too. So the only wish is to let me decide when talking to Signal users, what exactly I want to send: Signal message, or SMS. Finally, until Signal allows to select between its messages and SMS, replacing stock SMS app with Signal just looks confusing because of above reasons.

		I would like to have Signal display read notifications to contacts that I choose. I have read the lengthy discussion in #957 about read receipts but since this is over 2 years old, I would like to reopen the discussion. From my point of view, having a feature that transmits information (like when a message was read) in an app that is about communication (i.e. the transmission of information) is a good thing. Whether to make this feature on/off by default or opt-in/opt-out is obviously debatable. My personal opinion is that I'd probably like it to be opt-out on a per contact basis, but to not change the current behavior for people from how it currently is, it would probably be more sensible to have Signal ask the question once per contact (when you start a new conversation) unless a default setting is set in the settings section. Even if the feature is delivered as off by default and has to be manually enabled, it would be a big improvement over the status-quo. Because (and I cannot stress this enough after reading through the discussion in #957) having a minority restrict the choices of a majority is the opposite of freedom and democracy and it seems to me these are among the most important things that free secure messaging is trying to protect.

As a result, I have some contacts who I forget we've verified keys, and so we do it a second time. This isn't harmful, it's just stupid on my behalf :-) If I'm the kind of person who cares about verifying keys (which is rare I grant!) this could also make it easy for me to see whose keys I haven't verified yet. 👍 5

		After the app expires, there is no message to the user that it expired. Only messages simply fail to be send. The only way to discover that the app expired is to see in the debug console: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.TextSecureExpiredException: TextSecure expired (build 1455264177834, now 1463091540114)
 I think this should be more user friendly. Moreover, it would be great if this could be display also few days at least before the expiration. So that user can react in time. 👍 1

He's from Sweden, and I'm in the UK. I added him to my contact list, and then later a mutual friend added us both to a group chat. In the group chat, he could send messages but wouldn't receive anything. However, to us, it would look as if the messages have been delivered. When I try sending a private message, it defaults to SMS. However, he is able to send me private messages, so clearly his client recognises my number as a signal contact. Later I reinstalled signal and created a group again, this time the entire group defulted to SMS from the start. He also uses signal for iOS, while I use signal for Android.

		Android 6.0.1, Nexus-5, Signal version 3.15.2. I have a few contacts (maybe 5% of all my Signal partners) where I am able to send encrypted messages to, but this lock sign next to the earphone symbol is missing, indicating unsecure/unencrypted/regular calls only. The phone number syntax is the same across all contacts, removing the account and refreshing things does not help (for testing purposes I tried new, different phone number layouts, prefix vs. +-sign etc. etc., with no improvement). The funny thing is that with those 5% the other contacts do see this lock sign with my contact, and they can successfully inititate Redphone calls to me. It is just my side which cannot initiate encrypted calls. So what is wrong with this 5% of my Signal contacts? Any help is welcome, Kind regards, mistersixt.

Implement an option to use an offline mesh message network like e.g. firechat. firechat and the like use the phones Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas to transmit messages, calls and files without connection to cell towers or Wi-Fi. if more people are using it, it can relay messages through other users to the recipient (less server load). it could be nice if signal could send messages like: is local mesh-network available? yes: use no: ↓ is signal message possible? ues: use, no ↓ use sms. Why usercase1: privacy This will give great privacy reassurance. if you are within range to use a local mesh-network you can communicate &quot;offline&quot; with less chance of mass surveillance. Firechat was used for this reason during the umbrella revolution in Hong Kong for democracy and free speach. usercase2: travel/mass gatherings If you are travelling (to a country where you don't have a mobile plan or in a place without coverage (plane or underground train)) you can use local mesh-network messaging to contact people and to find people in the crowd of a festival etc. This would give great convenience, privacy, communication redundancy and save on you money on your mobile plan.

		I'm on MIUI OS (Xiaomi) and it continually flips default sms app back to the stock one without me knowing. I find out when an sms comes in and lands in the stock message app. Would be great to enable a setting in signal that enforces setting signal as default message/sms app by frequently checking and resetting it if it gets changed. This might be a nice default setting also?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Feature description It's quite common to see non-passphrase users wonder why screenshots in Signal don't work. It probably doesn't make sense to have Screen security enabled by default for them. For passphrase users it makes sense. One option would be to remove the feature completely from settings and make it an implicit feature which depends on the passphrase setting. In #1431 (comment) moxie0 wrote: [The Screen security feature i]s not designed to prevent screenshots, it's designed to notify the task manager that it shouldn't cache screenshots of conversations.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports For some reason, all messages delivered through Signal are slow to deliver. I say this based on the checkmark (sent/delivered) indicator, but also based on manually talking to a contact to figure out when things came through. I find that when this happens, asking the other person to send me a Signal message will force all undelivered messages to go through. In this case, calling through Signal doesn't work - it's just stuck at dialing forever (although it's possible, though unlikely, that I just didn't wait long enough). However, once pending messages are &quot;flushed&quot;, calling starts working again. This happens both on Signal Android and a linked Signal Desktop. I've also seen it happen when contacting contacts on both Android and iOS. At least one of the contacts I've seen this with has been on Signal for months, and at least one contact I've seen this with had literally just installed and registered. When this doesn't happen, I find that messages will sometimes take a couple seconds to go through, but before I started running into this issue (which was a week or two ago), messages would generally go through almost instantly. All contacts that I'm sending messages to are in the same geographic area, so in theory we should all be contacting the same server region (in case there servers run in e.g. multiple AWS regions). Device info Device: Nexus 6P Android version: CyanogenMod 13.0-20160604-NIGHTLY-angler, based on Android 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.16.0, installed via the Google Play Store gapps was installed via the OpenGApps nano package. I'm on Play Store 6.5.08.D-all [0] 2792142, Google Play Services 9.0.83 (440-121911109). The problem seems to occur regardless of whether or not I'm on a WiFi network. I called my contact over the cell network - he was on WiFi while I was seeing the issue, and said that both my test messages went through when he disconnected (although I only saw a delivery receipt on one of them - possibly a different bug).

		Feature suggestion: Remote Deletion of my sent messages on other chat partners devices AKA kill switch for messages, that I wrote. Current Situation: Android: can limit to e.g. 50 messages, older messages get deleted automatically. (need to define this for all chat partners individually) Feature Suggestion Variant A) I can set the &quot;Remote limit of my messages&quot; to automatically cut off after 50 messages in MY chat with the other chat partner on THEIR devices. (kill older messages, than 50) Variant B) Remote Delete my sent messages on other chat partners devices (kill my messages) Reason: I want to keep control of my messages, of my lines that I sent, after I sent them.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I'm using Signal on a Sony Xperia M2 and it works perfectly. My sister just installed Signal on her Sony Xperia M4 a few days ago but when we're sending messages to each other, the message doesn't deliver until we unlock our Android phones… Is there something we can do to avoid that? It's very annoying and I have to unlock my phone every 30 minutes or so to be sure that my sister hasn't sent me a message… And she has the exact same problem. Steps to reproduce I send her a message or she sends me a message with the Android Signal app. Actual result: I don't receive the messages that my sister sends me with the Android Signal application when my phone is locked. I have to unlock my phone to receive her messages. And she has the same problem when I send her a message. Expected result: I should receive her messages without having to unlock my phone, like you normally receive messages on a phone. Device info Device: Sony Xperia M2 (for me) and Sony Xperia M4 (for my sister) Android version: 4.4.4 Signal version: 3.16.0 Link to debug log There's no debug log.

		This is a credibility issue. I try to get everyone to use Signal, but twice in a row now when I try to get Android users (i have iOS) to do it, they are fine until Signal requires access to everything. Then I look like a liar, a dummy, or both. For example, why does Signal need access to the calendar? Just because it's open source isn't enough for many people to trust it if their phone tells them it wants to see everything. Is there a way to let users opt out of some features so they can decide what the appropriate level of access is?

		Changing phone number after verifying old phone number can lead to interesting stuff if provider decides to reuse old phone number. NOTE: This might not be an issue with app or might not be an issue at all but something to keep in mind, or maybe it is known (quick google returned nothing similar). Or maybe something can be done with protocol or by making app verify SIM_card/phone_number did not change. No idea. Just putting this here. Steps to reproduce Register and verify current phone number with signal. Change phone number. (get new sim card in my case). 2.1. Forget to register and verify your new phone number with signal (because it still works! I still get messages from my signal contacts...). Get old phone number blocked and reused by provider. (someone else now has your old phone number) (I think this could be easily reproduced without providers reusing your phone number and just putting sim card into some other phone) (TO RESEARCH: what would happen if new owner of my old phone number also registered that phone number with signal? Would I receive his/her messages assuming I did not change my signal phone number?) Actual result: Other people can still send SMS to you by using your old phone number while using signal. Using not_signal to send messages sends them to person who now has your old phone number. Calling them via signal (icon was of not encrypted call) calls new owner of your old phone number (awkward conversation...). Expected result: No idea. Check if user has not changed their phone number to prevent such fun incidents?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I can't send a regular SMS to a contact with whom I normally use Signal. This is sometimes necessary if a contact exhausted their data plan for example. The only workaround I've found is to make the regular SMS app the default app, send the message, then set the default back to Signal. Steps to reproduce Make sure Signal is the default app for SMS Look up the contact in the address book Click in the message icon next to the number Compose a message Actual result: Message is sent through the Signal protocok, and there is no way to change that behaviour. The contact doesn't get it if they don't have an internet connection on their device Expected result: There would be a way to switch temporarily to regular messages for the contact. Not sure of the exact optimal behaviour in terms of UX, but it should be technically possible to send an SMS.

		Bug description I used to have Signal for Android which I loved. However I got an ubuntu phone which doesn't have signal. My friend got a new phone and I recommended that they get signal. They sent me a message (which was an encrypted one as it detected my cell number) which I never received. I presume this is because Signal is trying to deliver an encrypted message to me which I can't receive. Ideally Signal would detect that I no longer use the app and can't receive encrypted messages, and should deliver a normal SMS instead. Steps to reproduce use signal stop using signal someone who still uses signal sends you a message Actual result: you never receive the sent message. Expected result: signal defaults to SMS (or asks sender if they're okay downgrading to SMS) once it realises you're no longer using the app and can't receive encrypted messages.

		I think it should be made more clear that SMS is possible with signal contacts, as it's not immediately obvious that you have to hold down the send button. There are a few annoying edge-cases that come up when a user doesn't have an internet connection. One, is that signal doesn't &quot;remember&quot; that it's sending a message. If you consider another platform like WhatsApp, if there isn't an internet connection, the app keeps trying to send it until it succeeds. With signal, if a user sends a message and forgets about it, it won't be sent even when an internet connection becomes available again. Another solution is to transition to SMS when there isn't a connection. Obviously a seamless transition brings forth security concerns, but a warning message alerting the user that a connection isn't available and then asking if they'd like to send an insecure SMS message instead could work. The app would display the messages differently and ask again after n minutes.

In case a person is enforced to reveal the data, after some time and multiple threats one may decide to use the correct passphrase and the data gets decrypted although it may contain sensible information. It might be useful to be able to set a deletion passphrase which causes creates an empty new database or a sane version with some dummy messages and deletes the actual messages. Steps to reproduce This is not a bug report but a features request. Actual result: Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) The feature does not exist yet. Expected result: Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) Ideal steps: In Settings -&gt; privacy, in case a passphrase is set, provide a field &quot;set deletion passphrase&quot;. It should not be visible if such a passphrase is enabled. Old ones may not be overwritten. If this passphrase is entered to access signal, all data shall be deleted.

Today I've &quot;dirty&quot; flashed the latest Android 7.0 Preview 5 image. I have wiped the cache partition afterwards. Signal is working on Android 7 Preview 5, but when I click the paperclip button to add an attachment, Signal freezes immediately. The blinking cursor in the text input field stops blinking and the app does not respond to any further input. After closing the app by swiping it off the recent apps list, Signal can be opened again.

Click on paperclip button or select respective menu item to add an attachment to the message. Actual result: Signal hangs/freezes immediately. The cursor stops blinking and the app does not respond to any further input. Expected result: The &quot;attachment selection dialogue&quot; is shown, so I can select an attachment to be added to the message.

		I'd prefer not to share my Signal availability to all my contacts, but rather to a contact group I can select. I recognize this is perhaps a niche request, I'd also be helped with pointers how I can program this myself in a private build. I have contacted support@whispersystems.org and they said they couldn't help me, so it looks like that channel isn't the right path for feature requests or tips on how to get into the code base. I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal uses all my system contacts when looking for people to contact/sending the list of number hashes to the signal servers for discovery.

		Telegram has recently been involved in a government-led hack that exposed many of their Iranian customers: https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/03/telegram-apps-sms-activation-used-to-expose-activists-and-journalists/ The problem is that the carrier intercepted the activation SMS and set up new devices for one's account. Signal seems to have the same vulnerability, maybe worse, since there doesn't seem to be a way to add a password to an account (which Telegram has). There should be a way to better protect users in countries where the government and the carrier cannot be trusted.

		Hey there, I hope this issue is correctly placed here. I want to split it in two tiers: My perception of what the Signal client lacks to be even more user-friendly and easily adaptable, and my personal suggestion, how this situation could be improved. I just realized, that this is a extension of #838 with a slightly different approach. Its still a relevant and interesting topic, in my opinion. The Problem There is a huge trade-off between privacy / trustworthiness and usability (ok, this was obvious). I use signal ever since it was TextSecure and started with SMS (maybe 3 years ago?) and watched it evolve over the time. It continuously became more seamless to use but in my perception, some of this implementations are diametrically opposed to the reason, we all use Signal: privacy. And on the other hand, there are some features that are still very annoying, and I'd bet that this is because of the integrity of the encryption. My Suggestion Eliminate the trade-off between security and convenience: Every feature, that makes the usage more smoothly but on the other hand compromises security / integrity / privacy, should be opt-in/opt-out (with reasonable defaults or a wizard to set them). I assume, that this could help signal to differentiate itself from the competition (e.g. WhatsApp, Threema, Telegram), while makeing it smoothly and even more secure and trustworthy at the same time. Some examples Convenience features, that should be defeatable The sync of my contacts (and everything, that is connected to it): The option could be something like &quot;Stop uploading my contactlist to the servers&quot; - with an explanation what that means to usability. Annoying &quot;features&quot;, that kill the user experience when re-registering or reinstalling the app, my friends need to manually add me to our groups. (My guess would be that this is because of the changed encryption-keys, however, it annoys me.) The option could be something like: &quot;Ignore key-changes in all conversations&quot; - with an explanation of what that means to vulnerability. What do you think? Is this even reasonable? Do you have more suggestons of opt-in-features? Best Regards!

These photos include photos uploaded to Google Drive and are not limited to just my device. I would prefer if Signal did not have access to my Google Drive account. I have checked if Signal has access permissions to Google Drive by checking the connected apps page on the Google Drive website itself and discovered that Signal isn't even listed. I have attempted to view permissions in the Signal app itself but I see nothing about disconnecting or connecting Google Drive. Steps to reproduce Open Signal Tap on a contact you wish to message Attempt to send an image See that your &quot;Recent&quot; photos contain Google Drive photos sigh because you don't want to see those photos in Signal at all Actual behavior: Signal has access to Google Drive photos Expected behavior: Signal should not have access to my Google Drive photos Device info Device: Huawei Nexus 6P Android version: N Signal version: 3.16.1

		Hi, out of interest, when comparing MAC digests, current implementation uses Arrays.equals(ourMacBytes, theirMacBytes) (in lieu of, lets say, the crypto friendly java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual). Not sure how relevant timing attack is in the context of the client performing such comparison in non-constant time fashion, but as a matter of principle, in a crypto conscious app, you'd think that ought to be there regardless, specially, that MAC digests are already truncated relative to their original ful length values.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal force closes with a NPE when trying to sync contacts. Steps to reproduce There are two ways to reproduce the issue: Go to Settings / Accounts / Signal Choose &quot;Sync now&quot; from the menu Shortly after a &quot;Signal has been closed&quot; from Android appears Open Signal, to to Settings and retrieve log. or Open Signal, start a new conversation When selecting a contact to start conversation to, choose &quot;Sync now&quot; from the menu Shortly after a &quot;Signal has been closed&quot; from Android appears Actual result: Looking at the logs shows a NPE when processing the contacts. Unfortunately the crash doesn't indicate which contact is causing the issue. I've also seen it after completely emptying the address book, so it looks like it's related to Signals contact mapping. As a side note, after I removed and restored my address book I have several contacts in Signal that only show numbers, but not names. When checking the contact the Signal entry is missing. I can manually restore that to make the name show up again. My guess is that those names don't have the Signal entry (restored) because the sync crashed. --------- beginning of crash

		Bug description When I want to invite people to Google's new video service Duo I get the wrong number in Signal but not in other SMS applications I tested. Steps to reproduce Open Google Duo Click on &quot;video call&quot; Click on &quot;invite&quot; of someone Use Signal for sending the SMS Actual result: The country code is wrong, so the number +49 161 7654321 looks like +49249201617654321. The first 492 is my local country code, it stays the same no matter what the actual one is, the second 492 depends on the number, if it Germany it is 492, if it the US it is 12. After that the number follows in a local form, so for German numbers it begins with an 0. Expected result: The SMS should be sent to the actual number.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I have a large group chat of Signal users (12), and when a message is sent to some, but not all of the members, (likely due to intermittent internet connectivity) that message may be spammed when the user attempts to resend the message by clicking on it for details, then manually clicking &quot;Resend&quot; to each member, to all members, the number of times the &quot;Resend&quot; button was clicked, plus one if they received the message the first time. Steps to reproduce Take a group message that failed to send to some users, but not all users. Click &quot;Resend&quot; on all of the users it failed to send to the first time. For every time the &quot;Resend&quot; button is pressed, all users will receive the message again, if this time it is successful. Actual result: So I walked around a large building that I was in, while on data, sending messages until one of them failed to send to some users, but not all. I then walked outside of the building, to where I had a good data connection, and pressed the &quot;Resend&quot; button on all of the users. Instead of re-sending to just the ones that were clicked, all users received the message, and those that had received it the first time, received it once more. Expected result: If a message fails to send to some users, when I press the &quot;Resend&quot; button to a specific user, it should resend the message to ONLY that user, or to all users that failed originally, but preventing the user from pressing the &quot;Resend&quot; button again, unless the resend fails once more.. Notes All users that have caused the spam have been Android users. I believe this might be caused by rapidly pressing all of the &quot;Resend&quot; buttons before Signal Resends the message.

There's no problem with %ds and %dm which can be translated to %dsek and %dmin, but there's no way for other time periods to get shorten and look proper in Slovenian language. This issue can be solved if I just don't shorten %dh, %dd and %dw but that means that these strings should also have their plurals in Transifex.

		Hi, build 3.18.0 has introduced the ability to select (and delete) notification messages. For group update messages there is a bug. If you select one the save button becomes visible. (Further on it can be clicked. The same procedure like for media messages will be initiated. However I don't know if really something is saved.) Solution: Hide save button for all kinds of notification messages. Please note that only the notification messages of self initiated group updates are affected by this bug. Notification messages of group updates from other group members are not affected. Found in build 3.18.1. 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports This is a pretty straightforward feature request. Right now, saving media places it in the root of the media type (eg the &quot;Pictures&quot; directory) and backups get exported to the root of the device. I'd like to be able to specify an alternate directory, to keep my device less-cluttered. In the case of media in particular, it would be great if it would be possible to do in settings, so that the user won't have to choose a location in a dialogue every time they save something (or if there must be a dialogue, have it remember the last chosen location so the user doesn't have to navigate to the right directory every time)

		Deterministic builds (Gitian) is an excellent, decentralized, secure means of distributing binaries: Gitian is a secure source-control oriented software distribution method. This means you can download trusted binaries that are verified by multiple builders. Gitian uses a deterministic build process to allow multiple builders to create identical binaries. This allows multiple parties to sign the resulting binaries, guaranteeing that the binaries and tool chain were not tampered with and that the same source was used. It removes the build and distribution process as a single point of failure. Gitian is used in the Bitcoin project. Yes, there have been many issues (e.g., #122, #127, #281, #282, #458, #525, #722, #2858, #3435, #3954, #4429, #4430) regarding distributing Signal in other ways than via Google Play or Apple Store, but I do not think my feature request is a duplicate of those.

		While contact discovery is useful for the usecase of an average user just wanting secure communication with their friends, it is a huge security risk for activists. Although Signal is not primarily aimed at activists, there are no suitable alternatives on mobile. Are there plans to improve Signal in this area? Numbers are available to anyone in the group chat, so adding someone to a group requires you have to trust them not to leak phone numbers. There are no display names, so having everyone introduce themselves to each other is tedious and requires adding each other to contact lists, which is potentially a security risk as well. Global display names would not solve the problem, as you'd need to use a separate one in your activism group chats and with your friends.

		Bug description I am trying to link Signal desktop to my android phone. I have done this before, but the new version of signal desktop is asking me to do it again. When I try to scan the QR code, the camera on my phone does not focus and the code does not scan. I am able to use a 3rd party scanner, which scans fine, giving me a link. I tried that link in the browser, but Signal said that for my own protection I should scan from inside Signal. I attempted again after having unlinked my previously linked device, with the same result. So, I'm stuck. Device info Andorid 4.0.4 and Signal 3.18.3 on HTC Thunderbolt I am only using the Signal client, it is not set as the default SMS app. Ubuntu 16.04 Gnome and Signal 0.22.2 on Thinkpad T530

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal doesn't support the full range of emoji's now offered in Android N such as skin color. I know Signal uses the Apple emoji's but it doesn't offer the latest emoji's incorporated into iOS either. List of Emoji's on Android N: http://emojipedia.org/google/android-7.0/ List of Emoji's on iOS: http://emojipedia.org/apple/ Is it possible to add support for the new emoji's supported by Apple and Google? I know this is a pretty low priority issue but from a &quot;usability&quot; standpoint, it stands out as an &quot;issue&quot; for non technical people who have been converted by their techy friends. Would be nice to stay current on the flashy parts of the Android and iOS ecosystems so it is easier to be an evangelist and get people to convert to Signal. Steps to reproduce Use the new skin tone emoji's using a keyboard such as google keyboard or Swiftkey Actual result: Unicode support for skin tone are not supported in Signal. Expected result: Accurate depiction of the most recent emoji's used by Apple and Google. Screenshots Device info Device: Nexus 6P Android version: 7.0 Signal version: 3.19.0 👍 1

		This is a duplicate of #672, which was opened almost three years ago and forgotten about. Image compression in signal is ridiculous. Any text is completely illegible and anything else isn't worth saving. I'm not sure why it was set so high in the first place, but in 2016 it's just an annoying &quot;feature&quot;. 👍 4

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When trying to change one contact's color, Signal crashed. Since then, whenever I try to start Signal, it instantly crashes. When enabling airplane mode, Signal starts successfully (that's how I was able to produce a log - thanks to @FeuRenard for the tip). When I disable airplane mode while Signal is running, it crashes again. This could be related to the recently introduced contact color sync (with Signal Desktop). Steps to reproduce (correctly pointed out by @FeuRenard ) Pick a contact that is not in your address book (in my case a non-Signal i. e. SMS contact: a Facebook 2FA SMS with no phone number visible - just &quot;Facebook&quot; as the sender) Go to the contact preferences Change the contact color Device info Device: Google Nexus 5 Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.19.0 Debug log https://gist.github.com/RiseT/035f7ee2e622852a16d0c18ace62b0bf#file-signal-android-issue-5704-txt

		Especially when the internet connection is bad, Redphone calls sometimes break. It would be great to hear a sound as soon as a call ends, because I happened to continue talking quite often without noticing that the call is already over. The feature is available in normal phone calls too, so I think Signal should definitely have it.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Not sure if this problem is on Signal Android's end or on Signal Desktop's. One of my SMS (non-Signal) contacts just got synched with Signal Desktop after changing its color on Signal Android, i. e. the contact is (was) listed on Signal Desktop's contact list - not the conversation. After exiting Signal Desktop and starting it again, that contact magically disappeared again. Edit: I've been able to reproduce this a second time and updated this issue with new debug logs for Signal Android and Signal Desktop. All logs are now taken directly after the issue happened.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Android 7.0 (Nougat) adds bundled notifications which allows the app to group notifications in a way that lets the user expand the group to work with each notification individually (https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0.html#notification_enhancements). Currently, when Signal has notifications from two or more conversations, the notifications are grouped together into one notification that cannot be expanded, preventing the user from preforming quick actions on the notifications without entering the app. Implementing the new notification feature will allow Signal to continue to group notifications with the added benefit of preforming quick actions on each notification individually.

		In order to counter shoulder surfing an option could be added to show a contact in: name + (wherever possible) phone number (as is currently done and default option name only (no phone numbers are shown anywhere unless contact is not in address book phone numbers only (no names are shown anywhere, only initial letter in contact avatar) (alternatively as name, the same initial could be used as is used for the contact's avatar) Places where this applies is the overview of contacts, a dialogue, notification drawer et cetera. Implementing would greatly counter shoulder surfing in terms of with whom one is commuicating.

		I want to see Signal to have a setting where it can automatically create a backup on the phone of it's messages (SMS/MMS/etc) and the key set, in a bundle that I can backup to my servers (for example, to ownCloud). There's already a way to export to clear text, but this doesn't backup the keys. And, this is manual. I need this, otherwise wiping my device, or switching to a new one, is going to be painful. Or, to put it another way, if my phone is lost, so is all my messaging. Who isn't an advocate for backups? Please?

		We need a per-contact setting to disable secure messaging, and just use regular SMS. Why? I have come across contacts who are incorrectly considered to be Signal users. That is to say: Signal wants to send them encrypted messages over data, but these people do not have Signal installed, and claim to have never used Signal or TextSecure previously. I assume the issue comes about from mobile number re-use.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When Signal is called from the &quot;Recent Apps List&quot;, or &quot;Overview&quot; the user is properly returned to the window they were last using. However, When Signal is selected from App Drawer, or Home, the conversation list is always displayed as if first being run. This is nonstandard from other messenger apps and does not give the user the functionality they expect. Steps to reproduce Select Signal from either Home or App Drawer Select a conversation Press the Home Key Select Signal from home or App Drawer Actual result: When selecting signal from either the app drawer or home screen you are always presented with the same conversation list. Expected result: A New user expects selecting signal from the app drawer or home screen to return to the last open window (be it the last conversation, setting screen, etc) just as if they selected it from the recent apps list.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When you change the disappearing message timer, a notification appears, but whether that notification hangs around depends on whether you're in a group vs. contact thread. Steps to reproduce Given I'm in a group thread When I enable the (unreleased) disappearing messages feature And set the timer to 5 seconds Then I see the &quot;You set disappearing message time to 5 seconds.&quot; In five seconds that info message is deleted. Given I'm in a contact thread When I enable the (unreleased) disappearing messages feature And set the timer to 5 seconds Then I see the &quot;You set disappearing message time to 5 seconds.&quot; The info message never gets deleted. Actual result: Contact thread &quot;You set disappearing message time&quot; info messages are never deleted. Expected result: Primarily I expect the Contact thread info message to be deleted. Though if you could make a case for why the notification should remain, then at least it should be consistent across group and contact threads.

		Link Android and Desktop with disappearing messages support Go to conversation list on Android Open a conversation on Desktop Receive a 10s disappearing message on Desktop Note that it is also received and marked read in the Android conversation list Wait 10 seconds Actual result: Message expires from Desktop, but is still readable Android Expected result: Message expires on both clients at about the same time Note that it's not enough to start the timer when marking the message read. You have to back-date it by looking at the send time of the read receipt itself in case your client has been offline for a while.

		Hello. It would be great for Signal to support multiple android devices so people will be able to use it on smartphone and tablet simultaneously like in case of WhatsApp or Viber. For many people this is a stopper to start using Signal. Thanks in advance! 👍 2

		Bug description Reduced quality of shared images. Steps to reproduce share image via one of the following: a gallery app, within Signal, or taking a picture with signal. save shared image to phone and view details - note resolution check details of original image - compare resolution to that of the sent image. notice that resolution is drastically impaired vs the original Actual result: Resolution of sent image is much lower than that of the original image. Expected result: Resolution of sent image should be the same as that of the original image. Other Thoughts: Sending a full size 1080p video worked flawlessly in my test. the resolution and perceived quality are the same between original and sent video.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description In my Android address book the Signal contacts (with &quot;Signal Call&quot; and &quot;Signal message&quot;) were seperated from the real contact (with the phone number, mail address and other stuff) (this isn't the bug I want to report here, it could be caused by moving my contacts from google to owncloud). I thought I can just remove the &quot;duplicates&quot; (signal contacts), refresh contact list and this will be fixed, but now the contacts are broken (see Actual result). Steps to reproduce open address book remove the signal-part from the contact open signal refresh contact list Actual result: The contacts appear as SMS-only users, but when I click on them, a secure Signal chat opens Expected result: They should appear as Signal users again Screenshots For privacy reasons, I don't want post screenshots or debug logs Device info Device: Oneplus X Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.19.1 (Google Play Version) App state Signal messages and calls registered, SMS enabled, passphrase disabled, dark theme, default notification settings, using chrome app

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description In some translations (e. g. German...), the vertical window size for the 'Disappearing messages' picker is changing when changing the selection from 'Off' to some timeframe. This is because the description string changes from the rather short ExpirationDialog_your_messages_will_not_expire to the rather lengthy ExpirationDialog_your_messages_will_disappear_s_after_they_have_been_seen. Please add space for one (or even two to be really sure) more line of text in the description so the window size stays constant for both strings. I guess this should suffice for any language. PS: Additionally, I think it would look better if you added a bit of vertical space below the title ('Disappearing messages') as well. Steps to reproduce (doesn't apply to e. g. English) Open conversation Select 'Disappearing messages' Scroll from 'Off' to some other timeframe Actual result: Window size changes when switching timeframe Expected result: Window size stays constant Device info Device: LG Nexus 5X Android version: 7.0.0 Signal version: 3.20.0

		The Android Play Services and play-services-maps were upgraded from 8.1.0 to 9.4.0, but the checksums in build.gradle (line 107 and 108) were not changed, so the build fails. Removing the lines solved the issue, but the checksums have to be updated. The same holds for com.android.support:appcompat, com.android.support:recyclerview, com.android.support:cardview, com.android.support:design, com.google.android.gms:play-services-base, com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement and com.android.support:support-v4. I wonder how OWS builds the project. Are there things not checked in or do they disable the checksums completely? After that, the build fails with Signal-Android\build\intermediates\res\merged\debug\values-v23\values-v23.xml Error:(4) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Inverse'. Error:(34) Error retrieving parent for item: No resource found that matches the given name 'android:Widget.Material.Button.Colored'. I'm still working on that one.

Du hat die Zeit zum Verschwinden der Nachricht auf 1 Woche festgelegt The string above contains three errors. Correct is: Du hast die Zeit zum Verschwinden der Nachrichten auf 1 Woche festgelegt**.** (Also note the dot at the end.) Since I don't know if the English language string is correct and if the German string can be fixed by translation I post this one as issue. Found with build 3.20.3 (and older).

		I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Disappearing messages can be viewed repeatedly and without starting a timer when they are in the notification drawer. Steps to reproduce Have message notifications enabled Receive a disappearing message Open android notification drawer to read message Actual result: The message can be viewed without a time limit via the notification drawer. Closing and reopening the notification drawer does not start the deletion timer either, hence messages can be viewed repeatedly. Expected result: I would expect the message to be hidden until it is either opened in app (to start the deletion timer) or would expect to be able to start a timer by previewing the message in the notification drawer after actively clicking to read message - I would imagine that this could happen in a similar fashion as is possible already when replying to a message directly from the notification drawer, without fully entering the app. Device info Device: Oneplus 2 Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.20.4 Link to debug log If you want I can supply one, but don't think this is necessary here.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I turned on &quot;repeat alerts&quot; (one time) after the new update. No conversation appeared to contain unread messages. Since, I repeatedly get the notification that a particular thread has three new locked messages, although Signal is unlocked. I tried to open the conversation, to mark the messages as read in the notification itself and to mark all messages as read from the dots-menu. However, the notification pops up again after some time. The conversation in question is pretty long (&gt;&gt;&gt; 500 messages) and old but otherwise seem unsuspicious. I also attempted to disable notification temporarily for that conversation and in general - did not help. Steps to reproduce Unfortunately, I do not know how to trigger the bug for a conversation.

		It would be nice to have the possibility to always disallow disappearing messages if you never want a contact to put a timer on your conversations. The person trying to set a timer could even get a message saying that the other contact refuses to have disappearing messages / deactivated disappearing messages. 👍 1 👎 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Feature description It is currently not possible to still receive notification messages for a group when you have enabled the Mute notifications option in a group chat. In other words, both the notification sound and the notification messages are muted. WhatsApp gives you the option to still receive notifications for a group chat after you muted it, thus effectively only muting the notification sound. I received a complaint from a user who just converted from WhatsApp to Signal who would like this feature to also be present in Signal. Steps to reproduce open a group chat click on the options menu &gt; Mute notifications Wanted result: - ideally there would be a check box allowing you to choose if you still want to receive notification messages Screenshots This shows how WhatsApp implemented this feature Device info Device: Nexus 5 Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.20.4 😕 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description The app crashes immediately upon viewing a message thread that contains a media message (i.e. image). The thread can never be viewed, not even in airplane mode. It is also not possible to delete the thread: moving to archive works, but trying to delete from archive results in the same crash. Because I expected it to be a corrupt database issue I have completely removed the signal app data and re-registered my phone. The app worked again but was more unstable than I previously experienced. As soon as I received a media message the thread makes the app crash again like before. Two things I did before I ran into those problems: Updated Fairphone OS from FP2 release 1.6.1 to 1.8.1 Updated Android Web View from Play Store I have no idea if any of those events are really related to the crashes, though. Just to try I have also uninstalled the Web View updates but that did not lead to an improvement. Note: The updates to the Fairphone OS should only have contained the latest google security fixes up to October and no other feature changes. Steps to reproduce receive media message from contact try to open message from notifications or from contact list in app Actual result: App force closes immediately Expected result: Message thread should be displayed Screenshots none Device info Device: Fairphone2 Android version: 5.1 (r4275.1_FP2_gms66_1.8.1) Signal version: 3.20.4 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/845adc40ff80f0d3fdd506641bc41f2c

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description This is a feature request/wish: A recent update added Giphy support. While I am not too convinced by the usefulness of this, I understand that for many users it is very important. However, trying to find a useful GIF or sticker in Signal is a fools errand of scrolling through a myriad of rather low-quality GIFs/stickers (does it just display the most recently uploaded ones?). A search field would in my opinion go a long way to make this more useful. Steps to reproduce Try to send a friend a &quot;Thanks Obama&quot; GIF (example specimen: https://giphy.com/gifs/13ypZYdIckeO5O). Select Attachment-&gt;Giphy. Scroll through endless list of other GIFs that don't express the sentiment I try to convey. Actual result: I give up before ever sending the message.

		One of the requests that came out of the work to improve photo quality (#672) was the ability to simply send photos exactly as they are, without reprocessing them. In the other thread, there are many good reasons why there isn't an option to handle photos that way, dealing with the previews, display, memory limitations, etc. It occurs to me that the way to allow this option to those that need it - and also provide more utility overall - is to provide an option to send arbitrary file types - including photos - without processing them. There are currently choices for Images, Audio, Video when sending a message. Just give us an option for &quot;Files&quot;. Add an option to the attachment area for &quot;File&quot;. If we pick a picture via the file option, instead of the image option, we just send the image exactly as is with no processing / preview / etc. The bonus is it now works for any file type.... and I can finally send full resolution images without having to revert to e-mail or something like that. Giving us the ability to push them through as files, however, bypasses a all of the issues related to device memory, preview, etc. Following the existing UI design / pattern gives the user customizability over what is downloaded (and when - only wifi, etc). It also now lets us send any other document securely, which would be a great bonus. Not sure what the upper limit needs to be on the file size... but even if it was as low as 10 MBs, we could send full resolution photos.

		I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal crashes regurarly on Android 7.1 (LG Nexus 5X). It turns silent every few minutes or even every few seconds. Either the person I talk to gets muted or I get muted. After that happens a few times, the app crashes totally (doesn't react when I press &quot;call&quot; button) and it's impossible to make or receive calls at all. When it crashes like that it's only possible to write messages, calls don't work at all. Only phone restart helps, which is really irritating and time consuming. And then it starts again right away. Steps to reproduce -Just receive or make a call using Signal -After a couple of seconds/or about minute or two in the conversation (I think it's more or less random, but happens every single time I use Signal) the person I talk to gets muted. I can't hear them at all. Them after some time either the voice comes back (and then gets muted again several times in a row in a matter of next minutes) or the coversation ends spontaneously and I'm taken back to contacts menu -When the call drops, I'm unable to call anyone again or receive calls Actual result: Call gets muted a couple of times and then drops. The app doesn't allow me to make calls and the other side is unable to call me as well. Expected result: call doesn't drop or go mute until I press End Call button (big red). The app doesn't crash every single time and allows me to make and receive calls without restarting the phone Screenshots Device info Device: LG Nexus 5X Android version: 7.1 Signal version: 3.21.3 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/4992ca7edb89f637e9b2d08b9c9f8340

		It is impossible to set it up in New Caledonia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_New_Caledonia). The app shows an error &quot;Connectivity issue&quot;. I had a look to the logcat, and the app sends a request to the server with this url: https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/v1/accounts/sms/code/+687xxxxxx If I access it in a browser I get this reply from your server: {&quot;code&quot;:400,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;HTTP 400 Bad Request&quot;} Then I tried a phone number from France and accessed the url https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/v1/accounts/sms/code/+33xxxxxxxxx And it works (well I get an empty response instead of a &quot;400 Bad Request&quot;). There definitely is a server issue not accepting New-Caledonia 6 digits numbers.

		Signal includes the Apple Color Emoji library to render emoji's on Android. The problem is that Apple developed it strictly for their own use and they are not licensing it to anybody. This puts the Android version of Signal in a legal grey area. This could be fixed by switching to an alternative emoji library. For something similar to Apple's library, Twitter's Twemoji could be considered.

		Hi. I'm using Signal since some time and there is one thing which still confuses me. There is no visible option to access archived messages. Swiping message right archives a message. If you made a mistake you can undo the action. But how to access archived messages in general? I can not see any option to do this.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I have had this problem several times now. Sometimes when i respond to a signal message, it send's an sms (I'm not Holding the send button) wich don't get delivered because i don't have a simcard in my phone. It is sitting in airplane mode just with wifi turned on and connected to the interent via hotspot. When i delete this particular sms message and try to send another message to an registered Signal user it just shows the bouncing 3 dots. It never leaves the phone. It never tells that the message can't be delivered or something similar. I have to wait till an update is avalable or reinstall signal. EDIT: And i just noticed that the camera ain't working in the app too at the moment. I will terminate the signal process and capture another log. When i get my other Phone back i will try to reproduce this behaviour. The last time it happened, was when i got a msg from a user who just registered and typed my phone number in and hit send after the app showing him that i am a signal user. I got the msg, but couldn't reply to it with a data msg. Only SMS Steps to reproduce -I could not reproduce this one Actual result: Signal users dissapear. Can't send any Messages. Just make calls Expected result: Don't stuck in any thread where it tries to deliver the sms and send normal signal data Messages.

		Signal messages have delivery reports by default, but SMS conversations do not. That results in kind of a confusing UX where some conversations have double checkmarks to confirm delivery, and some do not. Turning on the &quot;SMS delivery reports&quot; option by default would improve this. 👍 2

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal lets you send voice notes, even if it is plaintext sms. Therefore GSM message. And therefore extremely expensive. Steps to reproduce Have Signal installed as your default messenger. Use it to send regular SMS. Open conctact who is not a Signal user. Press push to talk. Send voice note. Actual result: Voice note is send. Since it is transmitted via GSM it is converted to an MMS message. And MMS messages are extremely expensive. I pay 0.49€ for a single one. I know that in other countrys you pay a lot less, if at all. So I wanted to you to be aware of it. Expected result: I don't know really know to be honest. Just hide it in sms mode works for me. But at the same time is probably quite annoying for someone who does not have to pay for mms messages and would like to use that feature even in sms mode. Differentiate userbase for location and mms fees and hide/show push-to-talk button accordingly is probably a PITA. Sorry no easy solution here. But I can see people using the voice-notes. And paying a hefty bill afterwards. Which, although it is the users fault, could lead to bad Signal reputation.

		Hi. I am Pradip Sikdar, a visually challenged android intermediate user. I have started using Signal Private Messanger for Android recently and most of the part, I am quite happy with it. As you know, we use screen reader technology to use our android or IOS devices. So, if there is a menu or button which is not properly tagged or labled, the screen reader doesn't recognize it. For example, let's say there is a play button. Visually there is a sign or graphics which represents that, it is a play button. But if the button is not properly tagged or labled as &quot;Play&quot; button, our screen reader only says &quot;Button Unlabled&quot;. So, we cannot recognize what the button is. So, I am here by requesting to the developer of this nice application, to lable all the buttons of this application. For example, when I am clicking on the &quot;toggle attachment&quot; button, I am getting some additional buttons which are not labled. So, I cannot recognize them. Thanks in advance from all the blind community. Pradip 👍 4

		Dear Devs, First kindly accept my kind gratitude for including the voice note feature in Signal Private Messanger for Android. Here, I am reporting a minor issue which can easily be fixed. The Record button or mic button is improperly labled. In the left of the bottom part of the window, there is the 'emoji' button. then, there is the edit box followed by the 'toggle attachment' button. After that, there is the record button I think. but our screen reader (Talkback) announces it as &quot;toggle attachment&quot; button. That's why, we visually challenged persons are getting two 'toggle attachment' buttons, which is a bit confusing. Kind regards, Pradip 👍 2

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I recently upgraded my Galaxy S7 Edge to Android 7.0 as part of a beta program before Android 7.0 is rolled out publicly on the Samsung S7 series phones. After upgrading and doing a full factory reset, I reinstalled Signal. I am now experiencing a bug where after I make a call with Signal, future calls (either incoming or outgoing) fail. If I try to make an outgoing call, no call is placed, and I see a broken interface with no buttons (screenshot: http://imgur.com/a/IL2im), and I have to use my phone's back button to exit. Full functionality can only be restored by either rebooting my phone, or force stopping the Signal app. Steps to reproduce Place or Receive 1st Signal call (so far, everything seems to work; I or recipient answers the call, we are able to converse) Call is terminated either by myself or the other party Try to place another Signal call Broken incomplete interface is displayed and I have to back out of the screen. No call is made or received. Actual result: Broken interface is displayed and no call is connected Expected result: Call should connect as expected and interface should display that allows one control the call.

Basically nothing else works: the contact list is empty; I can receive secure messages (blue lock, &quot;Via: Data (Signal)&quot;) yet Signal prompts me to invite the sender: &quot;Take your conversation with Xxxxxx Yyyyy to the next level.&quot;; I cannot reply: I only see a big gray button &quot;ENABLE SIGNAL FOR SMS&quot;; SMS and MMS are off and I'd like to leave it that way, but if I enable it then I'm able to see the contacts (awkwardly duplicated, e.g., xxxxxxxxxx and xxx xxx xxxx); this situation lasts for months (since the first time I tried signal), I even performed an hard reset recently; the phone is not rooted. Note: due to an operator switch my current SIM cannot always provide the correct phone number (like in this case), so I need to manually fix that. It happens for other services as well, e.g., WhatsApp, without any problems. Anyway, as I said the registration procedure works.

		(I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this issue, so sorry about that) Often times it happens that I want to send a message to myself, but then I basically have to send it to a contact (because I can't send it to myself). It would be nice to send messages to yourself, similar to what Slack has. Some possible reasons would be: not wanting to use a notepad, wanting to send a message from mobile to pc/pc to mobile, etc. 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I was testing &quot;Support for stickers and scribbles&quot; (1b44bdc) on a phone that has (only) 768MB of RAM. The picture to be edited was a 3000 * 4000 pixel (w * h) ~1.9MB jpg. Tapping confirm after minimal editing resulted in a OOM error. I got back to the conversation screen and conversation list by tapping the Android back button. Entering the conversation again from the conversation list then let me sent unsecured SMS only, which is a bad experience. Fortunately &quot;force stop&quot; Signal solves the issue. I wonder if the process would succeed if pictures were scaled before editing? Sending the same picture without prior editing works as expected.

		As I see from 541718f Signal does implement some ways to circumvent censorship. This issue is mostly a report, I'm not sure if anything can actually be done. I've been in Cuba recently with Signal, registered with an European phone number (there are wifi hotspots in public locations); The Signal servers are not reachable from Cuba, I could not send/receive messages; It did work properly using Tor (Orbot). I see from the commit I referenced that Signal identifies censoring countries with their international phone prefix, so I'm not sure if it would have helped in my case. I did not try to register with a Cuban phone number. 👍 1

		Hello, There was a case in Germany some months ago, where a suspects end-to-end messenger traffic has been decrypted by the German police. In this case it was the application telegram. But I started thinking about this issue, and maybe the same hack could be used with signal too. You might know that signal has a desktop application. The German police used a desktop Application like this to get access to the messages of the suspect. They just requested access to a desktop application, man-in-the-middle'd the incoming Activation-SMS, and had full access to the messages. [1] Is this possible with Signal, too? It would be nice to have an option to disable multiple clients [1] https://motherboard.vice.com/de/read/exklusiv-wie-das-bka-telegram-accounts-von-terrorverdaechtigen-knackt (GERMAN, sorry no english version available)

		Because domain fronting will not work when, for example, you go to Egypt as a tourist with a number from another country, it would be nice to be able to switch it on with an option. When automatic detection of blocking is implemented this option could then be removed again. Another question: why not enable domain fronting for everyone? In some countries Signal may not be blocked but contacting the Signal servers may give you a big &quot;red flag&quot; from intelligence agancies. Is there some technical or other reason why activating it for everyone would not be a good idea?

		Bug description when a user leaves a group, the disappearing messages setting is turned off for the remaining members of the group. Steps to reproduce in a group, turn on disappearing messages. my group had ~8 members. verify that the disappearing setting is on (hourglass on messages) a member who was not the group creator left. (checking with the user to verify platform and version) my android build showed &quot;[creator] set disappearing message time to Off&quot; immediately after &quot;[user] has left the group&quot;. the group creator states they did not turn off disappearing messages. following messages were not marked as disappearing. previous messages disappeared correctly. creator was able to re-enable disappearing after noticing the problem and new messages are disappearing, but the non-disappearing ones are still there. Actual result: disappearing setting disabled when a user left. Expected result: disappearing setting should remain enabled unless turned off explicitly.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When sending a Signal message (not SMS) from a heavily overloaded (WIFI) network the client attempts to send the message multiple times (expected) and eventually displays a red &quot;!&quot; (&quot;Not delivered. Tap for details&quot;). Apparently the message went through nonetheless and not just once but multiple times and is displayed at all recipients multiple times (group chat). We observed this problem within multiple group chats and was triggered by distinct senders. (I personally observed it in two distinct group chats, friends also confirmed this in other group chats.) Note: the sender did not press any of the &quot;RESEND&quot; buttons. Steps to reproduce reproducing the exact network failure rates/environment is not really possible, but here are the simple steps sender: try to send a message while the 3 dots show that the client attempts to still send recipient: displays the same message (by the same sender) multiple times Actual result: Message is displayed multiple time (between 6 and 15 times in our cases) Expected result: The recipient detects that this is the identical message (via a message id, replay protection?)

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Feature Request Could it be possible to remove the contact pic preceding every message (chat bubble) in a conversation in order to reduce the clutter and also make things consistent with the iOS and Desktop versions? Detailed Description While the presence of contact pics before messages is helpful in group conversations (but still overwhelming when multiple messages are sent by the same person in succession as mentioned in #964), they are extremely redundant and make the screen more busy in one-to-one conversations. The colour of the chat bubbles is already an excellent method of distinguishing between messages. While doing something along the lines of other messaging apps (QKSMS, Hangouts, Facebook Messenger or Google Messenger) is what #964 sought by requesting that successive messages from the same contact be bundled, with the contact pic appearing only once for one message bundle, I am suggesting going the WhatsApp route and doing away with contact pics entirely, at least in individual conversation where they add very little, especially in excess. Doing so would have the added benefit of making the Android app consistent with the iOS and Desktop apps where the contact pic doesn't appear within conversations. The desktop app instead displays the contact pic in the action bar which could be one alternate location for displaying the contact pic. Also, hopefully there should be no database issues in implementing this change like was mentioned in that other issue and that might expedite its implementation as it would be a purely UI move? Screenshots Here are the iOS and desktop versions respectively: Here is how WhatsApp handles things presently: The contact pic is relegated to the action bar and messages bubbles only carry the name of the contact. Of course, even the name isn't present in case of individual conversations but I couldn't get a screenshot of that on the Play Store. 👍 3

		Per my 'mis-bugreport' #6014 please add some form of contact management to Signal itself. It seems unlikely that any reasonable user would figure out the method mentioned in #6014 for removing contacts or even just resyncing them with the Android address book. Even if they were motivated enough to find this method, the process even warns the user that their data will be lost when this is not the case.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Duplication This issue overlaps with old issues #1399 and #1467, which were raised in a different context and remain unresolved. Bug description During initial registration, if the SMS verification code arrives but remains undetected by the Signal app, voice verification is mandatory, even though the user could have manually entered the code. Steps to reproduce Have some other app installed that handles SMS (in my case: Google Hangouts). Install Signal app and register. The SMS verification code will arrive but will remain undetected by Signal. Signal will time out and require voice verification, even though the user could have manually entered the SMS code, had the app permitted this. Actual result: As above. Expected result: Opportunity to manually enter the SMS code.

		The &quot;domain fronting&quot; technique to circumvent censorship can be enabled for all users regardless of what mobile number they had used to register or will use to register. Consider the case in which a user with a Canadian number already registered in Canada goes to UAE where Signal is blocked! He must use a VPN solution to access Signal servers. Signal can try main servers if it needs to establish a connection, if failed then try again using domain fronting and this can be enabled for all users by default OR can be added as an option in the welcome screen (first time registration) and in the advanced setting page.

 Original issue was about something else that was already fixed in the beta release at the time of reporting. The original issue was turned into this issue from the second comment. Original issue below for posterity: I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description App crashes. Steps to reproduce Unable to reproduce. This happened twice within a short timespan as I was using the app. Strangely, the action I was performing at the time (1st crash: sending a photo captured within Signal to a group conversation, 2nd crash: responding to a text message to a single contact) was successful both times, even though the app reported that it crashed. Actual result: App crashes and has to be relaunched. Expected result: App should not crash, messages should be sent.

		feature request: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/image-keyboard.html Users often want to communicate with emojis, stickers, and other kinds of rich content. In previous versions of Android, soft keyboards (also known as input method editors or IMEs) could send only unicode emoji to apps. For rich content, apps had to either build app-specific APIs that couldn't be used in other apps or use workaround like sending images through Easy Share Action or the clipboard. With Android 7.1 (API level 25), the Android SDK includes the Commit Content API, which provides a universal way for IMEs to send images and other rich content directly to a text editor in an app. The API is also available in v13 Support Library as of revision 25.0.0. We recommend using the Support Library because it runs on devices as early as Android 3.2 (API Level 13), and it contains helper methods that simplify implementation. With this API, you can build messaging apps that accept rich content from any keyboard, as well as, keyboards that can send rich content to any app. The Google Keyboard and apps like Google Messenger support the Commit Content API in Android 7.1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal sometimes crashes when I open the app itself, or when I open a conversation. It started when I sat in school, about to die from boredom. A Signal contact sent me a picture of a bird with a message like &quot;Wow this bird is fat&quot;. I originally saw this in the preview on the Signal &quot;homepage&quot;, so I clicked the chat to show the picture and... Crash! After this I've had 1 more crash after opening Signal, so I think it's something with the picture. Steps to reproduce I have no clue really, but if I had to guess I would guess something like Receive a picture Open Signal Click the conversation before the picture has fully loaded Crash Bandicoot makes his entrance!

The apps can only be restored to work with deleting all data via the android settings. Expected result: The best would be support xlsx files to be supported.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description My friend made me aware of this as I'm never checking my account status via SMS, but it doesn't work for me neither. To check our account status, we have to send an SMS message to 13977, but Signal fails to deliver it. I tried sending it through the native Oneplus SMS app and it goes through just fine, with an immediate response. I can send an SMS to other people, though, so it has something to do with that number. (Signal adds +385 to it for Croatia, maybe that's it?) Steps to reproduce send an SMS to my provider through Signal Actual result: it doesn't go through, &quot;Failed to send&quot;, &quot;Some issues need your attention.&quot; Expected result: Message should go through and I should get a response.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports I was in a room without internet, i sent many messages (pictures) to another contact. Of course, textsecure/signal told me, that the messages wasn't sent. After that i was in the need to resent every message manual. The feature I'm missing is the possibility to groupselect/multiselect every message, which couldn't be sent and to resent it (dependent on the sent time). At the moment, it is only possible to select one message, click on the options and click on resent. If I select two or more entry's, this option is gone.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description So far in both of the last voice calls I have placed in Signal, the call started getting choppy and breaking up (after talking for a few minutes), then eventually went dead. When trying to re-initiate the call from either end, the Signal dialer shows up as a blank screen, with no hang up button on the bottom. Killing the app and trying to re-launch and re-dial doesn't fix the problem. Calling on WhatsApp immediately after worked fine, so it was not a data signal problem. Interestingly, the other party could not re-initiate the call either. (They were also on Android, I think, but I'm not sure.) Steps to reproduce Dial a call Talk for a few minutes until the call breaks up and then dies Try calling back Actual result: As described above Expected result: Calls should not drop when there is a good Wifi/cell signal, and even if the call drops, you should be able to call back immediately.

		Bug description Contact info and blocked lists sometimes fail to sync correctly on Desktop due to non-e164 phone number formats. Repro steps below demonstrate this for contact color syncing, though blocked number sync messages are similarly affected (see screenshots from Chrome's debugger). Steps to reproduce Edit a contact number so it includes punctuation, such as parentheses, spaces, or dashes. Refresh the contact info in Signal (see that the punctuated number is rendered in the conversation header). Change the contact's color in signal Actual result: Signal Desktop becomes confused and fails to save the change in contact info or blocked state. Expected result: Signal Desktop correctly updates the conversation color. Screenshots Device info Device: Galaxy Nexus Android version: 4.3 Signal version: 3.27.1 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/faf5c52bfecc2672a4b7fc9581e4e2c5 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Description: I cannot really call it a bug, more of a question. Steps to reproduce Register a Signal account &gt; Complete the registration Register Signal on another device and complete the registration Close the Signal application (with password enabled - but occurs also without password enabled) Send messages to the device with the Signal application closed Actual result: Well, like in the title, from what I've saw is that the messages are not received until the Signal application is opened. Is this the intended behavior? I mean I also have WhatsApp installed that can receive messages even when the application is closed from the task switcher. (it seems that it has a background process / service working, maybe this is why?) Note that i have Notifications enabled, Background Data is not restricted, I have good Internet connection and using Android 5.1.1. Expected result: Signal app should receive notifications / messages even when the application is closed. Thanks Device info: Device: Asus Zenfone Go Android version: 5.1.1 Signal version: 3.27.1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I'm experiencing an issue with regular unencrypted MMS messages. Signal will receive and display the MMS message normally however after another 3 days it will display the same message a second time even though the sender only sent it along once. I switched my phone back to the stock SMS app (Google Messenger) for a while to see if I could reproduce the same behavior. Google Messenger displays MMS message a single time as expected. This behavior has been consistent for me since I installed Signal and it does not seem to matter what phone OS (Android or iOS) or messaging application (iMessage, etc.) the sender is using. Possibly related issues: #6003 #5525 Steps to reproduce Get a friend to send along a single MMS message Notice that the MMS message is received and displayed by your phone normally Wait 3 days Notice that the MMS message is received and displayed by Signal a second time Actual result: Single MMS messages are being received and displayed twice by Signal. Expected result: MMS messages are only received and display once in Signal. Screenshots https://goo.gl/photos/jFyRb3jeS8s9sshZ8 Notice the sent and received dates of both images.

		Hi Developers at Open Whisper Systems,

Thanks for submitting your app for Android Auto. We reviewed your app, Signal Private Messenger, with package name org.thoughtcrime.securesms, and noticed some eligibility issues.

App status: Your app has not been accepted into Android Auto, and the update is not live on Google Play.

Eligibility issues by APK version:
APK Version(s)	Eligibility Issue
230	Your app does not support all of the required voice commands.
You can read more about how to support Voice Actions here: https://developer.android.com/training/auto/audio/index.html#support_voice
To be considered for Android Auto:

Make the necessary changes to your app.
Increment the version number of the upgraded APK.
Submit your app for another review.
Or, if you’d like to exclude your app from Android Auto:

Remove the Android Auto manifest entry from your APK code.
Sign in to your Developer Console and upload the new APK.
Click Submit update.
 I don't really know what voice commands they're referring to, and I don't have any way to test. It's blocking the release, so I'm going to remove android auto from the manifest entry for now. @snaggen are you willing to look into this?

		It would be nice to have a way to create a broadcast list to send msgs to those people who are part of this list individually. That helps to keep a number of people updated about some subject without having to put all of them together in a group.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description App floods phone with nonstop notifications after desktop texting Steps to reproduce Turn off your phone Open the Signal Private Messenger app Do a bunch of texting with the desktop app. Make sure to view all messages sent back at you. Turn on the phone Actual result: Watch your phone flood with notifications - buzzing, etc. It will last for many minutes. In my case, almost 5 full minutes. My phone died, I needed to do a bunch of texting via the webapp, and when I turned the app on again - I basically DOS'ed my own phone. It was going through messages slowly and individually, since it gets the message first, sends the notification, and only then marks its read/unread state. Expected result: From a user experience/product perspective, if I was opening the app after the phone was shutdown (or reception was reentered or whatever), I wouldn't want to see the buzzing, and have to wait. I'd simply see a single notification (or perhaps, no notification at all), and be able to use my phone immediately. tl;dr I shouldn't get a notification at all for a message if it was read on either platform. Screenshots (Not a single event, so no screenshot) Device info Device: Moto X Pure Signal version: 3.27.1 Link to debug log ( Can post this if necessary, but a little uncomfortable with posting the raw debug log atm )

		The one thing I miss mostly in Signal is the ability to see if the recipient has read my message or not. Like e.g. the blue checkmarks of WhatsApp. Could this be implemented, please? Can't believe I found no feature request like this.

		I'm on LineageOS for Nexus 6P -- latest build -- and I've found both Signal for Android and Signal Desktop do this despite my phone, my Mac, and my Windows 10 PC all having support for the newest emoji. Most irritating is that you can see the characters are un-split in notifications but when you go to the actual messaging window, they get broken into two -- for example, the &quot;male information desk&quot; character gets split into the female one and a &quot;male gender&quot; symbol. The &quot;male person with laptop&quot; get split into &quot;man&quot; and &quot;computer.&quot; Can we fix this?

W/Directory: Adding active token: +10005550000, REDACTED/+6A
 Where +1000555000 is the phone number of one of my contacts. There is one line per contact. Steps to reproduce Install Signal Sign in Connect Android device to desktop computer running the Android SDK Use adb shell to inspect logs. Impact If a device is rooted, any app running on the device can have access to read sensitive PII. If the user chooses to submit a bug report for any other unrelated app, even on a factory device, sensitive PII will be leaked. This PII may be uploaded to a phone manufacturer’s servers for crash report analysis, compromising the security of that user’s Signal contact list. How to mitigate The offending Log.i should be removed entirely. If that is not desirable, then some attempt must be made to write only a redacted or hashed version of the contacts' phone numbers.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When I am typing a message and moving the cursor around to fix a typo, every now and then the cursor is not responding as it should. You select a position in the message, try to delete a character (by hitting backspace). However not the character at which the cursor is pointing is removed, but the last one in the message. Continuing to correct most of the time results in a crash and restart of Signal. A work around is to exit the message and go back to the entry screen (message saved as draft) opening it again and continue the message. Not sure whether this is a quirk in the keyboard app or in Signal. I have not experienced this on my previous phone (Experia Z3 with Experia keyboard), so it might be keyboard related. Steps to reproduce Unfortunately I have not been able to come up with a sequence of steps to trigger this. A range of messages go OK and then for some reason this weird behaviour occurs. Actual result: Signal crashes Expected result: Signal should not crash on typing or correcting a message.

If the user does not realise this has happened and continues to use the linked device as well, repeated warnings may result. Expected result: Either the original account should be restored, or the user warned that the old account will be lost.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal Call takes a long time to initiate. See the video for what I mean. Steps to reproduce Sending a text message from phone A to phone B. B receives it immediately. Right after that I start a call from phone A to phone B. Actual result: It takes about 10 seconds to go from sonar sound to actual ringing sound. Expected result: Take as less time as the text push message to initiate the actual call.

		Hi ! I'm currently student, I use Silence daily and I think it should be a great idea if Silence can send pre-programmed text message with my android smartwatch. We could imagine a special menu in the settings parameters to add pre programmed text. PS: Sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language. Thanks for reply, Tristan

		I was invited to a group chat with some people I do know and a few I don't. I mistakenly added one of the phone numbers to an existing contact (yes, dumb, I know) but now I can't fix this error. I deleted the number in the Google Contacts app but if I tap &quot;View more fields&quot; it still shows under Signal Contacts and it still shows his name in Signal when it's not him. Is there no way to remove this field once Signal puts it in there??

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Since version 3.29.0, Signal crashes every time I launch it. Downgrading to 3.28.4 makes it work again, and allowed me to get the debug log. From the debug log: couldn't find &quot;libjingle_peerconnection_so.so&quot; So I'm thinking that some library's x86 version is missing from the apk. Update: It seems to be related to having Signal installed to /system/app. Steps to reproduce Install Signal to /system/app Remove Signal from /data/app (if present) Reboot Workarounds Either: Extract the libjingle_peerconnection_so.so from the apk to the lib/x86 folder where the apk is in.

		I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description There are no SAS word pairs visible when placing a call with WebRTC. This is not intended to be a critique of the crypto design or implementation of ZRTP but rather to reflect that two call recipients without knowledge of cryptography expressed concern that not having the SAS could result in possible interception of the calls. The reaction was not related to the technical details of the Signal protocol but rather a sudden, unexplained change in a ritual that accompanied previous usage of the service. At least one call recipient was using the latest iOS beta. I apologize if this is considered more to be a comment than a bug. Steps to reproduce Place WebRTC call Look for previously existing SAS codes Actual result: SAS codes are not visible and there is no explanation for why they are no longer there. Expected result: Either to see the SAS codes or, in the case that they have been purposefully removed, perhaps some other (transitional) visual indication of call security (particularly vis-a-vis tapping or middle attack interception in lieu of the old SAS word pairs.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When in the &quot;Update group&quot; screen, the button to tap to finish the update says &quot;CREATE GROUP&quot;, while it should say something like &quot;UPDATE&quot; or simply &quot;DONE&quot;. In general I don't like the &quot;Update group&quot; wording, it's confusing and doesn't pass the idea of an active action (modifying the group). &quot;Modify group&quot; or &quot;Manage group&quot; would be better. Moreover, after updating the group the string &quot;Updated the group.&quot; is shown to the modifying user in the conversation. I think it should be &quot;You updated the group.&quot;, for clarity and grammar. Steps to reproduce Create a group, enter its conversation and then open the &quot;Update group&quot; menu item. The &quot;CREATE GROUP&quot; thing is probably shown only on bigger displays. Try to reproduce with a Nexus 6 in an emulator.

(ERROR: 8550)&quot; You find the detailed error messages in the attached image. I don't think, that this kind of behavious is intended, because it is very confusing for the user. Especially after I closed the secondly opened chat window, I continued receiving these error messages. They stop appearing when I click on &quot;RESET SESSION&quot;.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Image compression is so high that images become unusable. Steps to reproduce send an image, taken with the standard camera from one device to another, no other steps involved Actual result: Image is compressed from 3264x2448px, 1.5MB to 408x306 px, 36.4KB. Image is not even close to being usable (in this case it is a foto of an time schedule). There is no option available to send the image in a way where it can be used on the recipient side. Seems to be related to #672 (didn't read though it as it is closed and I would expect that to mean resolved) Expected result: Images are received only with mild compression, not affecting the image visibly. Suggestion: Lower the compression rate and allow for the option to send uncompressed images (either via the image send dialogue or introduce an option to send all file types. Last would be fulfilled by #993, which is unfortunately locked for comment. Also I don't like to idea of my data being modified without the possibility to change this. Note: I did not add any further information as I expect this to be device independent. Further information can be provided if needed.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description The new unread separator looks very clunky (uses much screen space and thus notably reduces the message view &quot;capacity&quot;, which is likely to suck on small displays) and has not been adapted to the dark theme. (Since issues with the dark theme most often go along with new features being introduced, the PR contribution template could perhaps be enhanced to include a test with both themes?) Steps to reproduce use dark theme receive a new message open the corresponding conversation Actual result: Unread/last seen separator looks clunky and is hardly readable using dark theme Expected result: Separator is readable und less &quot;heavy&quot; (in terms of size, especially the height) Screenshots Device info Device: Lenovo Moto G4 Plus Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.30.0 Link to debug log (omitted, since unnecessary)

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports f-droid repo signed by WhisperSystems Please add an f-droid repo, so people without Google Play Store could have Signal updated on a regular basis. I totally understand and partly agree with @moxie0 's critcism of f-droid security. However, one can address those issues by creating his own f-droid repo and sign it with his own key. Projects that did so include Guardian Project. Information on how this can be done can be found here Why this is important Recently, a very important change has been made - it is now possible to use Signal without Gapps, and that also means that many new Signal users have to download the Signal apk off third party services, like apkpure, which is insecure and makes it impossible to update in a timely manner, which contradicts fundamental believes shared by WhisperSystems team in general and @moxie0 in particular. 👍 20

		I'm using Signal 3.29-6 and am unable to send secure messages or set auto-delete, at least to a recipient using Noise 3.30-2.0; I haven't tested users of other versions. There is apparently no way to synchronize versions if that is the problem. Please restore secure messaging and auto-delete. (Noise doesn't appear to have a place to file bugs.) Thank you

		I have: [v ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [v ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I have a dual sim phone running CM13. Signal is set up to replace the default messaging app. The account is set up with the number of my primary sim. In the Android settings sim 2 is set as the default for SMS. When I send an SMS Signal defaults to sim 1 for sending; I have to longpress the send button and select sim 2 to correct that. Even worse, when replying to an SMS received ob sim 2, the app also defaults to sim 1 and sends the reply through that sim. Signal should (1) default to the sim set in the Android settings for sending SMS messages, and (2) use the number that received the original SMS when replying.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description If a message fails to send, the red exclamation mark takes one to the details view where the send again button is located. In earlier Signal versions the button disappeared after pressing it and some spinning element or dancing dots appeared, signalling that something is happening. Since a few versions now nothing happens visually after pressing even though Signal is trying to resend the message. This is confusing and leads to pressing the button again and again because nothing seems to be happening. Steps to reproduce Send a message that fails to send for whatever reason click for details press resend button Actual result: Nothing signals the user that something is happening, button stays active all the time Expected result: Deactivate the button and signal that something is happening Device info Device: Huawei Nexus 6p Android version: 7.1.1 Signal version: 3.29.6 👍 2

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description While I was writing a message, several messages came in (media and also text). Suddenly Signal froze, shortly after the phone froze and rebootet. Now I cannot start Signal anymore. It crashes instantly at the start. Steps to reproduce No idea how to simulate my phones/Signals state Start Signal -&gt; Crash Actual result: Signal crashes instantly and does not load Expected result: Signal should work as expected (in this case it should be able to handle the error, whatever error it is actually) Device info Android version: LineageOS 14.1 Signal version: 30.3.4 ###Additional information: Maybe this is of relevance: I see a lot of websocketconnection in the crash log but actually I am using play services...

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Using &quot;video calling beta&quot; from an Alcatel TCL 5010D to make a call to a Blackberry Classic with no-google-play-services, on the Alcatel appears this error: &quot;Number not registered - The number you dialed does not support secure voice!&quot;. Both devices are running Signal beta 3.30.4. Alcatel has explicitly enabled &quot;video calling beta&quot; feature. Blackberry has it implicitly enabled, as per moxie0's comment in #6272 (&quot;You don't see that settings, it's on by default for you&quot;). [btw, before beta Signal 3.30.3, the Blackberry showed &quot;Login failed!&quot; when trying to place a call; now, from 3.30.3, no more &quot;Login failed!&quot;]. If, instead, I call from the Blackberry the Alcatel, on the Blackberry it seems all ok, ringing tone, but the Alcatel doesnt ring, and shows a missed call just after the Blackberry stops the ringing tone, manually or because of the timeout. Texts and attachments work ok on both directions (A-&gt;B, B-&gt;A). Alcatel device can place and receive audio calls correctly to/from other Signal accounts. Blackberry device has the same behaviour as detailed here with other Signal accounts. Steps to reproduce call the Blackberry from the Alcatel, and viceversa Device A info Device: Alcatel Pixi4 5010D Android version: 6.0 Signal version: beta 3.30.4 Device B info Device: Blackberry Classic Android version: 4.3 Signal version: beta 3.30.4 Link to debug logs Alcatel calling Blackberry mostly there is, it seems to me, not so much interesting data in the debug log: http://gist.github.com/ea2bc9fb1a190aa5c6a6a4eebfd2feb7 sometimes, something appears [e.g. handleNoSuchUser, I suppose]: http://gist.github.com/f6500cf47918bfa440fb9f665c3ac650 Blackberry calling Alcatel [last 2 account's digits edited to 00 for privacy] http://gist.github.com/6276fdd23691660ad81f3ea340a4f5fa

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports As is now it is impossible to disable heads-up notifications, to me, and many others, this isn't all that great as they are pretty obnoxious and they block out other parts of the screen when doing anything else than signal, ofcourse this is my opinion so an option to disable/enable them would be great. 👍 3

Signal was already set as the default messaging app. Changing to Messages, then going through the steps works as expected. Something with the assumption that Signal is not default?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Feature description Most of signal messages I send to my buddies only get delivered( or calls tried notified) when their signal app is opened. This was the case with me until I moved to AOSP and with the new solution for non play services users, now the messages come in very swiftly even when the app is not in foreground. All my buddies are on stock rom and I understand there may be issues with play services configuration etc.. But not everyone are geeks and everyone cannot move to AOSP for different reasons and not everyone can or wants to contact support with debug log when there are good alternatives for instant messaging already installed on their phones. So if the affected users have ability to choose between type of notifying services (GCM PUSH or the WEBSOCKET one), it would simply overcome the issues of no/sluggish notifications and message delivery. 👍 5

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description It has happened a few times now that while I'm having a call I suddenly stop hearing the other party's voice after a while (~several minutes) but they can still hear my voice. So far this has happened only when I'm having a call with Signal iOS. But I haven't had long calls with another Signal Android so nothing to say about that. Steps to reproduce Call Signal iOS device Talk for some time Actual result: Suddenly I stop hearing the other party's voice but they can still hear my voice. Expected result: Both parties can hear each other for the duration of the whole call Device info Android Device: Moto G4 Play Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.30.4 iOS Device: iPhone 4S iOS version: 9.3.5 Signal version: 2.7.1 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3d87be38fce2a11107b10164322a96bc https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c0102e788ffd853143dbd1ec78a213f1 I guess the relevant parts are before I disconnect the call after I notice that I can't hear the other party anymore Unfortunately, I don't have logs from iOS Related issues In #4532, #6140, #6271 the other party can't hear anything but it seems that the silence is there from the beginning of the call, not after talking successfully for several minutes.

At this point signal inserts a previous word from my message, appends it to the location below my cursor and deletes from it. This causes it to take about twice as long to delete any word, as it inserts a word on first delete press. Steps to reproduce Type a message hit delete notice that there are extra characters inserted that were not there before delete was pressed. Actual result: A word from previously in the message is now before the cursor.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description My mom has a Moto G3 and she often leaves the screen on when she's in a conversation with me while she's watching TV or whatever. The problem is that while the phone always beeps when she gets a new message, the beep is often really quiet/short when the screen is on and she's already in a conversation with me. &quot;In-conversation notifications&quot; is enabled, which is why it beeps at all. However, it seems the message is marked as &quot;read&quot; too quickly, so the beep is interrupted. My mom is old and she just can't hear the beep which means she can't respond right away when I'm texting her at the supermarket or whatever. Steps to reproduce Receive a message when your screen is on with the chat open, make sure &quot;In-conversation notifications&quot; is enabled in the settings Most of the time the notification beep is really short, which makes it easy to miss Actual result: The beep is seemingly interrupted Expected result: The beep is fully played, just like you'd expect it to Device info Moto G3 Latest non-beta Signal Android 6.0.1 Link to debug log Don't think this is necessary, but if it is just tell me and I'll post one

		Debug logs: https://gist.github.com/a2c764a64dcd5c6b0b7cb297554d4c46 Chrome Version 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit) I use multiple user profiles simultaneously to keep work and personal content separate. : installed extensions: Cisco WebEx Extension 1.0.8 Google Docs 0.9 Google Docs Offline 1.4 Google Sheets 1.1 Google Slides 0.9 LastPass: Free Password Manager 4.1.41 Signal Private Messenger 0.32.1 Tampermonkey 4.2.7 OS version: Windows 10 Enterprise Version 1607, OS build 14393.693 Behavior: After upgrading from a windows 7 machine to windows 10, Signal has become unreliable. I see the message popup indicating I've gotten a new message, and about 80% of the time when I click the popup, my chrome instance is highlighted, but the signal instance does not appear. I've enabled, disabled, removed, re-added, re re re,moved , re re added etc a number of times with no change in behavior. Once I have the window open and working, it will continue to work as long as I do not close the window. once I close the window, it's anyone's guess whether it will come back again. Sometimes I have the signal icon showing in the control panel open programs list, where I have attempted to bookmark the signal icon so it is easily accessible: If I hover over the icon and I can see the program preview, signal will work as expected. If the icon will not show up, or hovering does not show the program preview, there is literally nothing I can do to convince the window for signal to show itself. It is obviously running, because I still get the message alerts- but the actual message window can not be accessed. I attempted to go to the extension, and use the &quot;create shortcut&quot; option from the extension window. This will very occasionally work, but it's rare. the shortcut mainly gives me a &quot;working&quot; icon, and then does nothing. I can also go to the &quot;view in store&quot; and select &quot;launch app&quot; from the chrome store. Again, occasionally this will work, but almost never. mostly it just does nothing. I have been paying attention, but I can not find any consistency for when it will work vs when it will not work. It does not seem more likely to work after a reboot or before, And I believe it has randomly started to work in the middle of a browser session (though I'm not 100% sure). The only thing that Has changed about my configuration is the OS version, so I'm sure there is something environmental causing this- but I have not been able to narrow down what triggers the behavior. One more interesting thing I just discovered: It's more likely to work if I use one chorme profile than another. when it fails to work, it always highlights the shortcut to the chrome profile that works less often. The extension shows as installed on both. Perhaps this is a strange side effect of windows 10 + profiles in chrome?

		Hi, If I make a call (both devices WebRTC enabled) and hang up immediately (before the recipient's phone rings) I often (but not always) get to Signal's login screen and have to enter the password again. I am not sure what happens. Perhaps Signal crashes and re-starts. Found with build 3.31.0 for Android.

		We've got some improvements with group-related messages, thanks for that. Still from time to time I get &quot;Group updated.&quot; message in the group conversation. It's very confusing: who updated what? The string name is GroupUtil_group_updated, called just two times in GroupUtil.java. It should be changed in something more precise, like: &quot;UserX changed the group name from X to Y&quot;. (It's just an example, maybe group name changes are already precise, the point is that I don't know what triggers the &quot;Group updated&quot; message!)

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I ended a new call by pressing the hangup button instantly after the starts (sonar sound just started playing the first time) Then the call was ended (no more sonar sound) but the WebRtcCallActivity was not closed. I just sat there waiting for nothing(?) After letting it ring some seconds (2 sonar pings) The hangup works as expected. And afterwards the this bug is not reproducible. But leads to this crash: #6348 (comment) Not sure yet, if this is the same issue... (will merge into 6348 if so) Steps to reproduce start Web RTC call press hangup immediatly after the button ist visible maybe helpful for repro: the recipient's Signal was not receiving any incoming call, cause it got and stayed killed after Debugging (Android Emulator) Actual result: Sometimes WebRtcCallActivity stays active, nothing more happens Expected result: WebRtcCallActivity gets closed Device info Device : Sony E5823 (E5823) Android : 6.0.1 (2701308494, 32.2.A.0.253) Memory : 36M (16.24% free, 512M max) Memclass: 192 OS Host : BuildHost App : Signal 3.31.2 Link to debug log After cleaning out the leaks, here you go: https://gist.github.com/McLoo/0074df6170a3b8d6856d5c69c89b7122#file-gistfile1-txt-L360 (I left WebRtcCallActivity and the Convo by back-button. Then locked Signal, to access the &quot;Submit Debug log&quot; faster) https://gist.github.com/McLoo/e5c6c93596a632b5dece6942fcbf1179#file-gistfile1-txt-L337 (left WebRtcCallActivity and the Convo by back-button, then Settings-&gt;Submit)

		Bug description When using the power button of the device the FLAG_SECURE is ineffective and the screenshot appears with the information. This is actually a bug on Android platform and have been fixed only in versions above 7.x. My goal with this issue is to understand if there may be implemented a workaround for earlier versions of android like change to a blank fragment during the onPause() or onStop() event. In the API there is supposedly a function that would allow to generate a custom thumbnail but it's never triggered. I opened a ticket in Google regarding this but so far nobody assigned the ticket (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=235166) Steps to reproduce Navigate to a particular screen with information Press the power button of the device to lock the screen. Go to the recents list and confirm that the information is shown on the screenshot Screenshots Device info Device: Nexus 5x Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.30.4

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Family uses Signal to communicate but Teenager has limited cellular data (e.g. used up monthly quota on YouTube). Other family members cannot send messages to Teenager in a timely fashion without knowing in advance whether Teenager currently has cellular data available. Steps to reproduce Attempt to send Signal message to Teenager Message is sent fine (one tick) Hours later, notice that Teenager has not replied, and message still has only one tick Manually send message via long-press SMS Actual result: Teenager doesn't actually receive the message until it has been manually been sent via SMS Expected result: An app setting should allow automatic fallback to SMS/MMS if the message has not been delivered to the recipient after N minutes. (Signal would ideally need a way to identify when two copies are received, one via SMS/MMS and one via Signal when cellular or Wifi permits the original message to arrive) For many people, the encrypted nature of Signal messages is less important than a single, reliable messaging app, and these people are nonetheless important for growing the Signal user base. (BTW, I found some old bugs about fallback if the senders internet is intermittent, but not the receivers)

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I was eager to try out the new non gcm functionality, got an android phone and promptly disabled the Google Play Apps (precise lising below). Trying to sign up for Signal resulted in a failure, as the App requires me for some reason to update the Play Services before continuing. This locks me out. [I dont think this is wanted behavior. Looking into src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/RegistrationActivity.java, it looks like ConnectionResult.SERVICE_DISABLED is supposed to be treated as MISSING but that doesn't seem to work.] Steps to reproduce Disable all 3 Google Play &quot;Core Apps&quot; (listed below) Open a freshly installed Signal Type in Country and Phone Number and press Register Actual result: A pop up appears: Update Google Play Services Signal won't run unless you update Google Play Services. This is impossible as they are intentionally disabled and unwanted as we want to use Websocket push. Expected result: The registration happens and Signal sets up so that gcmdisabled true is set. Signal can be used. (Treat this as if the Google Play service components were just MISSING) Device info Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.31.4 Stock Rom. Newly of the shelf bought phone. disabled apps: com.google.android.gms com.android.vending com.google.android.gsf Debug log not available as signup is impossible. A fix would be greatly appreaciated, as it would allow to quickly setup an android burner phone for Signal without much technical sophistication. 👍 5

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Since updating to Signal 3.29.6 I get, several times a day, a failure notification saying: &quot;Permanent Signal communication failure! Signal was unable to register with Google Play Services. Signal messages and calls...&quot; Also I no longer receive messages unless i open Signal. I dont have Google apps on my phone but before updating (which i was forced to do) signal was working fine with MicroG core. Since then I have updated microG core, but this has not fixed the issue. I guess I am going to be told to report this issue to microG devs rather than here, but since it's a signal update what resulted in this issue, I would like to know if we are gonna see Signal go further into the road of being incompatible with phones not monitored by google. We are forced to update Signal too often. (not too often would be once every 1 or 2 years). if every update is going to bring problems, I will move on Steps to reproduce normal Signal usage. The failure notifications usually come when network state changes and when opening Signal Actual result: Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) Expected result: receiving notifications of messages without having to open the app. not receiving notifications of communication failure with Google.

		When joining a large group, where most of the users are not in any user's contacts list, it's very annoying to see messages coming from phone numbers. They are difficult to recognize, remember, and associate with a name. There should be a way for users to specify a name to be shown when in a conversation with an user that doesn't have the number in his/her contacts list. When the number is in the contact list, the contact list name has to be displayed. This has to be optional.

		Bug description I was using Signal SMS App for month until today. I wanted to write a SMS and suddenly i could not send any messages anymore. So i decided to reinstall the app but after reinstalling i could not even register. At the very beginning after you type in your phone number at signal i cannot get through step 1. After a while Signal shows me the message &quot;Connectivity Error&quot;.. I already deinstalled Signal a couple of times and deleted the cache of every google app. Of course i also deleted the cache of signal but it will not work anymore. I made two screenshots in Catlog wich i uploaded down below. Device: Samsung Galaxy S5 Cyanogenmod 13 version:** 6.0.1 Signal version:** 3.31.4

		When using Signal without gapps and with a passphrase two foreground activities are shown in the notification area: one for the &quot;Background connection&quot;, the other just says &quot;Signal is unlocked&quot;, and it's needed to cache the passphrase I guess. These are taking a lot of screen estate. I'd suggest to join them in a single foreground activity.

This happened a couple of minutes ago. While chatting with a couple of friends via Signal Desktop, I noticed that in the taskbar it said &quot;Signal (1)&quot;, implying a new message is there. But somehow it didn't show up. So I took my phone to have another look. Turns out I just received a message from Febr. 28th. How? oO I managed to grab a debug log right after I read the text message on my phone. I am unable to obtain one from the other phone. It is probably useless anyways.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When a new user installs Signal, Signal notifies all of their contacts who have Signal that Signal has been installed. This is an invitation to communication which may be unwanted or long outdated. Steps to reproduce Install Signal Get messages from ex-lovers or business associates you have no interest in communicating with Actual result: Signal, without advising me, tells everyone with my phone number stored in their phone that I have installed Signal. Expected result: When I install Signal, it should be my choice if Signal tells everyone who has my phone number, intentionally or not, that I've done so. Screenshots Notification from an OKCupid date 8 years ago. Two suggestions: Allow the new user to choose if these notifications are generated. Only notify a contact that Signal is available when composing a new message to a contact with Signal installed. 👍 1 👎 1

		Thanks for improving the voice note feature. When raising the phone to the ear, voice notes are now played through the earpiece. Maybe it would be good now to also disable the touch functionality of the screen while one is listening to the voice note. Right now it can happen, that the ear is pressing buttons. Steps to reproduce: start playback of voice note raise phone to ear listen to the voice note through the earpiece expected result: during the playback through the earpiece touch functionality of screen is disabled actual result: ear is accidentally pressing buttons on the touch screen 👍 2

		Improve local storage encryption. Now only the content of the messages is encrypted. If forensics can bypass androids FDE, they can collect metadata. Please don't assume that androids FDE is safer than local encryption implemented right. Android FDE is light years away from ios and even ios is not bulletproof. please read on the discoussion forum: https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/passphrase-encryption-only-for-message-contents/917 Moxie commented he would want to phase it out in favor of android fde. Wich would be a mistake.

		Bug description I opened Signal after an automatic update to 4.1.0. It asked me to re-initialize my phone number as if it were a new install. Once it opened, my message history was completely gone. I re-imported from the sms database, and it only imported everything from before I installed Signal, nearly 6 months ago. I attempted to import from a text backup to see if the update had made one, but it was not found. It appears the message history is lost. Steps to reproduce Allow Signal to auto update via the play store. Open Signal It will ask you to re-initialize your phone number. Upon successful initialization, find all of your messages lost. Actual result: All of my Signal message history was gone. I was able to re-import SMS messages from before installing Signal the first time, over 6 months ago. Expected result: I would still have my SMS message history.

Bug description I cannot have two android devices or two mobile phones logged in to the same identity at the same time. Steps to reproduce Open up the app Attempt to identify yourself without a SIM present. Actual result: No options to use this app Expected result: Identify via ((mms)), ((email)) ((SIP/VOIP Provider)) ((Google Voice)) ((OAuth Provider)) ((scan QR code from existing device)). You should also be able to link identities accross different ID providers (multiple phone numbers + email address, for example) once signed in by using a device scan.

		This one is simple. Currently we have 15 different conversation colors. This seems somewhat limited for a modern app. Anybody familiar with Textra's extensive color picker knows what I'm talking about. 30 or more colors would be nice. A good way to determine a maximum number of colors is if they start becoming too indistinct from one another. This is especially useful as Signal gains more users and our contact lists grow. 👍 3 🎉 5

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports I received a message today, and after reading it the &quot;new message&quot; notification stays there, even if I close and re-open Signal. It remains there even when I FC Signal and reopen it. It could be a duplicate of #6270 but I'm unsure since I did nothing with the SMS database.

		I know this is a duplicate of #614 but I am unable to post there, and I was wondering if this would be a feasible solution for the problem mentioned there. Could you look at using the signal desktop repository as a combined android app repository specifically for tablets and other currently non supported devices. I know this is possible in some circumstances because, DuckieTV (github.com/SchizoDuckie/DuckieTV) also use a single JavaScript repository, but they compile it for multiple OS like Android, Linux, Windows, OSX and a chrome add on. I think they do this with the help of AngularJS. Thanks

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Sometimes when I send a video to my mother's Moto G3, the video either Just sits there spinning Starts loading and then halfway through it goes back to spinning again I have no idea why this happens, the phone has plenty of free memory and the delete timer is set to 1 day so the chat isn't bloated at all. This has been happening for several months now and it's getting really annoying. Steps to reproduce Receive a video (It doesn't happen every time) Wait for it to finish loading... Oh wait! It never does! Restart the device It now works just fine Actual result: Videos get stuck downloading until a restart Expected result: Videos should never get stuck Device info Device : motorola MotoG3 (osprey_reteu) Android : 6.0.1 (2, MPIS24.107-55-2-5) Memory : 31M (14.53% free, 256M max) Memclass: 96, low-mem device OS Host : ilclbld36 App : Signal 3.30.4 In the most recent debug log below: App : Signal 4.1.0 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/494993a950189778dc6e6d7f469d1e58 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0c21e2e84df4dcc8a7a3ecb3af8a34b7

		For the past few days I have been having a strange issue. I convinced my fiance to use signal as both a messaging and texting app. But lately I cannot send my messages as text. I think you should enable the ability to switch off signal messages manually since the automatic is buggy. It sucks because I use signal every day.

		I tried downloading the officially published apk, but fingerprint does not match. I tried using various browsers and asked a friend to try as well. So I think I am not under an attack. I downloaded Signal-website-release-4.1.0.apk and the SHA256 fingerprint I get is: d7accd1465968607e4df3112c39bfc98eb0674c3a9cb4146a47d935d871e84f6
 I used shasum -a 256 Signal-website-release-4.1.0.apk. On the website it is written that the fingerprint should be: 29:F3:4E:5F:27:F2:11:B4:24:BC:5B:F9:D6:71:62:C0

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal is unable to send or receive messages over an LTE / 3G connection if NetGuard is active simultaneously on the device. This behaviour persists even if Signal is given full access to both WiFi and cellular connections in NetGuard. This behaviour is unique to cellular data connections. Signal works properly on WiFi while NetGuard is active. It is not yet clear whether the problem is in Signal or in NetGuard. If it turns out to be the latter, then a help / faq page saying &quot;NetGuard breaks Signal, there's just no way to make it work, here are alternatives / workarounds&quot; would be a good idea. Running without NetGuard or a similarly capable alternative is not a workaround, as that would permit other apps to quickly gobble up mobile data (which, in this case, is expensive and in extremely limited supply). Steps to reproduce Debug log attached, generated as follows: While an active WiFi connection is present, close and then start Signal. Verify that NetGuard is set normally (firewall is on, Signal has full access for both WiFi and cellular modes). Move outside the range of the WiFi connection. Device automatically switches to LTE connection. Attempt to send a plain text message in Signal. Actual result: Get a &quot;failed to send message&quot; error. Expected result: Message is sent, shows 1 checkbox (sent), shortly thereafter shows 2 checkboxes (received). Turn off NetGuard entirely. Try sending the message again in signal. Actual result: Message is sent correctly. Expected result: No change. Re-enable NetGuard and move back into WiFi range. Actual result: Signal works normally.

		There are situations where the device where Signal is installed can't directly receive SMS messages, but the users can receive the message on another device/service. Some devices do not have a sim card slot but the users owns another phone that can receive messages. Other users want to register with a phone number bought from a service like Twilio. In these cases it is difficult to register with the current procedure. I propose this kind of solution: After the 2 minutes SMS timeout, a screen is shown to the user, asking to manually enter the code receives via SMS. The screen also have a clear button that says &quot;I didn't receive any sms&quot;, or something like that. If the user taps on &quot;I didn't receive the SMS&quot;, the current voice verification screen is shown. The vast majority of the users will never see this screen. I think there are more users which can receive messages on a different device than users that try to register, expect to receive the message, but then something does not work. 👍 2

		I would appreciate it if it would be possible to sign up without giving you a phone number. This would be another advantage over WhatsApp. Of course, Signal promises not to save it but I still can't understand why I should install a crypto messenger and then have my phone number transferred to some server somewhere in the world. If it is necessary that every user has a number, users who do not want to use their own number could get another, randomly created number (which starts with 000, for example). There is another crypto messenger, &quot;Hoccer&quot;, with which this is already possible.

In BetterBatteryStats I see under Partial Wakelocks that org.thoughtcrime.securesms.job.UpdateApkJob is burning lots of CPU time (40-50% on a mostly idle phone), waking the CPU from Deep Sleep. The name suggests that this is about updating the APK. If so, it would be great if this job would only be started when the phone is online. Device info Android version: 4.2.2 Signal version: 4.2.4

Expected result: Call should be established rather quickly.

		https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-only-complete-prs-and-test-them states that folks shouldn't submit work-in-progress PRs. That seems like a very bad idea to me. WIP PRs are very useful for answering questions like: Am I heading down the right direction with respect to this code's design? I implemented part of this change, if I finish the rest would it be accepted? I'm stuck with such-and-such an error, how can I solve it? I've made a change on this line but I'm not 100% sure it's correct, can someone confirm? All of these questions have to go somewhere. It might as well be somewhere where it's easiest to answer - in a Pull Request where you have the full diff available to contextualize all discussion. Does this requirement exist because people would submit incomplete PRs that made tests fail, etc.? In that case, I propose the text be amended to say something like &quot;if submitting a Pull Request that's not ready for merging, prefix its title with [WIP].&quot; 👍 6

		I have seen various groups chat bugs here, but this one I couldn't find so far: After exporting all messages and then importing them on a new device, messages from group charts appear under the account who sent them instead of in the group. Without the context of the conversation many such messages however are completely useless and, worse, even mess up the chats with the individual contracts. Is there some way to preserve group chats when moving device? If not this seems to be a serious bug that drastically limits the usefulness of group chats. 👍 1

For incoming calls, the crash happens immediately when the ringing would normally start. When I restart Signal afterwards, I see that there is a missed call. For outgoing calls, the crash happens immediately, after the call screen is shown, before the ringing starts. Steps to reproduce Be called on Signal Android by a Signal Android device (no need to pick up or even have the screen active) Alternatively, call a Signal Android device. Actual result: Signal crashes immediately. Expected result: Signal should not crash and establish a call. Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy S2 (I9100) Android version: 7.1.1.

		Signal version 4.3.2 Android 7.1.2 Pixel XL, not rooted Google Play Service 10.2.98 I had a prior conversation with a contact today. About 20 minutes ago I tried messaging that same contact after leaving my office, Single immediately went into a crash loop and threw the screen allowing me to report feedback (I've reported it a few times with some descriptive text). The crash still happened after I deleted the cache to Signal. I set the device to airplane mode and reopened Signal. I was able to open the app without a crash. Opening up the conversation with said friend I could see the message I had sent was still in a pending state (3 dots animating). I long held on the message, deleted it, killed the app (app switcher swipe), turned off airplane mode, reopened the app. No crash. Again I attempted to message my friend, again hit a boot crash. Repeated my airplane mode steps, then went back to Signal while online and tried to send a message to a different contact. That worked fine, no crash, double check marks. I left it alone. After about 30 minutes said contact tried messaging me again and the app in the background threw the Android crash submit feedback popup box. The airplane mode trick no longer works, nor does clearing cache. Also my session through the Chrome extension is running fine. I can see the last message I received from the friend was &quot;Yeah, k&quot; before any further messages from me or him would cause the app to give up on life. At this time I was able to logcat the crash in the state that it is in now and attaching thta at the end of this bug report. I am assuming my only option at this point is to clear app data to get out of this bad state. bitmoji

		Just started suddenly. My app notifications will not go off unless I go to the app and reopen it. It'll then decide to tell me someone sent me a message X # of minutes ago. Was working fine all day and almost all the time until a couple hours ago. I've checked all the settings and notifications are set to go off. My desktop app is not on on any of my computers either so that's not interfering. It's not being automatically marked as read, it's just simply not notifying me unless I reopen the app. I've restarted the phone and the app is updated according to the play store. The only person I use this app with is also a verified Signal user. I do not force close this app with the task killer like other apps. I always have it open in the background. I'm using a Galaxy S5 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) App Version 4.3.2 Debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/938f007e37803d845a5e54a40d257711 👍 2

		Can't register without google play services. If play services is disabled after registration, the app gives warning notifications &quot;Permanent Signal com....&quot; &quot;Signal was unable to register with google play services&quot; (although the app still works). Text delivery is sporadic and unreliable. Do you people even test the app before putting it on the market? Don't publish an app with a big press release saying that it will work without google play services if you haven't even tested it and it, in fact, doesn't work. Pathetic. How is it that Telegram has so many more features, and works so successfully, yet your app doesn't? Incompetent developers. 👍 1 👎 2

		First of all, I've never come across another app that won't allow the user to bypass the &quot;update play services&quot; popup by clicking outside the popup, and then work as normal, if indeed the app doesn't REQUIRE play services (but still attempts to use it for something). Signal registration fails completely if play services isn't the latest possible version, even if the user has it disabled. You should allow the user to click outside that popup and proceed without updating/using play services if in fact Signal works without it. That's what most apps do if they don't require play services. Second, your comment about Signal being designed to work if play services isn't installed on the device at all is completely facetious. ALL android devices have this installed. The only way to get it completely deleted is to root the device, which thanks to google, can only be done by using third-party apps like Kingroot which is made by unknown people in China and introduces a huge security risk. Therefore, it's only feasible to DISABLE play services, google services framework, the play store, and google account manager. Third, you ask what is the benefit of making play services disabled &quot;if it is some kind of malware.&quot; Well, (1) play services constantly phones home to a google domain at 1e100.net. It has complete permissions to your device and, knowing how google is, most likely uploads the user's contacts and files, and may even record audio and video without the user knowing. The mere fact that it has permission to do all of that is a security risk in itself (and opens a backdoor for the government to collude with google to develop spy tools for Android phones). (2) Play services is constantly updating, which I have found can cause major incompatibility issues and brick phones, since google doesn't test the update on every phone in use in the marketplace. Google forces the updates on users, which is unethical and unnecessary if the old version is working. So, hopefully you can see why play services is a major problem. Basically, google treats peoples' phones as if it belonged to google, controlling what can run on the device, forcing updates, accessing god knows what, and constantly phoning home, as any user with a firewall app can see. They act as if they are only &quot;licensing&quot; the phone to the user, rather than the user actually owning the phone and controlling it. Honestly, I would think any developer working on a privacy/security product like Signal would have grasped this already.

		Pardon me if this had been already discussed, but I only found one relevant issue, #838. Since TS only supports phone numbers as an identity mechanism, it means the telcos (and hence governments) have all the metadata they need to identify users. Thy don't even care about the communication contents - see Why Metadata Matters | Electronic Frontier Foundation and Using Metadata to find Paul Revere. Thus TextSecure offers a false sense of security. I'd love to be proven wrong if perhaps I misunderstood the underlying handshake and transport mechanisms (SMS, GCM).

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Since March 13, you can now download Signal as an .apk from the official website. This is partial done for people who have no Google Play installed on their devices. A part of this group does not have Google Play installed because they don't want to have proprietary software on their device. Fortunately, you can use Signal without Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging but unfortunately, the proprietary libraries are still included in Signal's build. Some of these are:     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:9.6.1'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:9.6.1'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-places:9.6.1'
 In my eyes it makes sense to add a fully free and open source gradle build flavor to Signal which builds get published on the website instead of the default Google Play release. If this is done, F-Droid can reproduce and distribute the official binaries of Signal by OpenWhisperSystems. Reference thread in F-Droid's forum: https://forum.f-droid.org/t/signal-discussion-about-google-play-alternative/95 👍 6

		I have: [ x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description [Caveat] Please note, I'm not entirely sure this is a bug, as I could see the utility of this behavior, depending on the use-case. When I'm in a group conversation with (in this case) two other users, and I've set the disappearing messages timer to 1 day, if that amount of time passes and no one has sent any messages to the group, not only will the messages disappear (as expected), but the entire group will disappear, no longer showing in the contacts list. Steps to reproduce Create a messaging group with two other Signal users Set disappearing messages timer to 1 day Exchange messages as expected Note that your group appears in your contacts list Allow all messages to expire, with no messages being sent or received by the group for the duration of the disappearing messages timer Note that the created group has disappeared Actual result: Note that the created group has disappeared Expected result: Noting my caveat above, the expected result would normally be that the created group does not disappear without the user manually deleting it. Work-arounds The following work-arounds were found to negate this behavior (assuming you don't want to disable the disappearing messages functionality): When first creating the group, prior to setting the disappearing messages timer, send one message to the group, serving to anchor the group in your contacts list. Once that message has been sent, set the disappearing messages timer, which will automatically delete subsequent messages (excluding the anchor). It is unknown if this will serve to anchor the group with recipients, especially if they manually delete the anchor. Assuming you're using the desktop client, where the group will not disappear once the timer has expired (but messages will), send a message to the group. This will serve to recreate the group on the mobile app. The group will disappear on the mobile app should the timer expire again. App State Signal messages and calls registered SMS/MMS Enabled Notifications on Passphrase on, Screen security on Theme Dark, Language Default Message trimming off 3rd party app info unknown, other than being Signal registered Device info Device: Huawei Nexus 6P Android version: 7.1.2, build N2G47H Signal version: 4.4.0 beta Link to debug log Bug(?) was not noticed in a timely fashion, so no debug log was generated.

Current sounds (sonar sound and ping when call is established/terminated) are by my opinion too aggressive. They contain too much high tones. My proposal is, to use more soft sounds. My proposal is also to replace sonar sound with something more similar to ringing... for instance instead of sonar there should be &quot;slow&quot; ringing and when ringing starts, there should be regular ringing (as it is now). Another proposal is also to measure bandwidth and quality of call. When quality of call starts to get to low, user should get a very soft beep-beep-beep sound, so he/she is alerted there are problems with bandwidth. This should also be visible on the screen. If connection drops (because of bad connection), it should be re-establisher automatically - user should be alerted of this re-establishing by sound and by screen text. Anyway, I am also noticing some problems with bandwidth consumption. Are there any plans that when bad network conditions occur, codec automatically &quot;switches&quot; to lower quality? I am not talking about VBR codecs, just that maybe there should be two codecs used - one for normal bandwidth and another when bandwidth is lower. 👍 2 👎 2

		Signal should remember that you've verified safety numbers with a contact. When you run into a friend, it's easy to forget whether you've done this or not, and anything to make it more convenient increases security. Some users add a check mark to the contact's name, but this is a terrible solution. This change shouldn't require any new options or settings. It would be nice: for both users to see a &quot;Your safety number with XXX was verified [/ not verified]&quot; message in the conversation in the style that you already see e.g. &quot;Your safety number with XXX has changed&quot; to see an indication of whether the safety number for any given contact has been verified in &quot;Conversation settings &gt; verify safety number&quot;, and perhaps also additional info about it e.g. when verification occurred, how ... to have some ongoing visual indication of the verification status within each conversation (maybe the lock and checkmarks could become green instead of grey? or there could be a different color in the title bar or background color?) I'm guessing it's unwise, though, to prevent someone from re-verifying a safety number with a contact in case, e.g., their threat model includes physical tampering Thanks for considering this! 👍 4

		As it is now possible to send arbitrary files within Signal -&gt; Attachments -&gt; file (Still open issue #993), it would be even better, if it would be possible to share this files via the &quot;share menue&quot; within other apps. As far as I know, Signal has to be linked as possible receiverapps for any filetype. Sorry if this should be monitored within #993, but as this is closed, I did not see a chance to connect this request with this issue. Regards 👍 5

		@moxie0 Thank you for finally implementing #993 with Signal version 4.5.3. You locked the #993 issue some time ago, so that I (who reported it) was unable to close it. I want to ask you to close it, and also this issue. I want to inform you that some people collected a bounty for the implementation of arbitrary-file-attachments. You now can claim the bounty (please see Bountysource page https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1464832-suggestion-allow-arbitrary-file-types-txt-zip-apk-pdf-to-be-sent-as-attachments-not-only-audio-video-media ). 👍 1

		As part of an intermediate threat level(?) model, I'd like to have - like in GO SMS Pro, for example - the passphrase-protection apply only to a subset of my contacts/conversations, which should not affect normal usage of the app for the rest of the conversations in any way. The &quot;sensitive&quot; conversations should only show up and be available to interact with when the passphrase is entered. For this to happen, of course, there needs to be an entirely different handling of the passphrase-protection (or just a new dedicated contacts-hiding passphrase mechanism?) where it doesn't auto-lock the whole app but only some conversations. In this case I should have something like an Unlock option in the Settings menu rather than as the first thing shown on app launch. The scenario I'm thinking of is probably a quite common one, where you expect to forget your phone on a table somewhere and to have people looking through it while you're gone. In that case it's not much of a problem if they can get past the lockscreen but it becomes more important that a few apps or app sections holding sensitive information be really locked down with something more complicated than what's typically available as a screen locker. (If I complicate the screen locker by making it a long PIN or passphrase I severely reduce the usability of my phone, and in my opinion it's the same with my SMS handling app, which should be able to deal with &quot;inocuous&quot; conversations quickly and easily even if I have other conversations that I want to keep under a tighter lock.) As for new message notifications from the hidden contacts, they should have some generic new-message text that doesn't disclose either the contact's name or the contents of what they've sent you. 👍 1 👎 5

		Bug description When a user changes key, the &quot;safety numbers changed, accept?&quot; message appears in a private conversation with the user, even if the message was sent in a group. I observed that people find this confusing, sometimes not realizing that they're missing group messages and then blaming Signal for losing them. I know that the fact that a message is a &quot;group message&quot; is itself part of the message, and if the message is not trusted this information shouldn't be trusted too. Still I think that in this case the sweet spot between security and usability lies in showing these messages in the group conversation. Partially related: #5985. Steps to reproduce Have a group conversation One of the users changes key (reinstalls Signal) Check where the &quot;safety numbers changed, accept?&quot; warning appears. Actual result: The warning appears in a private conversation with the user. Expected result: The warning appears in the group conversation.

		For the last month I couldn't use Signal. I was always getting that message saying that Signal couldn't delivery my message and no message was coming from friends. This started when I arrived Costa Rica for traveling. Yesterday I ran Signal over TOR and the problem was gone. But as soon as I leave the TOR network the messages stop leaving my phone. I have tried to uninstall and install Signal again but it says it can't reach the servers to register if I'm not on TOR...

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description These are small issues but I think they could have some impact on user experience. Here they are (in order of importance): There is too much empty space between messages from the same person. The amount of space is OK for messages from two different people but that space is too much for messages from the same person. I often express my point in several consecutive messages and the spaces are breaking the flow. Right now you could fit about two extra lines between the text of two consecutive messages. Similarly it's not necessary to display the profile picture for every message. In one-on-one chat you actually don't need the pictures at all. But I'm less sure if this is actually an issue. Actual result: a lot of space between messages which interrupts the flow of conversation Expected result: good use of space

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When listening to an audio or voice message ends, the screen turns on and the touchscreen accepts input, despite the phone still being next to the ear, after listening to an audio or voice message. This leads to unwanted calling and other actions, the user never intended to do. Steps to reproduce Start listening to an audio or voice message. Hold the phone next to the ear, so that the screen turns off and input from the touchscreen is ignored. Wait for the audio or voice message to end. Actual result: The screen turns back on and input from the touchscreen is no longer ignored. Expected result: The screen stays off and input is ignored, as long as the phone is next to the ear.

		Hi, Looking at the guidelines, I wasn't able to find how to request features and there are other ones here, so... Problem Devices with small storage and external SD cards have no possibility of using the external SD unless the phone is rooted (sometimes not even then). Solution Add option for user to select where the messages, etc. will be stored. Especially with the possibility to send media, this will come in handy to offload the main storage. As an added bonus, this is a feature WhatsApp doesn't have and seems to be reluctant to implement so that would be something they don't have. 👍 2

We need application which is acting like stock SMS app from the 1st view and without hiding this invitation tooltip we can't use the Signal. Our staff is texting to new recipients almost every time and we can't push our customers to do something.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I sent an encrypted message. I see two ticks indicating that it has been delivered. The recipient received the error &quot;Message encrypted for non-existing session&quot; The recipient couldn't send me a message saying there was an error, so tried resetting the secure connection. That didn't work. It turns out that the Sender has to reset the connection - but there's no indication in the UI that is what is needed. Steps to reproduce Send message Get notification of delivery - which is a lie Spouse gets annoyed Try to work out how Signal has broken itself Go through menu options, get frustrated Read online help, get more frustrated Switch to Telegram which seems to work just fine Actual result: Messages aren't delivered.

		I have: [ x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports When two people talk at the same time (or when talking overlaps eachother) android user's voice quality goes down and voice starts to become choppy. One must wait for another to finish talking otherwise they can't hear clearly. I've tried Pixel XL into iPhone 5S, Nexus 5X into iPhone 5S. HTC One M8 to Pixel XL. All same results. Only iPhone 6s to 5s works without problems. Using relayed calls from signal servers does not help. Only the device running android gets choppy, I can always hear the iPhone user fine. Both got choppy when called from android to android. Device info Device: Pixel XL Android version: 7.1.2 Signal version: 4.6.0, 4.6.1

		I respect that Signal is trying to improve the state of secure communications and is designed in such a way as to minimize the amount of metadata available to Open Whisper Systems, but because it is not a federated protocol, all Signal users must trust that Open Whisper Systems is telling the truth. While we have no reason to doubt that, it would be better not to have to operate solely on trust. There should be no downside to making Signal's servers world-readable (except for API keys, of course) so that users can verify for themselves that all messages are encrypted and minimal metadata are stored.

		What An option allowing the user to choose how messages should be sent. For encrypted chat all 3 options would be available. For unencrypted chat only SMS would be available. Why A person has ran out of data --&gt; SMS has ran out of free texts --&gt; data doesn't care --&gt; both wants more control has a good package and can use both at any time I haven't read up on the protocol, but I assume the encryption is end to end and since this once was called TextSecure, encrypted texts should still be possible.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Well the problem i have is some contacts hav tested Signal (on iOS) but have stoped useing the app. Signal stil expect them to use Signal. Since on my P9 I use Signal for all communiction SMS get to Signal conversation flow. If the contact that have passively abadoned signal write an SMS it gets listed and Signal defaults to send them an answer over data service, which the doesent reach the Phone of the SMS message received before. This is very bad. Moste of the time I am aware the person doesnt use Signal and chose SMS to sen dthe message but sometimes I forget it and the to be receiving person is going to be upset because she doesn't receive an answer. Steps to reproduce register mobile number A for signal delete app from phone of user A send an SMS from user A to B B uses Signal Android as SMS App B receives SMS message insecure B knows A has removed Signal from phone and wants to write back but forgets to choose SMS for sending the message A doesn't receive the message because it never contacts the server Actual result: contact doesn't receive an answer Expected result: Either the receiver should get the message over the way he sent it to the receiver or the sender should be made aware the receiver probably doesn't uses signal anymore or sms should be a default option to chose from in contact setting There are some workaround for this drop SMS on Android app altogether (which is a no brainier in myy eyes) make trafic type selection permanent, in user settings, which would just wire up some available functions as defaults (workaround) implement active database , eg a number doesn't communicate once in a (to be defined, weeks/months ) timeframe to the server (connect to server not sending receiving a message) either drop the number from Secure user circle or notify the sender of a data message the chat partner has seen no data usage recently and my not receive the message in time (optimal, but provides probably meta data leak) Device info Device: HUaweii P9 to iPhone 6 Android version: 7.0.0 Signal version: All until to date as of writing 👍 3

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I installed a different ROM for my phone and made a backup of my conversations. After installing the ROM I registered my device and tried to restore the backup. That seemed to work fine but on closer inspection it turned out that group chats had been split into separate conversations, one for each person in the chat. So, for example, if I was in a group chat with Tom and Jerry, I would now have one chat with Tom (with all messages he sent to the group) and one for Jerry (with his messages). The group chat was not restored at all. Steps to reproduce Use Signal like normal (I did use a custom build with layout changes I've been working on with my own signing key, version 4.6.0), participate in group chats Create a backup in Signal Install a custom ROM (Lineage OS in my case). I wiped everything like system, cache, etc, except the internal storage (data) partition. Reinstall Signal Import the backup you've created earlier Actual result: Group chats are imported as separate chats for each person participating in the chat. Expected result: Group chats should be restored the way I backed them up, so all the messages from that group should appear in that group chat. Screenshots Omitted because privacy and I don't have photoshop at hand to do some blurring. Device info Device: Moto X 2014 (victara) xt1092 Android version: 6.0.0 (stock moto) -&gt; 7.1.2 lineage os nightly june 2nd Signal version: 4.6.0 / 4.6.1 Link to debug log Sorry, don't have that.. 👍 2

It's not immediately obvious where to find it. A better setup would be to host an F-Droid repo so you could push prompt, secure updates to your users using an alternative download channel. Thanks :) 👍 2

		Quite often when &quot;sharing&quot; a clipboard (text) with the Signal App I noticed that the text is inappropriate or more simply, I decided not to send this text. I have to mark and delete the text. It would be easier, if the text input has a button(marked with &quot;X&quot; or a delete symbol), so that the text could be quickly deleted by clicking the button or symbol.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When using the desktop app, when a person sends me a message, the chat window jumps to a section of disappearing messages from a week ago. The disappearing timer was set to five minutes. The messages disappeared from my phone correctly, but they are still visible on my computer. The messages have also disappeared on the phone and computer of the account that they were sent to. Steps to reproduce Unfortunately, I have never seen this before, so I am not exactly sure of the steps to reproduce it. Here are the repro steps from my end that made this happen: Send messages from Android (OnePlus 3T phone, Signal v 4.6.1) Messages were received on Android (Google Nexus 5 phone) Use Signal Desktop a week later on a Mac (macOS Sierra 10.12.5, Chrome 58.0.3029.110) Actual result: Messages that were supposed to disappear are still visible Expected result: Secure messages should disappear from all devices Screenshots In the screenshot you can see the text about turning on and off disappearing messages but also the timestamp showing that the messages occurred last Monday: Device info Computer: Device: Macbook Pro, macOS Sierra 10.12.5, Chrome 58.0.3029.110 Android version: 7.1.1 Signal version: 4.6.1 Link to debug log The desktop app doesn't seem to provide debug logs. I can provide one from my phone, if that will be useful, but the bug doesn't appear on my phone. 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Testing current master @ 59d3e66. Got a message from a contact who has new safety numbers. Replying on my phone fails and offers unsecured fallback (&quot;This message will not be encrypted because the recipient is no longer a Signal user&quot;). The input text field still says &quot;Signal message&quot; and the contact still appears in the list of Signal contacts, even after a contact list refresh. Sending messages from Desktop to this contact works fine. Steps to reproduce receive a Signal msg from someone with new safety numbers try to reply -&gt; unsecured fallback refresh contacts, try to reply -&gt; same reply from desktop (works), try to reply from Signal-Android again -&gt; still getting unsecured fallback prompt Device info Device: FP1 Android version: 4.2.2 Signal version: master at 59d3e66 (edit: still happening at 52311eb) Link to debug log I think there's an unrelated crash in this log, I'll probably have to open another issue for that one. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/90fbff8812f10e19f659ad12cf588a3b

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Actual result: After having created a new group with three contacts, when adding further new contacts, only a fraction of signal-enabled contacts are shown and selectable Steps to reproduce Provisionally, I stopped and restarted Signal ; and generated new index of contacts (Android Contact app) the bug is still present Expected result: I expected the whole contact list of my Signal contacts. I compared the list (while adding contacts to an existing group) with the list when using to send a Signal message. My observation is: List (when adding contacts to a group): A B ... Z List (when sending to someone) A AnameWithA B BnameWithB ... (more entries) Z (until here, same as above) # (space) +telephonenumber (space) +telephonenumber 1 1and1 A B .. Z The second part appears to be the correct full list of contacts. Bug The selection - when selecting contacts to be added to a group - appears to show only the first part (&quot;A&quot;....&quot;Z&quot;) of the list. Screenshots n/a Device info Device: Huawei P8 Lite Android version: 6.0 Signal version: 4.6.1 Link to debug log n/a

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description A contact of mine unregistered recently. I decided to check and see if Signal would now default to sending that contact SMS. Upon opening the contact's conversation view, the application crashed. While reproducing the issue to produce a log, it seems it has worsened, and now Signal crashes on launch, rendering it completely unusable. I think this is caused by having an existing encrypted conversation with the contact. Looking at the logs, it appears that the identity information is deleted after the user unregisters, but it still tries to access the identity information to decrypt the existing messages. I haven't looked at the relevant code yet, so this is just a guess. Steps to reproduce contact unregisters from Signal go to their conversation view app crashes Actual result: Signal crashes. Expected result: Signal should not crash. Device info Device: Huwai Nexus 6P Android version: 7.1.2 Signal version: latest master Link to debug log I can't open Signal to capture a log without it crashing, but here's a snippet from logcat: https://paste.ee/p/1iAC5

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Marking a contact as verified or unverified generates a status message in each conversation the contact is in. But both actions are manually and deliberately carried out by the user, so I think that one status message in the one-to-one conversation is enough. Steps to reproduce choose a contact that is member of several groups mark that contact as verified check the conversation list Actual result: All conversations that the contact is in have a new status message and thus jump to the top of the conversation list, however old the group conversation may have been Expected result: Only show a status message in the one-to-one conversation Maybe it would still be somewhat helpful to generate a status message in a group once all group members have been verified.

		As I didn't understand what the &quot;Safety numbers approval&quot; switch really does, and the blog post does not mention it, I tried to look it up in the source code. It seems to me that isSendingIdentityApprovalRequired() is not called anywhere. I guess that the idea is: when the switch is turned on, then approval is always required when sending, without taking into account if the sender had the opportunity to see the safety number change warning. The receiving behavior doesn't change. This is not clear from the interface, a better description of the switch could be something like: &quot;Require approval of safety numbers changes for unverified contacts&quot; Device info Signal version: 4.7.0

		So here is the idea: now that we have persistent identity verification, an SMS based safety number verification can be implemented. Of course this is not as good as a face-to-face meeting where the numbers are checked, but the only way to perform a MITM is to control both the Signal server and the mobile carrier, in order to manipulate the SMS message exchange. This is very unlikely (remember that the SSL certificate of the server is pinned). I think that an attack of this kind is less likely than getting the device compromised. In this case encryption is not of any help.

		Backgrund: PR #6731. This could be automated like this: The QR code contains the safety number and a random password, valid only while the QR code page is open; Device A scans Device B's QR code, checks the number, marks it as &quot;verified&quot; and sends an acknowledgement message to device B, authenticated by the temporary password; If the password matches, device B sets the number as verified too, as the acknowledgement message can only come from a device that physically scanned the QR code. #1016 deserves some love too. Thanks @moxie0 for the great features 4.7.0 brought. Edit: thinking about it, the &quot;temporary password&quot; probably doesn't need to be temporary at all, just random and per-contact. 👍 1

		Can you please implement Phonegap Build (github.com/phonegap-build) to handle updates. Another git hub project called DuckieTV uses it with their android app, and it has made the update process completely stream line. For example, upon opening the app Phonegap Build automatically checks for updates, and if found then asks whether to ignore or update and restart, after this there is no additional action required by the user.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Repro: On Signal Desktop, open a chat without disappearing messages set Click the 3 dots button and click &quot;Disappearing messages&quot; This sets the timer to 1 day. This is a problem because if I want 1 week I now have accidentally deleted 6 days of messages (I presume). Even if that is not the case it looks like it might be. It's confusing and suggests possible data loss. Not sure what the best solution is. As a user I'd be happy if clicking the menu item merely made the disappearing messages button visible but set to off. I can then directly set the desired choice.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports When the message is sent, the first tick acknowledges that the message was sent correctly and if there is an error, the notification alerting the user appears after some time. The second tick acknowledges the correct reception of the message and it would be great to have an option to notify the user if message is not received even after some time (a few days for example). It usually indicates dead phone or battery, that the recepient is no longer available on Signal, wrong recepient, or even some exotic bug in the system, etc. Therefore it would be very practical to have a notification popping up alerting the user that message hasn't been received even after some time. I also suggest this time be adjustable and 1 day as the default setting.

See the picture. Steps to reproduce Honestly I wish I knew. I've had my phone for about 7 months now (Since last Christmas) and I've been using the same install of Signal all this time.

		When a contact doesn't use signal anymore, we should have the option to move back to sms. Not having a read receipt for a month is a good indication... but settings would also work in the conversation. I get that we don't really want to fix issues like this, but it's kind of a non-starter if you still haven't fixed the problem in a rational way. #6377 This isn't an error with the software, it's a design error. The logs are in the issue tracker 😃

		Steps to reproduce Have a member of a group unsubscribe from Signal Check how the now unsubscribed number is still part of the group Now the stale number is impossible to remove from the group. Sometimes re-registering is not an option, as access to the number might have been lost. Most of the time the user just doesn't care. Expected result: The unsubscribed user is automatically removed from all the groups. I know the server is not aware of groups, but I think there are still ways to handle this. For example: When sending a message to a group (i.e., to all the group members), if a user is not a Signal user anymore, remove it; Before adding a user to a group because of a message coming from another group member, check if the number is actually a Signal number. Signal version: 4.8.0

		searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports I installed the Signal apk, from the WhisperSystems website (Signal 4.7.4), on Android-X86 in a virtual machine and linked it with the Chromium app, so far so good. Even so the linking process worked pretty fine, it turned out that all the other functionality in Signal-on-Android-x86 isn't working at all (like sending text messages or esp. calling other signal users). That is probably because Android-x86 (in a Virtualbox) uses the LAN interface (NIC) (to connect to the internet) and it seems like the Signal-Android-app expects a WiFi connection instead of a LAN connection. Could you please try to find a solution, so that people could use the Signal-Android-App on Android-x86 to call their contacts (of course a solution for the Signal-Chromium-Desktop-App would be preferable ;) )?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description The current isLowMemory code suboptimally uses getMemoryClass instead of getLargeMemoryClass. Since Signal already sets android:largeHeap, the relevant limit is returned by getLargeMemoryClass, as per the Android documentation. I think this is behind the effect where some devices can easily send higher resolution images over other messaging apps (e.g. Whatsapp) but get a rather low memory class rating in Signal and compress the images too much as a result.

		I updated from 4.8.1 to 4.9.4. I had an old sms with sender &quot;4Launch&quot; (a webshop) in the conversation list. After the conversion it shows just &quot;4&quot; in the sender field, which I don't think it should do. Edit: it also has the value 4 in the address field in table sms. When I change it to 4Launch, FC Signal and reopen it it still shows 4 as sender.

		#I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Would love the ability to search for strings/text within a conversation/thread. Currently, can only search for contact names on the main Signal screen when you first open the app/after login which shows the list of conversations. Would love either a global in-thread search so I can search for all instances of a string or word (and perhaps other search operators that can search for the existence of &quot;attachments&quot; or even date-ranges?) across all the saved conversations on the phone, or at minimum a search function within a single thread.

		Hi, I'm using Signal Desktop on macOS Sierra. Whenever I exit Signal and Chrome is still running, Signal actually doesn't exit. Which I find rather annoying. When someone sends messages, I always get notified. I don't understand why the app doesn't actually shut down. It really annoying and I think it's a matter of security, in my opinion, if I think if direct physical access/people peeking over your shoulder. No that I think about it, runs nontheless whenever I simply start Chrome. So I can't use Chrome without actually using Signal.

		Bug description While registered with Signal on a foreign number, and visiting UAE, Signal does not work so whilst de-registration of foreign number, messages that were not being sent/received are suddenly sent/received in that time window. Is there a possible vulnerability just during that time frame? Steps to reproduce Use a SIM card from a foreign country where Signal is not blocked or censored and register and use it in that country. Go to UAE and use Signal (messages will not be sent) Send a few messages and instantly go to next step Try de-registering (it will give an error of &quot;error connecting to server&quot;) Previously sent messages will be delivered whilst the de-registration is happening Messages will not be sent anymore afterwards and de-registration won't happen. Messages sent from outside UAE are also not delivered normally, but are received whilst the UAE user is de-registering. Actual result: So messages are not being sent/received at all.... but then when trying to de-register the messages are sent/received. The main problem here is that during de-registration all messages are sent/received. Expected result: Not sure what I expect, but if Signal is blocked then messages shouldn't go through at all. So maybe it is a security issue, or perhaps there is another way to circumvent censorship? Screenshots Sorry no screenshots as the explanation is self-sufficient (hopefully). Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy S7 Android version: 7.0 Signal version: 4.8.1 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/b53230b3764cb08ad97ff102088700db

		I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates Bug description Scenario: Someone is using Signal, then switches to a new phone but doesn’t reinstall/re-set up Signal. Issue: I send them a text message through Signal. The lock symbol appears (so the message is being routed through Signal), the first checkmark (the message was sent) appears, but I never get the second checkmark (the message was delivered). I've run into this issue with at least 3 people in the last week. In addition to the problem itself, it is additionally problematic that there is no notification the message was never delivered. I only discover it when I go to text that person again days, or weeks later - and even then it often takes me a few more instances before I notice what's going on. Steps to reproduce Set up Signal on a phone. Drop phone in toilet. Get a new phone, don't set up Signal. Have someone else send you a text message. Actual result: The recipient does not receive any message. The sender does not receive a notification their message failed to deliver. Expected result: Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) The text message would be routed to the recipient's normal text message app, OR... The sender would be notified the text message could not be delivered. Platform info Operating System: LG G6, Android 7.0. Signal version: 4.9.9

Even deleting the draft doesn't delete the file. Actual result: A file with a jpg extension is created in the folder /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.thoughcrime.securesms/files - the file name is made of the digits of what appears to be ctime of the time the file was created. The file persists throughout the life of the app and never deleted, even when the image in the conversation is deleted or the entire conversation is deleted. Clearing Signal's storage from the app info applet does delete all files in that folder. Expected result: Ideally, No plaintext image file would be created anywhere within the phone's file system Alternatively, the file will be deleted as soon as practicable after it has been encrypted and stored in Signal's database Device info Device: Tested on OnePlus 2 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Android version: Tested under OxygenOS Stock 3.6.0 for Oneplus 2 and Cyanogen 14.1 NIGHTLY for S7 Signal version: 4.9.9 and, based on the pictures left on my device, multiple previous versions 👍 7

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Messages sent from signal don't come through to SMS on new phone without signal. The new phone shares the number of an old phone that had signal. My guess is that the number is still registered in the server since signal was never uninstalled from the old phone, so the server tries to route to the app for that number, even though the new phone doesn't have it. Installing signal on the new phone makes new messages come through without trouble. Steps to reproduce buy new phone with new sim card transfer number to new phone don't uninstall signal from old phone don't install signal on new phone Actual result: new phone doesn't get messages sent from signal Expected result: new phone should get messages from signal in default SMS app Device info Device: iPhone 6s (new phone), Galaxy S6 (old phone)

Reason: If one has the need for using disappearing messages it seems very likely this person does not want anyone to know that there was any exchange of communication at the time. Actual result: If I switch between different timer settings, all of them get listed in the conversation. So if anyone is eavesdropping on my conversation, it might be suspicious to see that information and that could lead to questioning. Expected result: After a 'hidden' conversation disappered, the info about it should disappear as well. Device info All devices, all Signal versions up till now. 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description A contact that used to have Signal and no longer does will no longer let me switch from encrypted to unencrypted message Steps to reproduce Have a message open with a contact that used to have signal but no longer does Hold down the send button to switch from encrypted message to unencrypted message Actual result: It quickly selects the grey send button and switches back to the blue (encrypted) send button. Expected result: In the past it always just selected the grey send button and let me send the message unencrypted Screenshots Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 4.10.3 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/a6e6e652217b3e306d9b26e3749b8e53 Additional Note This would ultimately be solved if there was a way to unlink a contact who had signal and was sync'd but no longer uses it. Currently when a user stops using signal, I can't tell unless I send a message and notice there is only 1 checkmark instead of 2. This has been a bug since I started using Signal years ago though.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When I click on link &quot;Learn more&quot; in &quot;Verify safety number&quot; I see address whispersystems.org redirects to signal.org and reports 404. It looks like http server redirect for this particular link is not working properly. Steps to reproduce Start Signal. From main Signal window click on pencil button. List of contacts is displayed. Click on one of Signal user. From top-right menu select &quot;Conversation settings&quot;. Select &quot;View safety number&quot;. At the bottom tab on link &quot;Learn more&quot;. Actual result: Now problem appears. In address bar there is https://whispersystems.org/redirect/safety-numbers that redirects to https://signal.org/redirect/safety-numbers but this page displays &quot;404&quot; with text &quot;Something is amiss! You might try browsing for what you wanted.&quot; Clicking on link &quot;browsing for what you wanted&quot; displays https://moxie.org web page. Expected result: Instead o 404 actual help should be displayed. My humble suggestion: Quick fix: fix the http server redirect (this will fix help links in currently installed Signal versions) Long term fix: replace all of the whispersystems.org links to signal.org in Signal app (the same in iOS and desktop version) to remove chance of redirect problems.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Today I was trying to send a regular SMS message via signal app. It was not successful (maybe because the signal of the network was weak and sometimes disappeared), and all the sudden Signal started to repeatedly send the message in a crazy speed. My phone asked if I still want to allow that, but even when pressing deny the question came back. As this rendered my phone useless, I made a restart. The problem came back after the restart. I switched back to the default SMS app, and this has not happened since. (The problem never appeared either before.) Steps to reproduce I have no clue. Never happened before and since. See my description for details.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When using a dual SIM Android phone, un-encrypted text messages (SMS) are sent from the primary SIM card even when all received text messages from this contact were received by the secondary SIM. Steps to reproduce SIM1 is the primary SIM with the data connection. SIM2 is the secondary SIM without data connection. In my case, Signal was registered using the number of SIM2. However, sending/receiving encrypted messages via SIM1 only works flawlessly, thanks! open existing conversation of a contact which does not use Signal (yet) this contact does only know my SIM2 number and thus, the whole conversation so far was written to and sent by my SIM2 send an un-encrypted text message without manually switching the send-button to SIM2; SIM1 is always selected and used by default Actual result: the contact gets my message from my SIM1 phone number which she did not recognize my text message gets misinterpreted as spam which results in a failed conversation Expected result: my text message gets sent via SIM2 (as before) and my contact recognizes my number IMHO, this can be accomplished in two ways: Signal asks me once (per un-encrypted conversation) which SIM I want to use for this contact This can be modified in the conversation settings Signal analyses the conversation so far and if (a) every or (b) the most recent ones or (c) the previous message was sent from SIM2, use SIM2 as long as I manually don't switch the SIM for this conversation. I'd go with 2. (c) because it seems to be the most intuitive solution without additional UI elements for switching default SIM in the conversation settings.

			<description>
		On other messaging apps, the typical behavior within a conversation that includes multiple media files such as images, is to allow swiping left/right to the previous/next one. If multiple images are shared in a conversation, that makes it much easier to go through them all without leaving fullscreen. In Signal if, let's say, 5 images are shared in a row, you need to open them individually, then go back, open the next one and repeat until done.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description After the recent update signal asks if I would like to &quot;make my profile name and photo visible to this group&quot; in group chat windows but there is no way to dismiss the message without actually sharing my details. Tapping on the message brings up a prompt with two options: CANCEL MAKE VISIBLE Tapping cancel does not make the prompt at the top of the chat go away and I do not wish to share my details in the chat. Steps to reproduce Update to the latest version of Signal Open group chat, you should see a blue prompt at the top of the chat Tap on the prompt Tap on &quot;CANCEL&quot; Actual result: The popup disappears but leaves the prompt at the top of the screen. Expected result: The prompt should be dismissed after tapping cancel. Device info Device: Nexus 6 Android version: 7.1.1 Signal version: 4.10.11 👍 4

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I enabled the option &quot;Show name only&quot; in &quot;Notifications&quot;. When I receive a message, the text &quot;New message&quot; is shown in my notifications (which is intended), but when I want to reply directly in the notification, it should show the message that I received (but still shows the &quot;New message&quot; text). How can I answer if I don't know what the message was. This worked on my old phone with Android 4.2.2, but does not with my new one with Android 7. Steps to reproduce In options: Notifications &gt; Show &gt; Name only Close Signal Receive new message Try to reply directly from your notifications Actual result: When I use direct reply within the notifications, &quot;New message&quot; is shown Expected result: When I hit direct reply within the notifications, the message text should be shown Screenshots Device info Device: OnePlus 5 Android version: 7.1.1 Signal version: 4.10.12

		I can't emphasize enough how much I don't want to see peoples profile pictures, or read their names on every single message they send (!?). Is there an option to just have their names be their first initial and not show them on the message? Is there an option to just have their names be their first initial and not show them on the message? Could such a thing be added? 👍 2

		I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Once in awhile, I am in a conversation with a signal user and for about 10-15 seconds, the blue circle with airplane changes to gray and the text changes to &quot;send unsecure sms message&quot;. I don't really have particular steps to repro this with, but it seems to happen if I'm chatting with a signal user and during that, another contact I've invited to use signal installs it and messages me. Steps to reproduce see above Actual result: Signal contacts appearing as non-signal contacts sometimes in-conversation with them Expected result: Signal contacts always show as signal contacts in-conversation unless they've uninstalled the app, etc. Screenshots Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy S8 Android version: 7.0 Signal version: 4.10.12 Link to debug log 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Describe here the issue that you are experiencing. My old phone broke, and I got lent one by a friend, Samsung S3 (model GT-I9300), running CyanogenMod (11.0-InstallerXNPQ32P) with android 4.4.4 which is old but they asked me not to reflash it as it had some tools that were hard to set up and worked which they didn't want breaking. The google play framework was out of date, so couldn't install via the play store, instead getting the apk from https://signal.org/android/apk/ and installing it. I have swapped sims from old phone, and started up signal, registered and sent test message to my friend which worked, they could send one back and that worked. Later I asked someone from a group chat I was in to send a message to the group, and it came through, but now everytime I open the app it crashes with the stack trace shown below. I get notifications fine, but whenever I go into the app it crashes. I cleared data and reinstalled the apk and it still does this repeatably. It also has xposed framework on it, but I couldn't see how to disable that so unsure if it is interfering. I'm just wondering whether this would be an issue with: signal old cyanogen old gapps xposed Attached the logs below, let me know if you need more than that. Steps to reproduce Have a group chat on one phone Register a new device running outdated software? Receive a group chat message Actual result: Crash Expected result: Signal works as normal, can view group chat messages, no crash.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description In most of the groups all members are in my contacts already (e.g. close friends). I am never asked to make my profile visible to any of those users individually, because they are in my contacts. But now in those groups I am asked to do this explicitly. It would be nice if I would not see this banner as long as there are only contacts in this group. Steps to reproduce someone else creates a group where all members are already in your contacts Actual result: Banner requests to make profile visible. Expected result: I already made my profile visible to all group members individually (e.g. automatically), so the banner should not be there. P.S.: The &quot;contact verified&quot; flag could also be used to decide that a profile should be made visible automatically. Device info Signal version: 4.11.0 👍 3

		This is an usability issue: the read receipts feature is not clear. What should I expect? A triple tick mark then the recipient read the message? A change in color in the tick marks? Or will the second tick mark appear only if the message has been read (so if I disable read receipts, I won't know if a message has been delivered)? How can I tell if a contact disabled the read receipts, or if s/he actually didn't read my messages?

Only a part of the screen is scrolled. the profile picture does not fade out and the &quot;shared media&quot; image rail gets hidden behind the profile picture. when starting to scroll from within &quot;chat settings&quot; the whole screen is scrolled and the profile picture fades away as expected. ---&gt; expected behaviour: that scrolling behaves consistent. when starting to scroll within the &quot;shared media&quot; image rail the whole screen should be scrolled and the profile picture should fade away. group conversation: go into a group conversation with shared media try to scroll within the &quot;shared media&quot; image rail - it does not work / scroll. try to scroll from the &quot;chat settings&quot; field scrolling works. ---&gt; expected behaviour: scrolling is also possible when starting to scroll within the &quot;shared media&quot; image rail Device info Device: Fairphone 2 Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 4.11.1 👍 1

		This is not an issue but could not find the best place to post this. Are there any plans to implement a feature like the Facebook Messenger where the conversations are easily accessible from any screen? I find it really useful to be able to have the bubbles on the side while I have another app open without the need to constantly switch between them to keep the conversation going.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Not really sure how to report this. I deem that it belongs here since it is not a support request, and is an issue with Signal. But it it is considerably more general than other bug reports. I have read all of the issue tickets reporting issues with the new profile feature, and all of them identify issues with the way the feature was implemented. None of them speak to the addition of this feature itself as problematic. I use Signal because it is still the project with the most diligent commitment to smartphone messaging privacy. I have until now had high confidence that Signal development decisions would be smart and levelheaded, and would not compromise my privacy. The addition of the profile feature has shaken that confidence. The announcement of the Profile feature in Beta, which I've only now had a chance to read, claims &quot;All of this is possible without sacrificing the privacy and security that you have come to expect from Signal.&quot; This is not true. Half of my contacts know me by one name, half by another. It is imperative that there is no crossover between these identities. Furthermore, the gmail account my Android phone is registered under is a third identity. Disclosing that identity to some Signal contacts would represent a catastrophic privacy breach, which could even, hypothetically, endanger my life. Up until now, there has been no cause for concern in using Signal, as enforcing the segregation of these identities has presented no issues. Signal's design decisions have never presented any threat to this segregation, because the presumption has always been in favour of privacy. The &quot;set up your profile&quot; wizard which announced itself after the update prepopulated the name field with the name associated with my Google account. It would have been very easy to have accidentally accepted this as my profile name. As per the Signal blogpost, this name would then have been visible to all contacts saved in my phone. This decision thoughtlessly left me a single mistake away from a catastrophic privacy breach. The &quot;Do It Later&quot; option was minuscule and dangerously close in the UI to the very large &quot;Accept&quot; button. It was initially not visible to me, so it looked as if I was being forced to choose a unitary identity for a Signal instance where I was managing multiple identities. When I did spot it, after a reinstall, several attempts to press it on my large smartphone screen were unsuccessful. It took multiple attempts. Before I discovered the &quot;Do it later&quot; option, my compromise attempt to save an empty profile returned an error message. I also discovered, after temporarily choosing a privacy-preserving pseudonymous profile name (which would nevertheless appear highly incongruous to several of my contacts) that it is not possible to delete an identity once chosen. There is no option to do so, and if you try to save an empty profile it gives you an error. So I had to reinstall the app to delete my profile. And when you do not set up a profile, the app harrasses you with persistent notifications to do so during group conversations, as if the decision not to is assumed to be a temporary one by the Signal devs. There are several bug reports which suggests mitigations for some of these different problems (although not all of them - e.g. I have seen no mention of the prepopulation of the name field as a concern). Fixing each of these problems would indeed have reduced the severity of the threat to privacy represented by the introduction of the feature. (I also imagine there are people who believe that simply adding support for multiple profiles would solve the issue, but in my opinion this would drastically sophisticate the task of managing identities, and result in accidental breaches.) But fixing each of those issues would not address what seems to me the major issue: that this issue was so thoughtlessly introduced at all. Yes, it is clear that - to preserve my privacy - Signal devs decided it would be unwise to just automatically create a profile for me based on the name associated with my Gmail account. Instead I was given a dialogue with the name prepopulated. But this in itself was dangerous, and the fact that I was subjected to even this danger with apparently no consideration of how it could affect people with multiple identities leaves me with little confidence that similar or worse breaches might be thoughtlessly created in the future, in order to introduce some convenience feature which is secondary to the goal of a truly private messaging application. Using Signal is now fraught with inherent risk, and I am no longer confident that Signal devs have my privacy as their priority. For me - a Signal user whose privacy is paramount - this profile feature is not a feature but a bug. The utility added to the app by the profile feature, eliminating unknown phone numbers in group conversations, seems to address an edge case at best. It does not enhance the privacy of the user - its only effect on user privacy is to make privacy compromise more likely. I cannot see how its addition necessitates the attendant complexification of the task of staying private while using the app. And the reasoning behind its introduction, in a dev team with a commitment to privacy, is entirely opaque to me. I submit this issue as a Signal user who values privacy, and who has experienced a privacy scare because of Signal development decisions - something which I am sure should be of concern to a privacy-oriented project. It is considerably longer than a typical bug report, because it speaks to a broader issue. If this issue can be taken on and used to improve matters, that is to the good. If it is simply the case that Signal is reprioritising, or that it does not intend to cater to users like me with harder privacy requirements than the average (but privacy-conscious) user, that is sad to me, but I accept it. But it also suggests to me that it is misleading to call it Signal Private Messenger, and to entice users with more stringent needs into a potentially risky situation. 👍 1 👎 1

		I mainly use signal for anonymous faceless communication with people I don't know or want to know. I don't want to see the picture the chose for themselves when I add them to my contacts. A bubble with a letter and color will do just fine. Please add an option to fully disable contact avatars from the app and stop downloading them from the servers. Thanks. 👍 1

		When forwarding a message to another contract, the contract choser shows a &quot;-1&quot; at the bottom of the contract list, even though I have no such telephone number saved in my contracts. When clicking on that entry and thus forwarding a message to that contact, sending fails. Also, the next time trying to forward a message, the &quot;-1&quot; is present twice in the list, once because it is now part of the chat list (due to that unsent forwarded message), and once again at the very bottom of the list.

		Not really a bug, and sorry if this is already a thing somewhere in the issues, but right now, if someone had Signal on an iphone, and got rid of it, the android app doesn't pick up on it automatically, and you have to manually send them &quot;insecure&quot; texts by holding down the send button first. A way to just select unsecure as a default, or perhaps a conversation setting that tells signal to just send regular old messages until changed in the future, would be great. Thanks.

		How do you possibly think that this is acceptable behavior? I had no chance to stop it or opt out. I don't want to use Signal for everything. I don't want some of my contacts to know I am using Signal. Even though they are unencrypted, I prefer email, SMS, and POTS calls over your proprietary walled garden. Stop. Please. You can't stoop to this level, even if everyone else is doing so.

		The blue read receipts checkmarks clash with the dark theme. You have gray, gray, gray then blue. Gray and blue just don't match. I suggest red instead, everyone knows red and gray/dark/black match. If you chose blue to match the color of signal, I understand, but then... it just doesn't work, it stands out with all the gray and feels weird. Can the color change with the theme? Does anyone agree with me? To reduce comments, use the thumbs up to agree! 👍 2

		This discussion really applies to the entire Signal stack, but it had to put someplace. Also, I'm not entirely sure signal doesn't already have something like this. Signal does a great job at client e2e encryption. People mostly seem excited about it's ability to prevent people from listening in on conversations. Aside from encryption GPG also gives us verification that the message originated from a specific individual. I'm curious, what is that verification was taken one step further? What if a blockchain (of sorts) was kept for each conversation? This way, we enforce the order in which messages were sent and most importantly that message b came directly after message a. Deletion or insertion of messages after the fact would not be possible. Such an implementation would ensure a conversation remains the same between all parties involved and that no individual could inject or remove parts of conversations without the other parties involved noticing. An example of something like this is how git handles commits. Each commit contains a hash of the current commit (and diff) and the hash of the previous commit. A simple program can then run against the commits to verify the repo is in good order. In Signal's case, a central authority would be necessary. So the hash chain would probably need to exist on the server. The clients can sync against the hash chain and verify their local conversations match the server's. Thoughts?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I updated some apps from the Play Store yesterday, shortly after the Signal update started, the Cyanogenmod boot animation was displayed (notification bar and on-screen buttons on top, but unresponsive). I waited a few minutes until I hard rebooted the phone. After booting, the regular &quot;Enter PIN&quot; screen + background was displayed shortly, then again the background changed to the boot animation and the device became unresponsive to touchscreen input. A few seconds later the background changed to black. I rebooted several times, wiped cache and Dalvik cache from CWM, but to no avail. I finally did a factory reset, after which the phone worked normally again. Assuming the issue wasn't due to this specific update, I later reinstalled Signal from the Play Store, which resulted in a broken system all over again. Steps to reproduce Update or install current Signal version (on CM11) Actual result: Boot animation is displayed and system becomes unresponsive Expected result: Signal is updated/installed Device info Device: Sony Xperia Z1 Compact Android version: 4.4.4 (CM 11-20141112-SNAPSHOT-M12-amami) Signal version: 4.11.5 Link to debug log NA

		If you use Signal for Android as an SMS client, you have to look at your phone to read the SMS, even if you have a Signal Desktop paired with the Android. It'd be great if there was a way to configure Signal for Android to automatically proxy SMS messages to/from Signal Desktop. I'm told iMessages does this as well.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When Signal is used as an SMS client, it is frustrating for the user and the recipient of messages in which the recipient has Signal installed but is still using SMS. Many of my contacts have signal installed but still use SMS separately, or use iPhones where they cannot use signal for SMS. When a Signal contact sends me an SMS message, the Signal default is to respond via a Signal message, which is confusing for the other party and inconvenient for the user, who has to remember to change the mode to SMS. This discourages users from using Signal as their SMS client. Steps to reproduce Receive an SMS from a phone number registered with Signal. Actual result: The user responds with a Signal message, which may appear differently on the recipient's device and cause confusion. Expected result: The Signal app should either match the sender's mode of communication (perhaps with a warning about encryption) OR remember the user's preference for that contact across restarts of the app. Screenshots Friend sends an SMS. I reply in Signal without realizing, then re-reply via SMS. Friend sends an SMS. I remember to change the send-mode to SMS, but after an app restart the app is back to the default of sending Signal messages.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description The decline button is overlapping the accept button for incoming calls. Not impossible but very challenging to swipe up. (see Screenshot) Steps to reproduce Best thing for me to reproduce is to restart my phone. At first I thought this would only occur when the incoming call is the first after a fresh start. But that didn't turn out to be true. All I can say for now is sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. Actual result: Decline button is in front of the accept button which makes it nearly impossible to answer calls.

		Currently the colors used to distinguish delivered from read messages are so similar, that it's rather hard to distinguish. Also blue is not the best color for color blind people. Ideally I guess the icon itself should change a little, at least use another color. For me personnaly a more prominent blue would solve the issue. Currently mobile so please excuse me if it has been filed before...

		Pretty sure this is a dupe but I'm too tired to share and to annoyed that it's now difficult to share to my Bitmoji only group chat. With a recent update (4.13.6), there's now a new list of conversations that shows up when you're sharing content from another app. With the old behavior you got a list of conversations in order of last received/sent. In the new version you first get your to five last received/sent conversations, then a list of all your contacts. If you would like to share this content with a group that isn't in your top 5, it will now show up in that following contacts list. You'll have to go and send a message to the group separately so that it then shows up in that list. Again I'm half asleep and slightly intoxicated. My apologies if this is a duplicate.

		It'd be great if Signal had less G$$gle dependencies, so after the GCM-free version, location sharing without G$$gle Maps would be great. There is a small messenger out there named Kontalk which implemented this feature some time ago, maybe you can take some code from their GitHub to make it less effort: https://github.com/kontalk/androidclient 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When I open some old 1:1 conversations from the conversation list I get the message &quot;The sender is not in your contact list&quot;. These persons are in my contact list though and if I check my contact list, Signal is listed in the &quot;connected via&quot; list. Also some of them are part of Signal groups that I do use regularly. It can easily be resolved by choosing the &quot;Add to contacts&quot; option and then directly go back to Signal, without actually adding the contact so it's not a major issue however it's a bit confusing. Attached a logfile from the moment I opened a conversation and got the &quot;Sender not in contact list&quot; message. Just to specify 'old' :-) Conversations older then September show this behavior. Steps to reproduce Open old conversation Actual result: Some contacts are reported not to be in the contact list when they actually are. Expected result: Don't get &quot;sender not in contact list&quot; message for contacts that are in the contact list.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When I try to send an sms with the sms permissions disabled, Signal crashes. I'm not having sms enabled in Signal however by long pressing the paperclip icon in a conversation I can send an sms. Since 4.14 would support permissions I thought, let's disable the sms permissions for Signal and send an sms by long pressing the paperclip. As a result I got the message &quot;Signal stopped&quot; and it cannot be started again. I first had to enable the sms permissions before I was able to start Signal again. Steps to reproduce Disable sms permissions for Signal In a conversation long press the paperclip so you can send an unsecured sms Send unsecured sms message Actual result: Signal crashes Expected result: After selecting unsecured sms in a conversation I would expect Signal to request the sms permission and after excepting it I would be able to send an sms or if I denied it sms would not be possible.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Android app is unable to send messages, open the &quot;link devices&quot; option in settings, or even deregister. Messages are received upon a reboot. Chrome app on desktop continues to work fine. Steps I took Earlier today, everything was fine, and I was chatting away happily via my Android device. I then chatted a bit via the app on my desktop. Walked away from my computer and opened up the Android app again and tried to send a message, but it failed. Attempted to retry, and it failed again. Went back to my computer, and sent a message via the desktop. It was received fine. Got a reply as well. Everything seemed fine from the desktop perspective, but none of the messages were received on my phone. Attempted to open the &quot;linked devices&quot; list and I get a &quot;Network connection failed&quot; error dialog. Attempted to deregister the device, as per https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/216948747-What-do-I-do-if-I-see-Network-connection-failed-, and I get &quot;Error connecting to server!&quot; popping up in the middle-bottom of the screen briefly. Rebooted phone, opened Signal, and the intervening messages all were delivered. Repeated above steps and no messages arrived on my phone and none could be sent. Actual result: The Android app only receives messages after a reboot, and cannot send messages, manage linked devices, or deregister. Expected result: The Android app should be able to send and receive messages normally, open and manage the list of linked devices, and deregister if desired. Note: I'm &quot;still&quot; using the Chrome app on this desktop, having never migrated because the standalone app's GTK usage doesn't play well with my KDE theme or DPI settings. I do have the standalone app installed on another desktop PC (which is how I became aware of the GTK-related problems), and the Chrome app configured on a ChromeOS laptop (which obviously couldn't run the standalone app even if I wanted to there), but I haven't had a chance yet to see if they are also still working.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description After recent problem with new version of Signal (#7171), I had to downgrade. Since then I had a permanent notification of pending update, which was quite inconvenient, as on locked screen it looks exactly the same as a new message. It would be great if there will be a way to disable update notification. Regarding the self-updates notification I wonder about what has changed since #127, where @moxie0 commented that distributing apk only through Play: does not encourage the average user to tick &quot;allow 3rd party APKs&quot; in Android settings. and now Signal updates requires exactly that? Steps to reproduce Install older version of Signal View the update notification Lock screen(with option to hide notification contents)

		Signal offers an offline SMS service, however, when the recipient has a Signal account, I can only send encrypted messages through a WiFi network. It would be preferable if I can still send offline even if there is no encryption. Probably adding a warning might help. This is an issue as Signal will replace the current SMS app to be the default one.

		This may sound (and even be) overly paranoid, but the most advanced encryption in the world is meaningless if using an input method like Google Keyboard, with system-wide microphone access and other permissions. Tonight I had Signal open while watching a discussion on vegetarianism and magically I had a msg populated with &quot;I would die I was sick of being hungry I was sick of beans and rice&quot;. I DID NOT write this, or ever discuss this topic with the contact. Perhaps it's just a random coincidence, but it sounds quite a bit like the endless reports alleging Facebook listening in and serving ads based on ambient audio. Regardless if it's a real security concern, it could be a potential one,. A few ideas: Have the option for Signal to use it's own built in keyboard, similar to those meant to circumvent keyloggers. There are apps like Microphone Block and Camera Block for Android which disable the microphone and camera on a system wide basis. Replicating this functionality in Signal for a &quot;Get Smart: Super Paranoia Cone of Silence Mode&quot; would be a great addition for those that trust Signal/OWS, but maybe not Google Keyboard/Android. This still obviously isn't a 100% guarantee, but could help shift the balance from ubiquitous surveillance to highly targeted surveillance (where it should be, and all we can realistically hope for)...

		Hi there, my father has traveled (from Gemany) to Egypt vor vacation. Although he has a working data connection, my messages over Signal are not delivered (single check marks only). It looks like domain fronting does not turn on. Just my assumption... (Btw. displaying connection state and in addition domain fronting on/off would be great.) I am not sure what exact Signal version he is using. But I suppose one of the latest few (non-beta) releases. 👍 1

		searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description In forwarding a message, groups appear only under recent conversation. This makes it hard to share a message with a group, especially if it has an attachment. Steps to reproduce Make sure some conversations and groups exist Select a message and try to forward it to a group. Actual result: Groups only appear in the following lists under &quot;recent conversations&quot;. This means, if the group does has no recent messages, it cannot be selected here. Also, the search functionality does not find groups in this activity. Expected result: I'd expect groups to appear in the contacts list as well and that they can be found by the search feature. Alternatively, an extra category &quot;groups&quot; could be introduced alongside &quot;recent conversations&quot; and &quot;contacts&quot;. 👍 2

		I use android 7.1.2 without google apps and I'm having big problems using signal calls. Every time I try to make a call with another person with a signal, the call starts and shortly after the call drops and says a lost call. I do not understand how to solve. Maybe with micro-g?

		Hello, One of my friends have some technical problems with Google Play Services, so he can't register his phone number in the Signal app without having an error message from the Google Services. Personnaly, i use signal with a custom rom without GMS, and strangely, i didn't have problems to register (but i didn't tried the voip service with anybody). So it would be cool if you be cool if you develop a version wich would work without GMS for privacy- aware users. Thanks P.s.: To describe briefly my fried's problem, the recovery code that google sends to him never works and is always considered as incorrect, and i don't know why.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description After updating from Signal 4.11.5 to 4.14.10, when opened, Signal did not displayed contact names in the messages view(nor in single message view). Instead it displays numbers and all in gray. Signal groups(and colors set in Signal) are kept with name. Steps to reproduce Update Signal Open Signal Wait for DB to be updated Even after reboot or app restart messages are displayed with number instead of name Actual result: Numbers are displayed instead of names Expected result: Names as in contact list shall be visible. Workaround After clicking &quot;new message&quot;(round blue icon with pen) and waiting few minutes(it seems way too long for loading ~100 contacts), the contacts list gets populated(the view seems to get updated only when scrolling). I might have also &quot;pulled down&quot; the list, which seems to refresh it from contacts. Going back to messages view shows contacts properly.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When creating new message and looking for the contact, user has to search first in alphabetically sorted list of Signal-using contacts and then in alphabetically sorted list of non-Signal-using contacts to find a non-Signal-using recipient. Assuming you don't know if your recipient is using Signal(why should one even care) it adds unnecessary overhead for searching. When using Signal as default SMS app, this results in clunky UX. Steps to reproduce press round blue icon with pen contacts are sorted by those using Signal and those not using it Actual result: Contacts are separated into Signal and non-Signal.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description There are a couple of other issues (#6468, #5992 and WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS#2903) about this problem. One of them has been closed and the other two could've been filed in a more structured way so I'm opening this one hoping we can move this conversation forward in a constructive way. The problem is that Google App Engine blocks connection from Iran and this renders the anti censorship feature of signal useless for Iranian people. This is important now as the authorities are trying to shut down all the secure messaging platforms following the uprising and economical protests. Additionally, Telegram, -the main social media and messaging app for Iranian people-, has been blocked recently and this gives us a golden chance to help people adopt Signal. All it takes is to make sure all the Iranian numbers are being routed through a meek server that is not Google. We at Tor, have tested both Azure and Amazon and they work perfectly fine. I assume this is gonna be the same with other major CDNs as well. Steps to reproduce Try to connect to Signal servers from an Iranian IP address Actual result: Connection fails due to censorship. Expected result: OWS needs to either switch to, or add new meek servers on a platform that isn't Google App Engine and Signal should automatically enable censorship circumvention feature for Iranian phone numbers (+98). Device info Device: Any device Android version: Any device both Anodrid and iOS Here are some additional info for the curious mind: https://twitter.com/CDA/status/947556800328433664 and https://twitter.com/mrphs/status/947601608061353984 Please help us to enable and empower millions of vulnerable people to communicate securely with making this change. 👍 34 ❤️ 2

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When holding the phone in one hand you will most often end up using that hand's thumb to swipe left and right. Naturally, this results in a gesture slightly diagonal (e.g. from bottom left to top right and vice versa for the right hand) rather than exactly horizontal. The gesture detection fails in this case, since it seems to expect a nearly horizontal move, which is nearly impossible to accomplish in one-hand-usage. Hence, the gesture detection should be more &quot;liberal&quot;, if the move direction isn't absolutely accurate. Besides of that, a full screen mode (that can be toggled) would fit in fairly nice. Steps to reproduce open media preview gallery hold phone in one hand and try to use that hand's thumb to swipe left/right Actual result: Gesture detection most often fails to recognize, user gets frustrated Expected result: Gesture detection succeeds to recognize and shows previous/next media Device info Device: Lenovo Moto G 4 Plus (other devices as well) Android version: 7.0 (Android 4.4 as well) Signal version: 4.15.0 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/4ad7a55db59d9c7c09d8d93b7287e481
