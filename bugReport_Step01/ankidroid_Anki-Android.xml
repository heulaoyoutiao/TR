		I noticed that whenever my Android time wasn't automatically synced with the network then: a) No cards appeared ready for reviews in my deck. b) Syncing with server failed. All was fixed by setting the Android time in sync again. No sure if this is known already but I thought I'd flag it in case someone else has this problem.

			<description>
		So, the events for me of today: mild annoyance over some problems in the current stable ankidroid realize there hasn't been a stable ankidroid release since 2.0.1 in february check for the source and find out development has been ongoing try beta feature of play store, url doesn't work after login, throws 404 try to look at the source to see if i can compile it myself and to read up on the changes done in development search and finally find the tag of 2.0.1 to find out that development branches off on an earlier point and then devolves into absolute merge hell, making it impossible to actually read the change log in a sane manner spend two hours to rebuild history with cherry-picking and releasing I ended up with a history as you can see in: https://github.com/wchristian/Anki-Android Screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nic6el1lzzvfhze/ankidroid.png Not a single commit was changed in the rebase/cherry-pick process, they smoothly fit onto one another in a linear fashion. Aside from a single commit where the git algorithm made a mistake i didn't even have any conflicts. I cleaned the entire history going back to the point where current dev and 2.0.1 diverged, all in the space of two hours. The cost of implemeting this in actual ongoing development would be minimal, as it would be only a case of rebasing/cherry-picking the branches github reports as clean for merge. Additionally i'd happily volunteer to do the busywork and offer aid in helping others over any issues they might have with this. What do you say?

		There is a personal Anki sync server available from here: https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server Users of the Anki desktop app can sync against it instead of AnkiWeb by creating a special add-on. However, AnkiDroid has the URL for AnkiWeb hardcoded! It'd be great to allow users to configure the URL of the sync server that they wish to use. There's already an issue for this on Google Code, but it was been marked as &quot;WontFix&quot;: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=154 I'd like to re-open this discussion is possible. :-) I've been running a personal sync server based on this code on Bibliobird.com for almost 3 years (will be in December) and I've deployed it for client projects as well. The code's not perfect but it definitely works enough to be useful for many people! I'd be happy to help with code too, so long as I can get a little direction on where the maintainers think this should be in the application and if they'd even consider merging this feature. Thanks!

			<description>
		What steps will reproduce the problem? When a new card appears, click 10 minutes. The next time it appears, bury it. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? When it is time for another new card, the buried card reappears with the left-most column underlined, i.e. it is again shown as a 'new' card. At this point, one can sync with Ankiweb and then open in desktop the Information (Ctrl-Shift-I) for the card, where the history of clicking '10 minutes' is shown. Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one time? Yes, the bug is completely reproducible. What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)? 2.0.2 beta 6 On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android version) 2.1 To get another 'new' card to appear, I used &quot;Custom Study -&gt; Increase today's new card limit&quot;. I'm not sure if the bug is reproducible with 'natural' new cards.

		Ankidroid seem to check for hint only on the first field, and keeps the same &quot;status&quot; to the next fields, even if they have (or don't). Below I try to give some examples to reproduce the issue: Example 1: Should display second hint Card Displays {{c1::ção}} [...] {{c1::ção::ção}} [...] Inserted hint on first: Card Displays {{c1::ção::ção}} [ção] {{c1::ção::ção}} [ção] Example 2: Card Displays {{c1::without hint}} [...] {{c1::with hint::hint}} [...] Inserted hint on first: Card Displays {{c1::without hint::hint}} [hint] {{c1::with hint::hint}} [hint] Example 3: Card Displays {{c1::without hint::x}} [x] {{c1::with hint::y}} [y] REMOVED hint on second: (edited on ankidroid) {{c1::without hint::x}} {{c1::with hint}} On edition, Freezes Ankidroid (NullPoninterException? see below ... ) Opening again, displays: Card Displays {{c1::without hint::x}} [x] {{c1::with hint}} [null] This 'null' it's not result from creating the card on ankidroid, creating on anki desktop something like {{c1:: x::x}} {{c1::y}} displays [x] [null] on akidroid

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 7 Embedding a sample deck would mean that random Market shoppers get a chance
to see what it's about, and realize that they REALLY need it.

This sample deck would be proposed when opening Anki, as an alternative to
using the browser to look for a deck.

This first page could look like this:

 * Sample
 * Deck found in SD root
 * Other deck found in SD root
 * Deck found in SD /sdcard/anki
 * Other deck found in SD /sdcard/anki
 * Browse for other decks on the SD card.

A sample should be something everybody knows at least a bit, so it can not
be a language or culture-specific thing.

Since spaced repetition is not implemented yet, it should not be too easy,
otherwise people will find it is boring and wasting their time.

I was thinking about a country-capital set of about 30 middle-sized
countries like Peru or Norway.

Of course, this deck should be internationalized together with the
software, because Peru might be written Pérou or 秘鲁 or پیرو in other
languages.

Anyone willing to write a small script to extract this as CSV from
Wikipedia (or DBpedia, easier, if you are not afraid by SPARQL) ?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 8 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. I installed Ankidroid
2. Then I downloaded &quot;Japanese Kana.anki&quot; and &quot;All Kanji for JLPT 1.anki&quot; 
using the desktop Anki.
3. I was not sure where to find those downloaded .anki files then, but I 
found them in C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\.anki\backups
4. I copied them to SD card to directory ../anki/ and changed names, 
because in backups directory they were named like &quot;E!username!Japanese 
Kana.backup-1.anki&quot;
5. After that I started Ankidroid - it could find and open those .anki 
files with no errors.

What is the expected output?

As I understand it should show something.

What do you see instead?

Just white screen with Show answer/Next button, timer and Whiteboard Off/
On button. I can press Show answer/Next button - nothing changes (although 
it might switch something internally, but nothing is shown). Whiteboard 
works OK - I can enable it and write something on the whitescreen.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

Ankidroid 0.1 installed from Android Market. Phone is standard HT-03A from 
NTT, firmware 1.5, kernel 2.6.27-00393-g6607056, build CDB72.

Please provide any additional information below.

I didn't actually try anything yet, I suspect that maybe I copied 
wrong .anki files (maybe backup ones are different somehow) - but there is 
no information about how to do it:

http://ichi2.net/anki/wiki/AndroidAnki

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 11 I think that Android users don't stand for long times doing reviews, they
rather review 3 minutes during breakfast, then 2 minutes while walking,
then 5 minutes in the train, etc.

So we should not bother them with choosing the deck every time they launch
Ankidroid. I think Ankidroid should directly open the last selected deck
(if it exists). The open dialog would still be available by pressing on the
&quot;Menu&quot; key.

What do you think about it?

Cheers,
Nicolas Raoul.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 18 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start Ankidroid on your phone and let it load up a new card.
2. Tip your phone over to have it change orientation.
3. The &quot;Loading deck. Please wait...&quot; dialog appears and there is a long delay until
the new 
card appears.

Since Android restarts the activity on a configuration change like this, it will also
trigger a 
reopen of the database and a reload of the card to show. This is unnecessarily slow
in my 
opinion. Saving the card and just reload the layout should be enough.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 19 When I use the desktop Anki, reviewing usually means pressing
Space-Space-Space-Space-etc because Anki puts the focus on the button that
will most probably be pressed (which is &quot;remembered&quot; for us).

The advantage is that answering is much faster, which leads to a more
efficient use of the user's time. This is even more true for Android,
because touching a zone on the screen is nowhere as fast as pressing a
physical key. Especially in a crowded subway.

So I suggest putting the focus on &quot;Remembered&quot; automatically, and of course
on &quot;Show answer&quot; too. Users will just keep clicking their phone's central
button, and touch the screen just when they didn't remember.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 24 I noticed this bug when I was trying to test if Deck Picker would be able
to handle a huge number of decks, so I copied all decks on my Anki decks
folder on my computer to my phone. 

Then, the Deck Picker crashed every time, but investigating a little I
discovered it was due a file named &quot;._AC.anki&quot; not because there were so
many decks. I supposed this deck it's a kind of temporary file Anki Desktop
made for one of my real decks.

For the user it could be kind of disturbing and annoying if he cannot open
the Deck Picker because of some hidden file he copied even without being
aware of it. The solution would be try to open all the files ending with
.anki but only show the ones that are real anki files (that is to say,
handling the SQLExceptions correctly).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 26 If you try to load a deck without any card in Ankidroid the app is going to
crash. 

This Exception can be handled easily in order to avoid the crash, but then
I'm not sure what would be the most desirable behaviour: Should we show an
empty card? Should we show in addition a dialog to let know to the user
what happened?

If somebody has some idea, it would be great hear what you think about it
before I start implementing a solution.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 27 I'm using my decks generated by Anki Desktop and the WebView used in
Ankidroid does not display correctly formatted all text (for example, the
bold letter).

I want to investigate why this happens, maybe not all HTML tags are
supported in Android. In that case, maybe the text in the card has to be
parsed and change the tags that don't work for others that do.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 28 It would be great to have a system to notify our users when a new version
of Ankidroid is released to Android Market, because sometimes can be
difficult to let know them in other ways and we want users to have and
enjoy the last improvements.

The general method is explained here:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 29 I would like to see a feature similar to the PC version where I am able to 
schedule a set amount of new cards per day and known cards are remembered. 
This is vital to my use of memorizing the Heisig deck. Currently, I am 
forced to make my own custom decks each day so that I can add a set amount 
steadily.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 32 Is it possible to load cards from the deck in their original order instead of in random
on the 
first time it is opened? If the deck has 2000 odd entries, it is useless to start on
the 500th 
card when you may not be up to there yet. Need an option to load cards in order or
shuffle. 
Untilled that is there I can't use ankidroid. I have had it on my phone for some time
and it is 
useless as is to study kanji. Is this built on the assumption that the entire deck
has been 
previously studied? What happens whenever the information being studied is new? 
Especially with kanji,  it needs to go in order at first view, ads should start after
the card has 
been learnt, then it becomes a review. Perhaps a learn mode and a review mode would
be 
a good way. If this feature is there the apparently would be 1000x more useable, because
its 
useless to me to srs cards which are ahead of my level and yet to be studied.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 38 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Navigate to DeckPicker (Menu &gt; Switch to another deck)
2. Select a deck with cards to review
3. Answer a card and quickly mount the sd card

When you answer the card a thread is launched to update and commit the
changes asynchronously and if the connection with the DB is lost while
doing it (like mounting the sd card) an Exception is thrown and the app
crashes.

What could we do about that? I think it's impossible to really finish the
commit so the options that I thought are:

- Show to the user a message informing him that the data could not be saved :(
- Use some structure or database like a backup and commit to the real deck
when the connection with the database is available again

Do you have any other idea?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 40 Since people can not add new cards using AnkiDroid, it would be useful to
be able to download existing decks, like in the Desktop Anki.

That would be especially useful for people who have never used Anki
Desktop. They could start studying without having to create their own deck
yet. Creating your own deck can not be avoided in the long term, but using
an existing deck gets one started fast.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 43 Like the &quot;Review Early&quot; funcionality on Anki Desktop it would be great if
after all reviews for the day are done, the user has the possibility to
keep reviewing cards.

Now this funcionality is even more necessary and appropiate because, how
Nicolas reported, with some decks the SRS is not working properly and is
showing the &quot;Session time limit reached&quot; after every card, not allowing the
users review their cards. Also for testing purposes it would be a great
improvement because I usually spend more than 10 minutes testing and I
finish all reviews... and it's a little annoying if I have to reset the
intervals with Anki Desktop every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 44 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. create a directory on sdcard and load a deck in the directory
2. select &quot;preferences&quot; -&gt; &quot;Deck Path&quot; and specify your new path
3. look for deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect to see your new deck.  Only see the deck(s) that are in the root dir.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
A recent version of Ankidroid off from github (with SRS, sound, image
support).  The version on the market worked fine for me.

I miss a search option in Ankidroid. Sometimes I think of answers that 
don't match the correct one and wonder what my answer means (damn 
chinese tones!). Since my deck grows at the same pace I learn, it 
would be way faster to search in the deck than using a dictionary 
(which is my current workaround).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 50 I installed anki droid and found to my dismay that the .mov files I
use in my flash cards do not play. This, despite the fact that the
movies play on my Nexus One if I access them via another program.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 51 Question: 空白
Answer: Space

The first time I meet this fact, I am quite confused.
What do they mean by &quot;Space&quot;, I need to look it up in a dictionary.
The best dictionary I have found so far is Aedict (just like Gjiten), 
which says:
空白 = blank space; vacuum; space; null (NUL)
It gives me a much better idea of the concept, and I will learn a concept 
I actually understand.

It would be great to have a &quot;Look up&quot; menu option to directly send me to 
Aedict, or maybe an online dictionary like Wiktionary if Aedict is not 
installed.

It would look up for the currently displayed expression, be it a question 
or an answer.

If I want to look up a single word within a longer sentence, it should 
not to hard for the user to erase the extra words manually in the 
dictionary software itself.

I know there is about 1300 cards that have to be reviewed, but still 
AnkiDroid shows &quot;Unable to find a card&quot; after 10 or 20 reviews, everyday.

Have you ever seen this problem ?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 55 I have the HTC Tattoo, and Ankidroid cannot be found on the market. I
suspect it is because Tattoo has a QVGA resolution (320*240). Apps using
API 3 must declare support for QVGA, or will not appear in the Market for
these devices.

Proposed changes:
1. Use API level 4 or greater
OR
2. declare
 [supports-screens 
     android:largeScreens=&quot;true&quot; 
     android:normalScreens=&quot;true&quot; 
     android:smallScreens=&quot;true&quot; 
     android:anyDensity=&quot;false&quot;/]

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 58 AnkiDroid development is hard to understand for newcomers (for instance 
experienced developers who are not familiar with Android or Git).

That's a shame because we would probably get much more features and cool 
experiments, much quicker, if we had more developers.

We should create an &quot;AnkiDroid developer tutorial&quot; page on the Wiki, 
detailing:
- Github
- ADT
- Eclipse ADT
- Importing the source
- local.properties .classpath
- Commit and pull requests
- Update

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 59 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Load a deck and finish reviewing old and new cards; in 0.4alpha, the
&quot;Unable to find a card!&quot; screen
2. Restart the application, possibly by rebooting the phone or termination
(or crash) or Ankidroid
3. Try to load the original deck. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see &quot;Unable to find a card!&quot;, but instead it shows that &quot;No
deck loaded. Please, press menu and select one of the decks stored in your
sd card.&quot; This might lead the user to believe Ankidroid failed to load the
deck, but in reality just didn't find a card to display.

When we fix the &quot;Unable to find a card!&quot; prompt to an appropriate message,
we should display that.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
0.4alpha on HTC Tattoo, Android 1.6

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 64 I used to record this video demonstration of AnkiDroid 0.1:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHfQH-UeDpM

It is very out-of-date, in particular the deck picker works very 
differently now.

Could someone record a new video in the same style?
Good way to attract hundreds of viewers to your channel!

By the way, other fan videos may show some cool features like writing 
kanjis on the whiteboard or editing a card.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 65 I really wanted to crash AnkiDroid so I did the following:
- open deck picker
- delete one of the decks using astro
- long press home key to come back to anki
- open the deleted deck

No user would probably ever do that, so it is very low priority.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 67 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck.
2. Click &quot;Answer&quot;.
3. Click &quot;Easy&quot; like crazy, as many times as you can.

What is the expected output?
Next card is shown after a few seconds.

What do you see instead?
AnkiDroid shows a spinning &quot;Loading new card...&quot; forever (or at least a 
long time, still spinning after 2 minutes)

The solution is probably to not take extra clicks into account, by having 
a &quot;clicked&quot; flag that is reset every time a new display is shown. Should 
ideally prevent one from clicking &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Good&quot; quickly after.

It seems unreasonable to click that much, but we can expect some users to 
do this, and yesterday it actually happened to me by mistake, I did not 
realized my finger was close to the screen and clicking repeatedly.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 68 It fails to load the decks and display the cards. The way it fails depends on whether
the capitals deck is 
present or not in the sdcard.

- With the capitals deck not present
It doesn't create the capitals deck on the sd.

If there aren't any decks in the root of the sdcard it shows an empty list and gives
a force close [fc] when 
pressing back button. Therefore there is no option to select another folder since the
menu is in the previous 
activity.

If there are decks other than the capitals it displays them with a 'loading' status
which goes forever. 
Selecting any of the decks gives a fc.

- With the capitals deck
Displays a message Failed to load deck. Allows to change to another deck and configure
the decks path but still 
fails to load any of them.

I'm using Ankidroid 0.4 beta1 running on a Nexus one with Android 2.1 (actually CM5.0.4.1
but also tested with 
stock rom with same result).

-------------------------------------------
I haven't created a set of issues for each one of the bugs since I thing (hope) they
are all related.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 69 I noticed something strange on two of my decks:

If &quot;new cards spacing&quot; = &quot;after reviews&quot;, then after reviews the 
&quot;Congratulations&quot; message appears. Even though limits are far from 
reached and there are thousands of new cards waiting.

If I switch &quot;new cards spacing&quot; to &quot;after reviews&quot; then the new cards 
appear.

Yesterday I tested this for 20 minutes, switching the setting back and 
forth, and the issue was always happening.

Nothing special appears in the log.

Other study options, just in case:
New Cards / Day: 200000
Session Time Limit: 0
Session Question Limit: 0

Maybe related:
When &quot;New cards spacing&quot; is set to &quot;spread out through reviews&quot;, I have 
the feeling that sometimes the &quot;Congratulations&quot; message is shown too 
early.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 74 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. No problem - it's an enhancement or change request.
2. The default directory for AnkiDroid seems to be the root of /sdcard. 
This directory can get cluttered if one is dealing with several decks, plus
all the data from other applications.  I propose moving the default
directory to a sub-directory under /sdcard just for the sake of tidiness,
and to keep all ankidroid related data together.  I use /sdcard/ankidroid/,
but others may be better?


Please provide any additional information below.
There is an issue (#73) with audio in subfolders - might want to look at
that before making this change live....or perhaps making this change will
solve the other problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 80 Desktop Anki has a cram mode which is a good last-minute solution to study
for tests. It allows one to filter only certain cards (by tag) and puts no
limits on the study time or ordering of cards. It also lowers the timing
for repetition of cards by a lot (a few minutes instead of hours). It also
never stops showing cards.

&quot;
I think ive found the issue. Make sure you have ASE, as well as the
browser completly shut down before you open ankidroid as ankimini and
ASE are using the deck which gives ankidroid errors.

So basicly if both of the programs are using it at the same time it
will crash ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 94 Basically a widget you can put on your home screen which displays your
decks and the number of cards due. A bonus would be to set it to raise a
notification (or vibrate) when a preset number of cards are due.

I managed to implement a basic proof of concept of this quite quickly from
the 0.4 branch by using
http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/introducing-home-screen-widgets-and.html
as an example and just copying and pasting the code from the DeckPicker
class into the buildUpdate method.

A couple of extra things. It'd be handy to abstract the fetching of decks
in populateDeckList(String location) as well as fetching of the deck data
in the run() method so they could be used by the widget. I think there may
be some concurrency issues as well when the deck is already in use by the
widget.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 97 Current situation:
When a user finishes a deck, s/he is presented with a message and a big 
&quot;Review early&quot; button, which is very tempting. It is the only button, so 
it may look like it is a natural thing to do.

Problem:
Reviewing early is not something we should encourage, because it has 
drawbacks in terms of review efficiency.

Solution:
Show a &quot;Switch to another deck&quot; button above the &quot;Review early&quot; button.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
One would expect to see the linked image.  Instead, a white question mark
on a small blue background is displayed.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Stock AnkiDroid off the Market running on Motorola Droid with 2.1-update1

Please provide any additional information below.
I have attached below a deck that was created in Anki using the Smart.fm
Importer plug-in.  The desktop version of Anki does display the images.  I

Hey, I wanted to use my farsi flashcards but the Persian characters
don't show up. They're pretty similar to arabic characters, which i
assume also dont work. Is there any workaround so that I can use these
on my phone?

Let's keep a list of characters that are known to not work:
- Farsi (reported by Ryan)
- Arabic (reported by Casey)
- Ancient Greek polytonic diacritic marks (issue 77)

Those issues seems to be a limitation of Android.
The workarounds seems not be out of reach for the typical user.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 102 Ankidroid should have a way to change the font used.
This would be incredibly helpful ex. when studying Japanese kanji.
In the desktop Anki I used to use the KanjiStrokeOrder font since that 
greatly increases the readability and adds the ability to learn kanji stroke 
orders while studying.


Thanks for all the hard work !

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 103 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck a proceed through the cards.
2. The &quot;congratulations you have finished&quot; dialog appears after a few cards when there

should be more to review.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
All deck settings are set so as to be able to review 20 new cards with unlimited session
time 
and unlimited questions. Should be able to review a greater number of car
ds. 

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Using on android 1.6 on xperia x10 (so10 japanese model)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 104 If it is doable and does make make AnkiDroid slower, that would be nice.
That could allow other people to write Anki versions for a huge range of
devices.
In the mobile market, smartphones are a minority. Smaller cellphones are
the norm. And most of them can run Java applications.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 105 I think the lack of this creates some confusion in AnkiDroid. In Anki it's
hidden away under the advanced deck properties (defaults to 20). The review
early functionality should sort most of the problem out of not been able to
carry on reviewing.

Basically what happens is you set a huge number of new cards per day,
unlimited session, questions etc. After answering lots of questions the
&quot;you've completed this deck message&quot; comes up, even though you still have
lot's of new questions to answer. If you look in the deck picker, it still
says lots of cards are due, but you can't carry on with any cards. The
reason: you've hit the maximum number of failed cards, but there's no where
in AnkiDroid to see this so it's not obvious. In fact you have to wait for
one of the failed cards to become due so you can reduce the number of
failed cards and carry on.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 106 Version 0.4

Once you complete a deck and get the deck complete message, whenever you
come back the message remains. So if you go to the home screen and come
back a few hours later the message remains. The fix is go back to the deck
picker and reopen the deck, then it regenerates the due cards and it's back
to normal, but this is non obvious and if you continously complete your
deck if 30 minutes or so, it gets a tad annoying.

I'm not sure about the best way to fix this though, but maybe the @onresume
for the activity? If you have at least one card still due it's not a
problem, only when there are no cards due, so do a check if no cards are due.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 109 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck.
2. Review some cards/complete a review session (not sure if this step is
necessary).
3. Wait a few days.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The due cards count keep increasing even if ankiDroid is not used. Let's
say the number of new cards added per day is 30, if I don't check ankiDroid
for 3 days I find 90 new cards waiting for review.

I expect to have new cards added just if I use ankiDroid, even better, just
when I finish a review session.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Tested both in the current market release and in a beta release for the
synchronization (was it from Edu?).

I know a SRS system should be used daily (that will free me from this
issue) but sometimes I just can't and finding lots of cards waiting for me
(more than I can process) keeps me from reviewing (increasing the number of
new cards added ;)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 117 First of all thank you so much for this great program. I have always found it easy to
learn but difficult to remember what I have learned. The idea of being able to recall
the necessary stuff in breaks at work or on the move has really turned my life around.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. A card with any picture file (jpg)
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Like on AnkiMini I hoped that the picture would be scaled to fit the screen and one
could then zoom if necessary. I know this is not a feature of the desktop version but
on a portable device it would be really useful.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

I am using the latest version on a HTC Desire with android 2.1.

PS: I would be happy to pay for the features I would like to have in the product.

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 133 App crashed upon loading deck.  Upon recovery deck seemed to function correctly except
for when selecting &quot;Again&quot; upon failing a card.

Instead of showing the card again a few minutes later, pressing &quot;Again&quot; consistently
caused the card to be shown again immediately.

This has happened to two decks now, but cannot be reproduced at will.

This issue was still present after running CheckDB.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 134 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. copy .anki file to sd card on HTC Desire.
2. open anki.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected it to read the anki file successfully, instead the following error appears:
The Application Ankidroid (process com.ichi2.anki) has stopped unexpectedly. Please
try again. [Force close].

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Dont know how to find out version number, installed from android app store no more
than 12 days ago. Android Firmware 2.1.

Please provide any additional information below.
The .anki deck that failed was: Core 2000 Japanese Vocabulary.anki
also tried Massive Intermediate Japanese Deck.anki with same result.

Clicking force quit on the error message simply brings the message up again. It has
to be tricked by continuously pressing the mobiles back button while pressing force
quit until it exits (usually second or third attempt).

also tried changing the decks sdcard directory with same problem.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 137 It would be nice if ankidroid could have a separate policy regarding whether cards with
X tags are shown. The reason being that some cards you do want to see (on the desktop
version), but for whatever reason do not want to see on the anki version (maybe you
don't have headphones on, maybe sentences require too much time and you usually use
ankidroid for a second here and there).

I recommend a page that displays tags similar to the &quot;Inactive tags...&quot; dialog in the
desktop version.

The difference being the following:

- tags with a green background are shown on ankidroid and are registered the normal
way as being shown (so the desktop version will show it)

- tags with yellow are not shown on ankidroid but if you sync the deck and use it on
the desktop it will be shown

- tags with a red background are not shown on either ankidroid or the desktop version

And, tapping on the card will have it rotate among the various settings

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 138 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.  Review cards with a deck on my MacBook.  This includes 10 new cards daily, which
is how many new cards I want each day.
2.  Synchronize the deck on my MacBook online.
3.  Synchronize the deck on my HTC Evo with Ankidroid.
4.  Review cards in Ankidroid.  This again includes 10 new cards, which is 10 more
than I want because I have already had 10 new cards with regular Anki.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would like Ankidroid to be able to recognize when I have already gone through the
new cards for the day, and not give me new cards if I have done so.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
I am using Anki 1.0.0 on Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Ankidroid 0.5alpha1 on my HTC Evo with
Android 2.2.

Please provide any additional information below.
Thanks for making a great piece of software!

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 139 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Edit the default country-capitals file to have some style formatting, eg Question
color set to red.

2. Save the new country-capitals file to a path other than the default one in the cellphone.

3. Open the country-capitals file in the default location (like from fresh install)

4. Change the deckpath to the one where the edited deck is found.

5. Switch to the country-capitals deck (now it's the new one)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expected that the new style would take effect. Instead the old one is used
(black). If I kill AnkiDroid and start it again, then the new style takes effect as
the Models hash maps are repopulated anew.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Anki 0.4.1, android 2.2, nexus one.

Please provide any additional information below.
The issue raises the question of how fresh the values in a cache hashmap of Android
applications. When the application is closed (paused in reality), it might restart
several hours/days later with cached values that are really stale.
I suggest we reset the Model caches during onResume() or onCreate()

This issue is similar to http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=115 but,
in this case, AnkiDroid will open an actual anki deck, and not build one from a serie
of facts.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 141 Just the ability to install the app on the SD card, to save some space.

Requires Android 2.2, so the location should be set to auto, meaning that the app will
install by default on normal memory, unless the latter is running low, in which case
it installs on SD card. This setting also allows the user to move the app to the SD,
after having it installed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 145 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Install the last development version of AnkiDroid master branch (http://github.com/iniju/Anki-Android/commit/3235cb8dd9601fe0cdfe896b1f31105dbb8061c3)
2. Launch AnkiDroid and you could see that the option to display both question and
answer at the same time is selected by default
3. Go to 'Menu' &gt; 'Preferences'
4. Go back, and now only the question or the answer is displayed, but not both at the
same time

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

If we don't change any option in Preferences, the expected behaviour would be to keep
everything the way it was before entering Preferences.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 147 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck, eg country-capitals. Set the preference &quot;Write answer&quot; to off.

2. View a question, then show the answer.

3. Go to preferences and set &quot;Write answer&quot; to show.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect that the buttons for difficulty will be still shown when I exit preferences
screen. Instead they disappear. They appear again, if I redisplay question and then
show answer again.

While annoying, it's even worse when the option for &quot;Show question in answer&quot; is set
to show, because then the button &quot;Redisplay Question&quot; is missing as expected, but that
leaves me stuck, as the only button remaining is the one for whiteboard. To move on,
I have to switch decks and select the same again.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 151 It would be wonderful if Ankidroid could make use of the built in Android text to speech
program to read out cards. I have in mind language learning and the option of turning
on text to speech to get an approximate idea of pronunciation. 

Either on a card by card basis with the manual operation of a button, or selecting
which cards (Forward cards for example), which would be automatically read out.

This could be useful for people in the subway, or walking on the street, or even riding

click = OK
double click = Failed
triple click = Easy
quadruple click = Difficult

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Go to 'Preferences' and activate the 'Write answers' option
2. Write an answer for the current card
3. Show answer and grade it
4. You will see that in the EditText your previous answer is still there

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I will expect the EditText to be empty every time a new card is shown.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 164 I really like to use anki but somethimes because of my work, being busy and....
I miss it for several days.

Adding a reminder for example, like poping up a flashcard and having settings for it
could be really a great addon.

for example you set it for 8 hr, and each 8hr a flashcard appears.just like some learning
tools in PC.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 167 In version 0.4.1 

In the screen with my decks I can see cards due, cards new left to study and full size
of the deck. 
But I can not see how many cards I have never answered. 

So I got no idea in any given deck how far I am from answering all the cards at least
once...

I would like to see

due left    new left today / total new left / full size 
or optionally 

XX%  due left    new left today  / full size 

Where XX% is how % of cards I have reviewed at least once. 

As days goes by the XX% will increase, that is pretty encouraging.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 173 Ripped from the Anki website:
Marked cards are cards that have been starred. Marking a card allows you to easily
find the card later. If you're reviewing away from home for example, and you're not
sure if you've spelt something wrong, you can mark the card and search for marked cards
later in the browser, when you have access to a dictionary.

If nobody's working on it already, I'd like to give it a try.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 179 An idea I wanted to suggest was is that when the user has only one card left to review,
and fails it, that should end the review like in the desktop mode.  In AnkiDroid, the
card is then shown again immediately.  In the desktop version, the card is delayed,
and in most cases that means it will be the first card you review in your next session.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 182 I think it would be more practical to find on start first the deck picker and not an
open deck used last. I have more than one deck and when I start to learn I first want
to see an overview what has to be learned. 
Maybe there could be introduced an option for this?

1. 'Menu' &gt; 'Preferences'
2. Activate the 'Write answers' option
3. In the first card to review, write the answer
4. Press 'Show Answer'

Doing that you will see that the soft keyboard is hiding partly or totally the answer.
I would expect not having to always press the back button in order to hide the soft
keyboard after answering a card, that could be done automatically.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 184 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review a deck in Anki, but leave some cards due/failed
2. Sync to server
3. Sync deck in AnkiDroid
4. The card count will be off by a few, it seems to update the count to the correct
(maybe?) count as soon as a new card is done instead of a failed/due card.
5. If you sync to the server from AnkiDroid, the count will be messed up in Anki (like
right now I have different counts in my AnkiDroid deck than on my Anki deck even though
it says the deck is synced. I'm not sure if it's just the count being messed up or
the designation of the card being due/failed (which would obviously be much more concerning).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
When you sync with card remaining to be reviewed/failed, the counters in AnkiDroid
should be the same as the counters in Anki, but the count is off.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid 5.alpha3 on Froyo
Anki 1.0.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Sorry if the explanation is a little confusing, I'm not 100% sure how to replicate
this.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. 'Menu' &gt; 'Preferences'
2. Activate the 'Write answers' option
3. Review the first card
4. When the second card appears you will see that the soft keyboard is not automatically
displayed, forcing you to do an additional press on the EditText

Like you explicity said you want to write the answers, I would expect the soft keyboard
to show automatically every time for each question, saving in this way time and clicks
for part of the user.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 189 AnkiDroid already focuses the default button depending on the type of the card (young
or mature) but this is only noticeable if you are using the trackball while reviewing
(because the focus does not affect in touch mode).

NorbertNagold suggested if we can improve that and make it more noticeable: maybe put
the default button in other color or underline the label?

What other ideas do you have to implement that?

When I edit a card in AnkiDroid and use the new sync feature the
changes don't sync correctly to Anki Desktop:

On Anki Desktop I sync to check if the edit done on the phone was
synced to the pc but it's strange because when I search for the fact
on AnkiDesktop it shows the edit on the index but not on the bigger
display boxes below. And also on Anki Desktop when the card
(previously edited in AnkiDroid) comes up while reviewing it does not
show the changes previously made while on AnkiDroid.

For now I'll stick to Dropbox whenever I have to edit facts on the
phone.

Thanks for Anki and Ankidroid! They're awesome!

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
ankidroid should accept passwords with non-alphanumeric character (e.g. _,-, ...) but,
instead, is rejecting them before contacting the server.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
5.x

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 197 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. load attached sample deck
2. step through cards

What is the expected / proposed output?
An image that fits the size of the screen for the device your are using.

What do you see instead?
an image at ?full? size - too large to fit screen, requiring user to scroll to see
the whole thing.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid-0.5alpha4-sync-EXPERIMENTAL.apk on Motorola Droid with 2.2 (FRG22D)

Please provide any additional information below.
I'm not sure if this would always be desirable - it's conceivable that some images
need to be full size to be properly viewed.  But from my limited experience, auto-scaling
would be good.

Sorry if the sample deck is to US centric - it's one I got with desktop Anki and iKnow
plugin.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 198 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Display the question part of your card
2. Lock your phone (or switch to another application)
3. Switch back to AnkiDroid
4. The timer has continued in the background.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The timer should pause when AnkiDroid is not active. I wouldn't have noticed except
I was playing with the default deck and the session time limit was reached, even though
I had locked my phone.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 200 What steps will reproduce the problem?
---In the Desktop Anki
1. Create a deck. Format the fields, save it, like usual. [e.g.: sample.anki]
2. Make a copy from the deck in your file manager, or with save as, or with export.
[e.g.: copy.anki]
3. Open the new deck, mess with the formatting, and save it. 
4. Upload the decks to the phone
---In AnkiDroid
5: Open the sample.anki. Looks good. After that switch to the copy.anki. Formatted
exactly like the sample.anki. If you kill anki from the memory, and open the copy.anki,
it is good. If you switch to the sample.anki, it will be formatted as per the copy.anki.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expected different formatting, but there is no format change between the decks I
mentioned before, even if I open different decks. The only solution is to kill AnkiDroid
from the memory.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Android 2.1, AnkiDroid 0.4.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Please check on it, because it was really annoying and confusing when I tried to optimize
the formatting to the AnkiDroid ;)

AnkiDroid under this name too.

Are there other languages where people would write AnkiDroid using a different writing

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Uncompress the attached deck on '/sdcard/AnkiDroid'

I expect the sync to finish correctly and the deck to be uploaded to AnkiOnline. Instead
of that, AnkiDroid just crashes.

In a card with an image on the question
1. Make zoom in or zoom out

3. If you made zoom in you will see that the image is now zoomed out and if you made

I will expect that answering or grading a card will reset the zoom to the default value
or at least leave it with the same value that it had.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 205 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review a deck until you get the screen that says 'Well Done!' (session completed)
or the one that says 'Congratulations!' (when there are no more cards to review)
2. Rotate the device

You will see that the view with 'Study Options' appears, which does not seem consistent.
It should maintain the same view it had before because the state of the deck has not
changed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 211 Reported by MFO:

One study option I'd like is the choice to make the first line of the answer appear
when I press Show Answer.  I like having the question and answer shown so that I can
refer back to the question.  In cards where the front has a full screen worth of of
text, you can't see the answer without scrolling down.  I would prefer to have the
first couple lines of the answer shown, even though that pushes the question partly
out of view.  The reason some of my cards have to much text is that I often add example
sentences for my vocabulary words

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 214 When a fact has multiple cards, AnkiDesktop spreads the cards out so you don't see them
all within a short period.  I think it's about 10 minutes of delay between cards. 
This would be a nice addition to AnkiDroid if it's simple to implement.  In fact, I
think this use to happen in earlier builds.

Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 215 Hello,

I've noticed that the nifty counter added in 0.5alpha3 has moved from the right of
the screen to the left in alpha6.  Might I suggest moving it up to the bar above it
in a future build?

The top of my screen displays in two lines:
[german (147 of 22119 due)         ] (dark background)
[0 147 30                          ] (white background)

My suggestion:
[german (147 of 22119)    0 147 30 ] (dark background)

It seems like there is enough space unless someone's deck title is really long.  Then
it might cause another issue.

thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 217 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Learn cards
2. Open another program (e.g. answer a call)
3. Switch back to AnkiDroid

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid 0.5, beta 8

Please provide any additional information below.

I learned a bunch of 62 due cards and reduced them down to 10 cards (all all them were
cards I didn't know a the first try, in other words: &quot;red ones&quot;). Then I had to use
another app and went afterwards back to AnkiDroid. 
Now the deck summary showed again 62 cards and when I started to learn them again the
congrats screen popped up immediately.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 220 We have 35 Java classes in src.com.ichi2.anki and it starts to take a bit of time when
looking for a class or to understand which set of classes is involved in which area.

To make it more maintainable and attractive to developers, I suggest distributing the
classes into a few packages.

What packages should it be?
- Maybe SRS+database code into a package
- Then network-related things like shared decks and sync
- The UI would probably have its own

Notes:
AnkiDroidApp.java must stay at the same place to avoid install-time problems.
Move files using &quot;git mv path destination&quot;.

Audio doesn't need to be played each time the orientation changes but only when the
card is first shown or when touch the &quot;play&quot; button.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 223 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.
Start downloading a shared deck that takes long time. Wait a bit.
2.
Start downloading a shared deck that takes short time to finish.
3.
Wait until the short one finishes and watch the list of downloads.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the short one to be removed and the long one to remain, instead, the long
one is removed and the short one remains showing fully completed. In reality the long
one is still being updated, but the information shown is for the short one.

If the short download was first in the list, then it all works properly. The issue
is with removing downloads that are completed further down the list.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 224 The built-in zoom controls in Android are placed by default depending on the device
and they take a long time to fade out, making it difficult to see part of the card

Programatically, we cannot show or hide the built-in controls on demand or change the
default fade out time, so I guess we will have to create custom zoom controls for it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 226 For the benefit of the Anki Triage system, it's important to make the time stamps included
in the crash report locale independent, as it simplifies parsing a lot and reduces
the chance of unknown timezone errors.
It's also very tidy.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 228 Some shared downloaded decks easily take more than one hour for updating (eg Moder Chinese
Character Frequency List - 9937 facts).

During that time the phone is working very intensely in the background even after AnkiDroid
is closed, slowing down general performance.

While the PAUSE/RESUME capability will help fix that issue a bit, any idea for speeding
up the overall process is welcome.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 229 When a card with a LaTeX expression is displayed in Anki Desktop, a picture for this
expression its generated.

If AnkiDroid finds a LaTeX expression it could try to see if the picture for this expression
is already generated and, in that case, show it in the card.

For this reason I say only &quot;partial&quot; support, because AnkiDroid would not generate
the correspondent image from LaTeX.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 232 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck with cards containing images (I only tested images, since none of
my decks have audio anyway) and save it with Korean characters in the filename (may
actually be any non-Latin characters, but I've only tried Korean).
2. Either copy this deck to the device or sync it via Anki-Online then copy the media
folder manually (same behavior both ways).
3. Attempt to view any card with an image using AnkiDroid v0.5 alpha 8.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
X displayed instead of the expected image.  Confirmed this happens for static GIF,
animated GIF, JPG, and PNG.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Motorola Droid X (Android 2.2)
AnkiDroid 0.5 alpha 8

Please provide any additional information below.
This bug does not occur in the marketplace version of AnkiDroid, but does in 0.5 Alpha
8 (have not tried other versions than those two).  After a fair bit of testing, the
only consistency I can find is Korean characters in the filename.  Attached is a sample
deck that works fine with the marketplace version of AnkiDroid, but will not load images
in 0.5 alpha 8.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 234 I think this should not be allowed because:

- There's little reason for someone to want to do this, unless accidentally.
- Problem with media folder. When the first of the two finishes the media folder gets
moved. The second doesn't have a media folder. Not a big problem as they can share
it, except what if I cancel one download (media folder should get deleted, then the
other other doesn't have one).

Do you mind if we disallow downloading a shared deck while its download is ongoing?

On a related topic. What happens if I download a shared deck that I already have and
use? Will it overwrite the old one? What about the media folder?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 236 hello,

In many of my vocabulary cards, I have a few example sentences or comments.  These
tend to fill the entire screen, so when I press &quot;Show Answer&quot; I have to manually scroll
down to actually see the answer.  In fact, when I start to scroll down myself, the
little zoom in/zoom out buttons appear and block me from seeing the answer. Then it's
a 3-4 seconds' wait for them to disappear.

Would you all consider having AnkiDroid automatically scroll down enough to show the
first line or two of the answer? My preference is to keep showing the question so that
I may refer back to it.

Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 239 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start downloading a personal deck
2. Lose connectivity to the internet during the download
3. Phone responsiveness slows down and eventually (few minutes later) results to automatic
rebooting

My phone is Nexus One, running Android 2.2.

There seems to be some kind of onPause - onResume cycle triggered by the release of
the InputStream in the finally clause of the try block where the personal download
happens, in DownloadManagerService.java, when I lose connectivity.

Working on fixing this, this issue is for record keeping.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 246 First let me apologize for not being able to pinpoint or describe this issue very well.
I'll do my best.

This is more of a quirk than an issue. I've set the fonts and background colors on
almost all of my models. I've noticed that these settings sometimes bleed into the
models I've never adapted from the defaults.  That is to say, that cards I'm expecting
to have a black font and white background may have the color scheme of a previous card
from a different model.

My theory, strange and uneducated as it is, is that this could be related to the fact
that I formed almost all of my models at a COPY of another model.  On my desktop Anki,
I used to have problems with merging decks that had models that were copies of each
other. I had split off some decks from my main deck and later decided to merge them
back in. Even if I had changed the model names and attributes, it was like they somehow
instinctually found each other once again when merged and started mingling, sometimes
completely supplanting another model.

Part of that problem was that I was exporting the cards from the smaller decks by directly
writing to bigger deck.  Since then, that function has been disabled since it wasn't
Damien's intention for the export function. I think now it would replace the entire
deck, but back then, it added the exported cards to the existing deck.  I only mention
all of this in case it could be related to how the models are treated in the desktop
software as well.  In the desktop version I don't have this fonts/colors issue however.

I also believe this enhancement will also be useful in the work for adding/deleting
cards.

In any case, I did some work on this while upgrading AnkiDroid for libanki 1.1 compatibility.
This issue is for book-keeping.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 249 Damien will remove the wiki from his website, so we have to migrate it.
See https://groups.google.com/group/anki-android/browse_thread/thread/42ab9297dac536ab

Message from Damien:

Hi folks,

The wiki is a source of confusion to many users, who try to log in
there to get to AnkiOnline, or to upload decks. The wiki's also not
conducive to offline help, which I'd like to add to Anki in a future
release. So I'll be taking the wiki down soon, but leaving a read-only
copy of the pages available so previous documentation links are not
broken.

AnkiDroid should be able to move their wiki pages to their Google code
hosting. The docs will eventually be moved into the Anki sources, so
updates to things like the FAQ could be done via git. For the few
other pages, please host the content elsewhere like on a free Google
sites page, and let me know if you want the original pages to be
updated to link to your new hosting area.

Cheers,
Damien 

&gt; Ok, I've generated static pages of the wiki content and set up the old
&gt; links to redirect there. If you need access to the source of the wiki
&gt; pages and the attachments from those pages, you can download them from
&gt; http://ankisrs.net/download/wikicode.tgz

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 251 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. 'Menu' &gt; 'Preferences'
2. Activate the 'Write answers' option
3. Review a card and when the soft keyboard appears, it will hide the 'Show Answer'
button and push out of the screen the timer and the counts

What is the expected output?
The expected behaviour would be that the screen is resized but everything is still
visible on it.

After investigating deeply this issue I have found that this is a bug of Android when
fullscreen is being used:
http://www.vogella.de/blog/2010/10/25/android-windowsoftinputmode/

Anyway, I note here the issue in case we want to try a custom solution in the future,
like implementing an InputMethodService.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 252 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck in Anki which you are already syncing between Anki and AnkiDroid
2. Choose &quot;tools &gt; advanced &gt; check database&quot;. The database will be rebuild and the
full deck will be uploaded to the anki-server on next time sync
3. Sync this deck now on AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? 
the full deck should be downloaded

What do you see instead?
the due cards counter will be downloaded indeed, but if you choose &quot;learn&quot;, the congrats
screen pops up immediately although there are due cards.
After some more syncing the deck will even refuse to be opened

Please use labels and text to provide additional information.

This seems to be a problem with the phone itself. These characters do not show up even
in the default web browser. So this may not be a problem of ankidroid. But I have not
been able to understand how to get fonts on my phone that will show correctly without
rooting my phone and voiding my insurance. Please help.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 257 I have general UI suggestions on how to improve the 'edit card' screen.
1- The save button is too small, and too close to cancel. Worse yet, if I use my right
thumb to hit save, I partially cover the area where cancel is. The result is that it's
very easy to hit cancel accidentally. This sucks when I have spent a couple of minutes
writing a very ellaborate card.

2- The 'to' area is tiny too, and hard to hit. There's no reason not to make it bigger.

These two issues are perfect examples of Fitts's law:

The dates for next review should be fixed and with an opaque background, like the buttons.
Also, it should not cover the answer, at least when you scrow down all the way.
I also would like that the font-size for the cards be lowered in cases like this...

My issue is similar to the number 254: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=254

BUT, I never had the problem described in that other issue. I already used v0.4.2 and
0.50alpha8, besides the current alpha 10, and the buttons never went over the cards
in that way, nor they do now.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 267 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start syncing
2. While syncing flip the screen, then flip it back up.
3. Wait until the syncing finishes

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Crash.

The crash happens while trying to return to Study options screen, so it's more likely
related to the latter than to syncing.

It would be nice if touching the AnkiDroid notification would open AnkiDroid. Not necessarily
a deck with many due card, just opening AnkiDroid would be nice already.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 271 The list of shared decks is very big.
Given the slowliness of typing/downloading/processing on mobile devices, and the non-standardized
deck descriptions, I fear that search will not be convenient.

I propose to create target categories, for instance French, Math, Others.
The &quot;Download Deck &gt; Shared deck&quot; button would open the list of categories (downloaded,
or maybe built-in), plus a category &quot;All&quot;.
The Thai category would contain all decks for studying Thai (regardless of the definitions
language).
Those categories would break the huge list into smaller lists that people would be
able to scroll through quickly.
What do you think about it?

I attach the shared decks list as a CSV file, it can be generated with:
wget -O - http://ankiweb.net/file/search | tr -d '[' | tr ']' '\n' | sed -e &quot;s/^, //g&quot;

A first task (non-programmers OK) would be to open this CSV file and affect a category
to each row.
It is very long, so please try 100 by 100 or so, and post the modified CSV files here.
Feedback is important too, let's discuss what are the best possible categories.
We don't have to do the whole list, maybe just the first half (most popular decks)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 272 [Using 0.5alpha11 and 0.5alpha12]

Since a week or so, I often receive the following popup:
&quot;Application AnkiDroid (in process com.ichi2.anki) is not responding.&quot;

This usually happens when I come back to my phone after a few minutes.
I then click &quot;Wait&quot; a few times to let it finish its calculations, and then I can review
as usual.

So what is AnkiDroid calculating so hard?
I am not sure, but it seems that it is checking all decks. The following appears in
the log:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 273 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Start ankidroid, previously selected deck opens automatically
2. Select menu / sync
3. Infos &quot;Connecting...&quot;, &quot;Fetching summary from server&quot; appear consequently. Ankidroid
crashes.
3. The attached log was created by Log Collector.
4. On next start, ankidroid does not automatically create a bug report.
5. When trying to sync again, it is usually possible to get one step farther (i.e.
to Determining differences - then crash. On next sync I got to &quot;transfering payload&quot;
- then crash). Sometimes it even does sync completely.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 274 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I try to sync some of my decks, sometimes it does not sync and just returns what
was there previously
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the deck with updated values for reviews and new cards. It only returns
the values that were previously there for SOME decks. Some sync fine. I can't pinpoint
what the difference in decks is: all my decks are &gt;120 cards and contain pictures.
Really limiting my usage

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
.5alpha8 on Motorola Droid 2.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 275 As a user I would like to be able to see the videos attached in my cards.

Right now, AnkiDroid supports audio and video. Although, video and audio is played
in the same way (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/index.html), we need
to design and implement a good user interface to display the video.

Any ideas on how this user interface could be are very welcomed!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 280 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Download private anki deck
2. load private anki deck
3. compare number of due cards

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It has been normal with ankidroid (for my database with AnkiDroid 0.5 alpha8), that
there is a small difference in due cards from time to time. (like: one or two cards
more on my android phone if I remember correctly) Today I tried the newest release
and I get 712 due cards on ankidroid vs 469 on desktop anki.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid-0.5alpha14-sync-EXPERIMENTAL.apk

Please provide any additional information below.

I did run a full database check on desktop anki (without any negative things found)
and I did try deleting the anki file on my phone and redownloading it. The results
remained the same. Just repeating a few cards on my desktop anki and syncing didn't
change the result either.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 281 Many users will complain if they upgrade to libanki1.1 Anki but do not upgrade AnkiDroid,
and AnkiDroid fails randomly when opening decks.

So my idea is to branch 0.4.2 and just add a single thing: If a deck's version is over
39, then display a message saying:

&quot;To use this deck, you need to upgrade to the new version of AnkiDroid.
We are actively working on this new version, so please check the Market regularly.
It might also be available at http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/downloads/list&quot;

If we are not be able to release libanki-1.1 AnkiDroid at the same time as libanki-1.1
Anki Desktop, that will save us from tons of bad Market comments.

What do you think?

By the way, can anyone try to load a 1.1 deck with AnkiDroid 0.4.2 and let us know
how bad it fails?

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It stays with the status &quot;Updating&quot; until the ankidroid crashes. 

If you click to open this deck, before it crashes in the &quot;open another deck&quot; screen,
it will crash loading the deck, and will do so every time you try to open ankidroid
again. The only way out of it is deleting the deck in ankidroid folder or reinstaling
ankidroid.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid-0.5alpha14-sync-EXPERIMENTAL.apk
Anki 1.0.1 on the desktop.

Now every time I'm running AnkiDroid I'm getting &quot;Deck Could Not Be Loaded&quot; message.
But if I push &quot;Load Other Deck&quot; button and select mydeck it works.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 296 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. AnkiDroid 0.5alpha14, 15, or 16
2. Anki Desktop 1.1.13
3. Sync deck from AnkiDroid to AnkiDesktop. AnkiDesktop to AnkiDroid works fine.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect if I complete cards showing due in 5, 10, 20, XX, days, I will see this reflected
in the desktop version.

Instead, these cards show as complete in the desktop version, but all due in 41.0 years
ago, regardless of their actual due date. See the following screenshot.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid 0.5alpha14, 15, or 16
Anki Desktop 1.1.13

Please provide any additional information below.
Everything seems to be syncing correctly except for this due date issue only when syncing
from Droid to Desktop. The other direction (Desktop to Droid) functions well. 

Prior to this, I was using AnkiDroid alpha8 with Desktop 1.0.1 and working perfectly.
I then upgraded to AnkiDroid alpha14, which upgraded my deck while remaining with Desktop
1.0.1 and began to notice the error. Then, I upgraded to Desktop 1.1.13 hoping to resolve
the error, but still see it. 

Please help, I have been trying to figure out this issue for many many hours! Thank
you!

Maybe someone whose Android knowledge is more proficient than mine, could have a look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 301 The start of personal or shared deck picker needs sometimes a long time (especially
on slow internet connections). So we should make it interruptible. E.g. by pressing
&quot;back&quot;.
For now, a long click on &quot;menu&quot; closes the progress window (but only for opening the
soft keyboard as I reckon), but the process is not terminated: when coming back later
to the deck downloader, AD sticks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 303 I have alpha16 installed on my phone a the moment (although the about screen still says
it's alpha14), but when I try to install alpha17 I get the usual confirmation screen,
but just after the progress bar appears I get the error message &quot;Appplication not installed&quot;.
 I've tried downloading it again and I get the same thing.

I'm using an Orange San Francisco (AKA ZTE Blade) if that makes any difference.

1.Download any of the newer versions
2.Launch Ankidroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I'd expect to see my Staples and be able to study them, instead Ankidroid crashes while
loading an staple. Some versions are crashing right after opening them.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
I've tested any version between alpha8 and 18, none is working. I couldn't even install
alpha17. My Archos 101 Internet Tablet is running Android 2.2.1 (firmware 2.0.71).

Please provide any additional information below.
I've sent an Issue report from Ankidroid yesterday, hope that helps.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 307 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck with gif images (and sounds, in my case)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I only see &quot;blue blocks with an interrogation mark&quot;

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.5 alpha18

Please provide any additional information below.

I have other decks with pictures that work fine, but these have instead jpg files.
I've tried &quot;cleaning&quot; the models of the facts in the desktop version, deleting unnecessary
information, so it could match the ones used in other decks with .jpg pictures, that
work fine. I've also tried to change the directory of AnkiDroid decks. But the issue
persists. Even more, the deck with the problem have also sound files that reproduce
correctly, so I don't think that it has to do with identifing the .media folder (it
does it correctly).
So I think that the problem is in the handling of .gif pictures by the program itself.


Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 312 
Hi,

I upgraded yesterday from version 0.4 alpha8 to 0.5 alpha18, and today to 0.5 beta2.
The first thing I noticed, compared to version 0.5 alpha8, is a huge downgrade in performance
speed of versions 0.5 alpha18 and 0.5 beta2. The deck selection menu takes a huge time
to calculate the cards due to review, and navigation through the screens is very slow,
sometimes even leading to a notification that the program isn't responding and should
be closed.
Surely, everyone with relatively slow hardware like mine (Samsung Gallaxy Spica) should
have similar problems, but I post this issue in case it may help to developpers (thank
you for the hard work!!).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 314 While I was testing the new beta, it crossed my mind that we could implement simple
swipe actions for navigating between the screens.
E.g. on study options: swipe left opens deck picker, swipe right opens reviewer
on deck picker: swipe right returns to study options
on reviewer: swipe left returns to study options

It would make the navigation much more fluent. What do you think?

AnkiDroid beta5, Android 2.2.1.

I've created this staple as an example, but it's happening quite regularely, especially
on very short audio files(but not only).
Anki 1.2.2 is playing them back normal.

It isn't something keeping me from using AnkiDroid in any way, but i thought it might
be better to report it before you update the Market version.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 316 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Reviewing cards
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I still have problems with clicking on show answer. The button is too small or too
close to the bottom. The HTC G2 has a touch back button right at the bottom of the
screen and it becomes a very conscious effort to click the upper part of &quot;Show Answer&quot;
button. This was really not a problem at all in the current market version because
the whiteboard and time were underneath the &quot;Show Answer&quot; button and there was nothing
to worry about.

Can you add an option to move the show answer button up a bit? Or perhaps you could
add the timer and whiteboard button below &quot;show answer&quot; just like in the market version.
This current state makes a person not want to study because it's a burden to watch
out what you press and gives a subconscious weight on studying with Anki.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
beta6 version

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 317 Sometimes a card is shown blank. Pressing on MENU twice refreshes the screen, so it
is not a big issue.
I think it never happens when first displaying cards, it might be linked to switching
applications and the WebView is not redrawn.
It might be an Android 1.5 issue.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 319 Sometimes when only failed cards remain in the total queue, there is a problem in the
building of failed queue:

answer &quot;again&quot; should shift to another position of the queue (mostly at the end) but
instead, the card stays at the top and is immediately shown again. 

This does only (but always) happen with failed card which were mature cards before.
The deck is set not to reset mature card on &quot;again&quot;-button but to multiply the interval
with 10% and delay the next show to the next day (I followed Damien's recommendations
in that regard). 

Another problem: these (former mature) cards are shown always at the end of the queue.
Instead they should be distributed over all cards in total queue.

Cards are set to be shown in random order.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 322 I have recently begun to use a number of shared decks containing foreign language vocabulary.
Where I have spotted mistakes I have found it invaluable to be able to edit the cards.
It would be nice to have a mechanism of feeding this change back to the deck maintainer.

As a very simple resolution, the author of a deck could have the option to tag a deck
with the maintainer's email address. The application could mail back updates on the
user's behalf to be reviewed and incorporated by the maintainer at his discretion.

A more advanced resolution would feature some kind of wiki hosting service which allows
users to post edits back to a centrally hosted repository.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 323 Using AnkiDroid 0.5beta6 on an Archos 28 running Android 2.2.1.

These steps reproduce the problem with the default &quot;country-capitals&quot; deck, as well
as another deck of mine:

1. Sync the deck.
2. Immediately sync the deck again (without reviewing or changing any cards).

Expected behavior: &quot;No changes&quot;.
Actual behavior: &quot;Full sync from local&quot; again.

Thanks to dae in #ankidroid for suggesting that I add the following comments:

&quot;is ankidroid passing v2 to the upload call? is it setting the local sync time based
on the reply from the server?&quot;

&quot;is ankidroid making sure the clock is no more than 5 minutes off?&quot;

(That second comment was after I mentioned that there may be a time-zone issue causing
the last-modified dates on files on my Android device to be 5 hours in the future.)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 325 Hello..

I mentioned it before in another thread, so now in the form of regular feature request
- would it be possible to have manual setting of the user interface language?

There are some reasons - for example the Czech translation for &quot;very easy&quot; makes the
buttons quite larger vertically, which is quite undesirable on my 240x380 display.
:) I can imagine, that there could be other problems in other translations.
The other thing may be, that someone could prefer having Anki in the language they're
studying and such, so I suppose it won't be only &quot;dead feature for three people&quot;..

Anyway, if it is more than few lines of code, I can live without it; it's just an idea
if someone gets bored enough to code it :)

Thanks,
Martin

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 329 Using AnkiDroid 0.5beta11 on an Archos 28 running Android 2.2.1.

Currently, touching the menu button while in the deck-picker screen does not bring
up a menu. To do certain actions, even certain actions that are not specific to a particular
deck, the user must go into a deck (bringing up the Study Options screen for a deck)
and then touch the menu button.

I think it would be nice to have a menu appear when the menu button is pressed from
the deck-picker screen, containing the following choices:

&quot;Sync all&quot; (currently already available as a button)
&quot;Download deck&quot;
&quot;Study options&quot;
&quot;More&quot; (leading to Preferences, My Account, and About)

(Alternatively, &quot;Preferences&quot;, &quot;My Account&quot;, and &quot;About&quot; could be in the menu itself,
instead of gathered behind &quot;More&quot;.)

I think this would match better with the Anki desktop client, where most of the above
actions are accessible from the deck-picker screen without the need to open a deck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 330 Here is how long it takes me to add a new fact in 0.5beta.11

- 22secs to go back from review screen to main screen
- 30secs to save the new fact, with just two fields
- 30secs to reload the deck

That's nearly 1.5 minutes in total.

In the snapshot posted to issue 16, there was not such a big delay in the first step,
and as the deck was not reloaded after every addition, the third delay was absent.
It was still frustratingly slow, and is now more or less unusable.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 331 My deck is fairly large with ~10,000 facts. When anki loads the deck, or even just shows
it in the list there is a 30 second delay. This is slow, but might be tolerable if
it only happened once when the deck is loaded. Instead, this delay occurs:

- when the deck is listed in your available deck list
- when the deck is opened
- when a new card is added

If it is the stats that is causing the problem, do we really need to show them for
the available decks? Shouldn't they be cached in the database? and is it necessary
to reload the database every time a card is added?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 333 Using AnkiDroid 0.5beta11 on an Archos 28 running Android 2.2.1.

Currently the double-tap gesture (to answer a card with one ease above recommendation)
is enabled even when the other gestures are disabled (by Preferences &gt; Swipe).

I would like to see the double-tap gesture disabled when Swipe is disabled.

If this is done, perhaps the Swipe preference should be renamed to &quot;Enable gestures&quot;
to make it more general. Then the summary text in the preference screen could be something
like: &quot;Swipe horizontally to switch between screens and vertically to answer cards
(down: again, up: recommendation, double-tap: easier than recommendation)&quot;

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 337 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. review a deck
2. As you go through and review cards, watch the three numbers at the top (# Failed
in red, # Reviews in black and # New in blue)
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output is that AnkiDroid will underline the appropriate number depending on
whether the current card is a Failed, Review, or New card.
Instead, I sometimes see that none of the three are underlined.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Noticed this with .5beta5, still occurs on .5beta10
Using Android 2.2.1

Please provide any additional information below.
It seems that it goes in streaks - i.e.: several are underlined as expected in a row,
then several in a row have none of the three underlined.

After a crash, AnkiDroid offers to send an error report. I push the button to send
the report, but I get &quot;No applications can perform this action.&quot;

I'm not familiar with how the error reports are sent. Is it by email? I don't have
email set up on this device.

If AnkiDroid were to save the error report in a file, I'd be happy to manually send
that file to whoever needed to see it.

2. Download the deck to ankidroid and open it.
2. Review a card model = &quot;sentences&quot;, template = &quot;forward&quot;.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: White text on a black background
Actual: White text on a white background

the &quot;reverse&quot; template is black text on a white background and that works fine.

In anki on my PC it works - all cards appear correctly and i can edit them (both anki
1.0 and 1.X). in ankidroid 0.5 alpha 8 it worked fine.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Ankidroid 0.5 beta 10
Anki 1.2.3

1.If there was a way to delete the decks that would be great, i accidentally touch
the wrong deck, boom on my phone and cannot remove it.

2.It would also be great if we could search the shared decks or if they are alphabetical
order

3. if there is a way to do this please send me an email rickcopithorne@gmail.com

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 342 Currently using AnkiDroid 0.5beta12 on an Archos 28 running Android 2.2.1; over the
past few days I've been using the various beta versions as they are released.

I've had AnkiDroid crash a few times, and when I tried to send an error report, I got
the message &quot;No applications can perform this action.&quot; This may be because I did not
have an email account set up on my Android device: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=338

I'd like to see AnkiDroid offer to save the error report as a file, which I could later
retrieve from my Android device's storage and manually send to the developers (e.g.
from my desktop machine), without the need to have an email account set up on the Android
device.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 346 Please consider adding a feature to &quot;Bury&quot; cards.  This is a feature in the Desktop
version that allows one to suspend a card solely until the next session.

I don't imagine it would be used very much, but it would be helpful in certain cases.
 Really, it could be buried a bit in the menu and not as prominent as Undo/Mark/Suspend.
 Perhaps we could add a option to automatically &quot;Mark&quot; buried cards as well in case
the user wants to remember which cards he buried to edit later. 

Here's a possible application:
Some of my cards have unicode characters that cannot yet display in
Android (unrooted).  Since these characters are part of the answer, I
cannot study them on my phone.  They only make up 1/10 of my deck
however, so it would be nice to bury them until I do the deck on my
computer later.

I imagine there are other uses for it to such as an image/audio file not loading properly.

One concern might be that AnkiDroid seems to open all the decks in the deck browser
to check how many due cards there are.  At least, they are modified according to my
SyncToy software.  So this might cancel the Bury feature out.  Somehow, AnkiDesktop
can check Cards Due without opening/modifying the decks.

Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 356 Will try make this make sense.

1. I do a bit of studying, and have a few failed cards, e.g. 8
2. I press the back button on my phone to go back to the study options screen to stop
the timer.
3. I return later in the day to study, and the first cards to come up are the failed
cards
4. If I get a failed card wrong, the failed count goes down by one, even though it
should stay the same.
5. If I then get review cards or new cards wrong, the failed count does not change
6. If I go back to the Study Options screen and back in, the failed count will be correct
again

This doesn't happen all the time, but enough times that I have noticed.


I'm using Beta 15, and I am using a HTC Desire running Froyo. 

Hope that makes sense! If you need me to clarify anything let me know

Cheers,
Scotty

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 360 Using AnkiDroid v0.5beta17 on an Archos 28 with firmware 2.1.3 and Android 2.2.1.

I don't know whether this is something that can be changed in AnkiDroid, or something
inherent to the way Android draws UI buttons:

See attached screenshots. When I answer a card by pushing one of the four onscreen
buttons (Again, Good, Easy, Very Easy), the other three buttons are momentarily grayed
out just before AnkiDroid shows the next card. I initially found this confusing, and
I still find it distracting, because the &quot;flat&quot; appearance of the grayed-out buttons,
as compared to their normal &quot;convex&quot; appearance, looks like they have been &quot;pushed&quot;.
The button I push turns orange while I'm pushing it, but since my finger blocks my
view of that orange button, I mostly notice one or more of the adjacent buttons going
to &quot;flat gray&quot;, which initially confused me into thinking I had pushed the wrong button.

So, if possible, I'd like all the buttons to retain their &quot;convex&quot; appearance, rather
than going to &quot;flat gray&quot;.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 361 I just had the following issue:

I started syncing and half way through I received a phonecall.
After the phonecall I returned to AnkiDroid and found it stuck at &quot;Transferring payload...&quot;

A check at ankiweb.net reveals that the payload wasn't sent.

The log was stuck at:
...
I/AnkiDroid(22505):     ---youngEase2 = 140
I/AnkiDroid(22505):     ---youngEase3 = 4
I/AnkiDroid(22505):     ---youngEase4 = 36
I/AnkiDroid(22505): applyPayload
I/AnkiDroid(22505): onSaveInstanceState: /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/country-capitals.anki
I/AnkiDroid(22505): onSaveInstanceState - Ending

I'm not sure how to handle this interruption. Obviously the UI is able to resume, but
it will be hard to resume the Connection procedure from where it stopped. What happens
to the Connection thread in such a case anyway?

It's probably safer to just inform the user that the syncing was interrupted and have
a Retry and a Cancel button.

Obviously this is low priority, because it's rare to happen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 366 Syncing always reports uploaded facts but the count is build by the number of uploaded
cards.

I just edited one fact of a two-cardmodels-model. As a consequence, both cards are
updated. When I synced directly afterwards, the sync protocol said: &quot;uploaded two facts&quot;
instead of &quot;uploaded two cards&quot; because only one fact was changed but two cards.

I think it's not necessary to give a result of both changes as anki desktop does. It
should be enough just to let the result be &quot;uploaded x cards&quot;.

What do you think?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 374 Anki 1.2.5 (rpm bodhi--fedora update--testing)

Hello Damien, I am testing 1.2.5 Anki package on Fedora.  The message &quot;Session Limit
Reached&quot; pops-up randomly but frequently not matter the deck I use (they are all testing
decks with 5 to 10 cards only).

I have seen a bug trace marked as fixed URL http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=42

In my case, the message pops-up during editing, reviewing, template editing, etc. 
not only after reviewing cards.

Do I contact the Fedora maintainer about the package, or is it software related.  Thanks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 375 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Launch AnkiDroid
2. Get shared deck
3. Choose any deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected to see a card, instead I only see {{{Front}}} as question and {{{Back}}} as
answer.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid 0.4.2, Android 2.2

Please provide any additional information below.
Tried with many additional desks, none works.
When choosing the &quot;Edit card&quot; option, I can see the right values within the textboxes.
The country-capitals deck works properly

I thought we were safe from this, because we compiled with minSDKVersion 1.5, but...
apparently it does happen.

I'll have to add a workaround, as this can trigger at upgrading deck, which makes unable
to use AnkiDroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 385 I just tried installing AnkiDroid on a friend's phone, and the sample deck does not

We should ship AnkiDroid with a compatible sample deck.
This might force us to release a 0.5.1 in a few hours.
Can anyone confirm?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 386 At first, newcomers see the &quot;No deck found&quot; dialog, it kinds of blames them.

I think we can find a way to rephrase this screen in a more welcoming way, and make
the &quot;Load sample deck&quot; more prominent, together with an very short explanation of the
deck's goal, and maybe a very short explanation of the buttons, if there is enough
room left.

https://github.com/nobnago/Anki-Android/commit/fde5066033d98807d4c39bccd0988b504d59ae37

I added a card browser to AnkiDroid. 

As for now, there is
a) a search field at the top allows filtering of the list and
b) a tap on a card opens the card editor. 

I'm now thinking about which functions are as well useful to be implemented.

A longclick could maybe open a context menu with
a) delete card
b) suspend/unsuspend card

the general menu should contain
a) possibility of changing the display order
b) undo/redo
c) filtering by tag

If you have any other suggestions, feel free to give them voice...

Cheers

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 413 When answers are shown, the cards faces are not stacked (question
on top, answer on the bottom). Instead, it will place the answer next
to the question, which messes up the display of course. My templates
use div and span tags and use css to format those tags. 

My guess is that anki does some post processing of HTML or when the sound icon is inserted
or something that messes up the HTML in a way normal anki does not.


Attached is a deck that reproduces the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 414 If a user wants to download a shared deck from the deck picker, she has to open a deck
first. Why not have the &quot;Download deck&quot; menu item in the deck picker screen rather
than in the study options screen?

Similarly, some other choices might be questionable.
Let's brainstorm here about the menu organization, focusing on intuitiveness for new
users.
If an agreement is reached, it will ship in AnkiDroid 0.6 which is quite soon.

Because there are still some performance problems which can be alleviated with a db

(it will need some time) but maybe on demand through the context menu in deckpicker.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 418 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Having a long text that is read by the TTS system and then changing card while the
system is reading
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the reading to end and the reading of the new card text to start.
Instead it crashes.



What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

0.6alpha2
Please provide any additional information below.
The above description is just my assumption of what I did before the crashes.
I am not sure of how to create the symptom and I might be mistaken but I thought I
would report it anyway. It is somewhat nondeterministic.
I use SVOX classic TTS

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 421 I tried it now several times, always the same:

1. Synced a deck which was changed on both sides, chose &quot;local&quot; on question on which
version should be kept.

2. Synced from Anki Desktop. It always says: no changes found

3. Deleted deck in Anki Desktop, downloaded synced deck anew: deck equals now the deck
on AnkiDroid

in a nutshell: Total sync works, but there must be a problem with the timestamp since
Anki does not recognise a new version.

Cheers!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 428 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. On Ankidroid (i think 0.5.1, how can is see which version I have installed?) I choose
&quot;sync all&quot; in the deck selection screen.

2. One of my two decks synchronises, the other one returns: &quot;Error: Deck has not been
synchronised.&quot;

I had synced the deck in question before, so I have no idea, why all of a sudden i
get this error.
Can I check a log file somewhere?

I did some days of study, but now I need to add more facts to the deck, using Anki
1.2.5 on my PC.
I hope there is a way to solve this without loosing my study logs.

As I said, I think I use Ankidroid 0.5.1 (again, how to find out?)
I have a Nexus S with stock Gingerbread 2.3.2

Selecting &quot;Again&quot; and editing cards leads to frequent crashes of Ankidroid on my phone
(HTC desire, Android 2.2). There was no crash for other answeres. It only crashes when
I select &quot;Again&quot; or try to edit a card.

The problem exists since I changed from Ankidroid 4.2 to Ankidroid 5.1.
I am considering to change back to 4.2. Anyone else with similar problems?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 434 (I'm not sure what causes the problem. However I'm opening the issue to see if others
are having the same problem and I'll update it as I learn more.)

I have 3 decks and I've had the problem on two of them (one is only 25 facts so it's
not a size problem). I go to the available decks screen and the number of cards to
test fails to calculate for one of the decks. I can wait ten minutes and it never finishes.
If I click on the deck I get an 'unable to load deck' screen. Opening the deck in anki
(version 1.2.7 I believe) and saving it solves the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 435 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. It happens randomly but I'm on the deck list.
2. I choose a deck.
3. I get a new available decks list (I say new because all the stats start to calculate
again)
4. Selecting a deck from this screen results in an 'unable to load deck' page.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Ankidroid .5.1
Anki 1.2.6

Please provide any additional information below.
I can quit and restart ankidroid and that usually solves the problem.

1. After typing in a search word into the Shared Deck download screen, and then clicking
on a deck to download, all shared deck reappear, despite the search word remaining
in the search box. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Normally I would expect the decks shown to be limited to the search word, instead I
have to change the search term by a single character to get the desired search to show.
This can be quite tedious if you are downloading multiple shared decks.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

AnkiDroid 0.6alpha3, on Froyo, on a HTC Desire.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 440 In normal mode everything looks alright (black text, white background). But in nightly
mode (nachtmodus) both text and background are white and the text is therefore not

Fix probably includes forcing background color of question/answer fields to black too,
if nightly mode is selected. Header (numbers/time) and bottom (buttons) already have
a black background.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 441 Hi all,

I have a HTC Legend and Ankidroid seems to work quite well therefore  bought my mother
a motorola milestone (german Droid, similar but not the same). She uses anki online
like I do.

So I installed 0.5.1 and tried to log in with her account for setting up syncing but
it does not work. When i try to log in there comes &quot;an network error occured&quot; / &quot;Es
ist ein Netzwerkfehler auftreten&quot; and I cannot log in. Usually she only uses WLAN and
youtube / Mail / Browser all work quite well, only ankidroid does not work. But I activated
mobile Internet (APN, UMTS) as well and it does not change anything. 
Even those steps did not work:
- trying 0.6 Beta3
- using my account instead of my mothers

Suprisingly, I can download public decks, but NOT personal decks. Unfortunately I cannot
test it with custom ROMs because the Milestone has a locked bootloader, therefore u
cannot change the OS.

What am I supposed to do? I have really no idea. FW Version is 2.1 Update-1

Thanks

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 445 What steps will reproduce the problem?

It seems random, and happens only with one card each day.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

A due card, when answered correctly, should not appear until the next days. However,
sometimes a card will appear constantly even if it's aswered correctly several times.
It's reappearance follows a pattern of once each two cards, i.e. the card reappears,
then another due card, then another time the &quot;cursed&quot; card. The due counter seems to
work correctly, so in fact, the card that keeps appearing is substituing other due
cards. This leads to a crash when the due counter is reduced to 0, and when ankidroid
restarts, another bunch of due cards appears (surely, these must be the due cards that
the &quot;cursed&quot; card substituted before the crash). I've doublechecked in the card browser
that this isn't a problem of duplicated cards in the deck. 

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

I'm currently using 0.6 alpha 0.4 on Android 2.2, but in fact, this problem happens
at least since 0.6 alpha 0.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 446 I try to figure what describes the different colours in the progress bars of the deck
selection menu. I can understant easily that the grey colour describes the percentage
of new reviewed cards (i.e. the deck completion percentage). But what represents the
white bar? It could be explained somewhere. At present, with so many new functions,
it would be useful to have a &quot;help&quot; section in the program.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 447 &gt; At present, with so many new functions, it would be useful to have a &quot;help&quot; section

&gt; in the program

Since we have a lot of new functions, users should be able to learn about them easily.
We would need screenshots and explanations for that. The latter should contain a short
description of RSR and a link to anki for further information).

I see two possibilities:

a) add a webview activity which contains small screenshots and some explanations (which
should be in different strings in order to be able to extend them easily).
b) create a button or maybe better clickable prominent coloured textview which opens
a browser with a wiki page, containing the explanations. 

What do you think?

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 449 
Today NorbertNagold kindly answered me about what represents the white part of the
progress bars. Well, at the beggining I figured out this by myself, but something caused
to me some confusion: two of my longest-rewied decks showed a white bar that occupied
less of 10% of the total space of the bar, while the grey bar showed correctly nearly-completed.
I checked the stat graphs, of cumulative due cards in 1 year, and they showed the information
that should be represented by the white bar: almost 80% of the cards are mature, not
merely a 10%.

So the first question that I have made to myself is: what makes different these decks
from the others? I came easily to the answer: they are only small parts, activated
by tags, of much larger decks, much of them disabled by tags. 
So, while the grey bar is based on the degree of completion of the tag-activated cards,
I suspect that the white bar is showing information based on the whole deck, tag-activated
or tag-suspended. I find this confusing, since the overlapping of the bars (white and
grey) would rather suggest that the two draw information on the same basis, but I find
they doesn't.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 450 Hi

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. create deck with jpg on back (like copy pasted a lecture slide)
2. Sync with dropbox
3. Try to learn on mobile device(htc desire 2.1)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The question ist right, the answer (back) is blank or a image of a very small square
meaning a picture is missing.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
ankidroid 0.51 (latest), android (1 before gingerbread) without root

Please provide any additional information below.

After I choose dropbox sync in settings I need to input the adresse of the dropbox
folder which was created automatically. But it says the chosen folder is not public
(but it is truly the public folder!) These confused me, which is the correct path?
like c:/programms/dropbox/public/anki/mydeck ?

Is it just my problem or is this function not yet integrated?

Thanks for your answer

Is that true? (Is the recommendation always &quot;Good&quot;?)

If so, perhaps the swipe description (&quot;Swipe horizontally to switch between screens...&quot;)

&quot;easier than rec.&quot;.

I just started using this version and I love the time remaining estimate. However,

Also seems to take a lot longer moving from the card review mode back to the deck information

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 458 Well, I know that TTS is a new feature, already &quot;a child&quot;, but here's some suggestions
for enhance it's usability in the future:

1. Choosing which fields should be read with TTS. Actually, there's only the option
of choosing the language for TTS in each field, but there isn't any option of &quot;discarding&quot;
TTS for one field.
2. Well, point 1 isn't totally true, since the &quot;back&quot; button can be pressed to discard
TTS only for the present field. The problem is that this action isn't recorded for
the rest of the session, and if we want one field without TTS, we must press &quot;back&quot;
each time TTS attempts to read this field.
3. The option to activate TTS per deck. Some users have decks which they want to use
TTS, and some they don't want.

So, in short: 
1. A button of &quot;discard&quot; in the emerging menu of TTS language selection.
2. Recording of &quot;discard&quot; selection for the rest of the session.
3. Activate/deactivate TTS per deck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 460 Should we remove the &quot;Preferences&quot; menu item from Study Options?

Pro:
Preferences are not related to a particular deck, so it belongs to the deck picker.

Con:
Changing a preferences while reviewing would take a long time. (We could even add the
preferences menu item to the Review screen)

I have no strong opinion, waiting for your feedback.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 461 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck with several card models.
2. Add content from the desktop version using the automatic card creation check boxes
in the upper right hand side to create multiple cards of the same fact (in this way
they should be created in order).
3. Synchronize to ankidroid.
4. Enable the 'Study Option', 'Review cards in random order'.
5. Proceed to review cards.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect to see cards in random order, i.e. cards of the same 'fact' should not follow
each other, except in highly rare cases.

Actual result is that all the cards of each particular 'fact' are shown in sequence.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
.06a6
Xperia running 2.2

Please provide any additional information below.
On the desktop version, using the same option, the cards are displayed randomly.
Note I have created other decks to test this problem.
Should be able to reproduce it with the attached deck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 462 In the deck picker, why are &quot;statistics&quot; and &quot;sync all&quot; buttons rather than menu items?
I am thinking about making them menu items, if there is no reason not to.

I think most students learn at many different classes, so they might have a long list
of decks. Personally I don't study much but already have a dozen personal decks, so
it is important to view more / scroll without accidental button press.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 469 since a few days (two or three). I've experienced a very bad slowdown of AnkiDroid.
It needs sometimes four or more seconds for a card to load.

I traced it back to this routine this line in Deck.java:

cur = getDB().getDatabase().rawQuery(&quot;SELECT value FROM deckVars WHERE key = '&quot; + key
+ &quot;'&quot;, null);

which is called by updateCard --&gt; baseUrl = Utils.getBaseUrl(mMediaDir, myModel, currentDeck);
--&gt; if (deck.getBool(&quot;remoteImages&quot;)...

This rawQuery takes sometimes more thant four seconds to execute. the variable &quot;remoteImages&quot;
does not exist in the deck-db and it seems as if sqlite needs very long to learn that.
My db knowledge is poor, so I don't want to muck this about. Is this an index problem
maybe and how can we solve it?

To my mind we should store the value anyway in a deck variable instead of performing
always a db-operation for this value (which should be always the same).


It was probably introduced with the new fetch-images-code.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 471 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open AnkiDroid (mine defaults to Deck Picker)
2. Select a Deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect the deck to open for review
Sometimes, the deck does not open.  In the case for which the Log Collector log is
attached, the first time I selected a deck, I was dumped back to the Deck Picker after
a few seconds.  I then reselected the same deck, and was taken to a screen that indicated
it was an invalid deck, and to select a different deck.  I then reselected the same
deck again, and it opened normally.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
v0.5.1 from market on Android 2.2.1 on Motorola Droid

Please provide any additional information below.
- This does not occur all the time - it seems to occur more frequently when many cards
are due in more than one of my several decks - ie: after I skipped reviews for a day
or two.
- I don't recall it ever failing more than 3 times in a row.
- this was discussed briefly at https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=331

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 476 Well, tell me if i'm wrong, but I think that currently, while it can be created a card
or a card model with a single sound as question, without any text, it cannot be said
the same about TTS, which needs a text to be read in the same field.

It would be a huge improvement finding a way to implement TTS in the question that
reads text of the answer, for training listening abilities.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 478 Hi,

Nicolas Raoul asked me to create an issue for what i wrote here: http://groups.google.com/group/anki-android/browse_frm/thread/36060f0a3204fad6

I'd be great to have a pure training mode in which i can browse through my cards back
and forth (by button and/or gesture) in the same way as in review mode. But with these
differences:

- question and answer are visible at once (because it's training/learning) mode
- the review buttons are not shown, only prev/next button for browsing through the
cards

I'm currently missing such a learning/training mode because in review mode i always
feel like in a test situation and that prevents me from learning in a relaxed way.



Thx for Ankidroid and keep up the good work.

Stefan

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 482 Feature wish:
Considering that I've already lost some decks with one of the recent alpha versions,
it would be a nice feature for Ankidroid to automatically save a copy of a deck before
it is synched or (only if it doesn't take up too much performance) to make backup copies
of each deck everytime after a reviewing session.

Ankidesktop has a setting where you can choose how many backups you want to keep.

A feature like that would maybe encourage more people to try out the latest alphas
as than they know there's less risk of losing reviews :)

Cheers,
Marcel

Sounds should be reproduced when pressing the sound buttons. Instead, nothing happens.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 495 Hello,

Would it be possible to change the behavior of the deck picker so that it merely reads
the decks and doesn't modify them?

I use sync-software to move my decks back and forth*.  Anki Desktop somehow procures
the Cards Due information without modifying the decks, but Ankidroid seems to change
them in some way. So my sync software pretty much always thinks that the Ankidroid
decks are all more recent, even the decks I never edited.

This is a minor issue of course.  If it's an easy fix however, I would appreciate it.

____________
* Some of my decks are pretty big and I'm waiting until the sync feature of Ankidroid
is no longer experimental.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 496 Seems that the process of updating is badly implemented, since it causes random crashes,
freezes and general drop in performance (due cards calculation takes forever) when
consulting or switching to deck picker. Happened the same in a Samsung Gallaxy Spica
on previous builds, but I own now a pretty high-end HTC Desire HD.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 498 Fixing of issue 464 has created a new problem:

Now it happens the opposite problem in deck picker screen, at least with Spanish version:
now &quot;Cards due&quot; and &quot;New today&quot; entries tend to overlap if there's a large amount of
cards due. Maybe it could be found a solution that, while making the space variable
like now, also introduces a minimum spacing between &quot;Cards due&quot; and &quot;New today&quot; texts,
and if this space is exceeded, taking then (and only then) a second line for presenting
information.

If you click &quot;Remove card&quot;, it will reveal a sub-menu:
- Suspend card
- Delete card
- Bury card

Maybe we should find a better term than &quot;Remove card&quot;, which sounds
like it will delete the card.

TODO:
1) Replace &quot;Remove card&quot; (for instance: &quot;Dismiss...&quot;)
2) Replace the X icon, some ideas:
 - arrow pointing out of a circle similar to row 2 column 4 here:
http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/11787913/2/istockphoto_11787913-arrow-signs-icon-set-v-fresh-reflection.jpg
 - arrow pointing out of a deck of cards similar to:

 - existing &quot;X&quot; icon but with addition of &quot;...&quot; to icon to indicate
more options before real edits made
 - &quot;X&quot; icon with gear similar to http://www.insofta.com/stock-icons/aero-icons/preview/options-delete.png
I don't know the licensing terms on these...was just looking for quick
samples...

We are in code-freeze but this is just text/icon change so I would deem it acceptable.

On the &quot;Welcome to AnkiDroid&quot; screen (displayed on the first run after installing AnkiDroid),
the buttons currently appear in the following order:

&quot;Load Other Deck&quot;
&quot;Download deck&quot;
&quot;Load Sample Deck&quot;

Having the &quot;Load Other Deck&quot; button come first makes sense in the context of the &quot;Deck
Could Not Be Loaded&quot; screen, but in the context of the Welcome screen, it doesn't make
sense: &quot;other&quot; than what?

So I propose that the buttons on the Welcome screen should be rearranged into the following
order:

&quot;Load Sample Deck&quot;
&quot;Load Other Deck&quot;
&quot;Download deck&quot;

If I want to view the About screen, I have to first choose &quot;Open Deck&quot;, which doesn't

So how about adding an &quot;About&quot; item to the deck-summary menu, so the user can view

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 507 Using 0.6beta4.

When I'm in the deck-summary screen for a deck, and I want to:
switch to a different local deck,
download a deck,
create a deck,
sync all my decks,
view the About screen,
view statistics for all decks,
I have to choose &quot;Open Deck&quot; from the menu.

For some of those tasks, &quot;Open Deck&quot; doesn't seem like an intuitive menu choice. Perhaps
that menu item could be renamed. Here are some of my ideas:

&quot;Close Deck&quot; (Since we're closing the current deck. Anki Desktop 1.2.7 calls it &quot;Close&quot;.)

&quot;Other Decks&quot; (this encompasses other functions of the deck-picker that don't necessarily
involve actually opening a deck, such as downloading and syncing)

&quot;Main Screen&quot; (Even when the Startup Mode is configured so that AnkiDroid starts on
the study-options screen instead of the deck-picker, I still think of the deck-picker
as a kind of &quot;Main Menu&quot; or &quot;Home Screen&quot; for AnkiDroid.)

&quot;Deck-Picker&quot; (That's what the developers already call it anyway)

&quot;Deck List&quot;

At various, non-repeatable times, the following message appears: &quot;Sorry!   Application
AnkiDroid (in process com.ichi2.anki) is not responding.&quot;  The user is given two choices:
&quot;Force Close&quot; or &quot;Wait&quot;.  I usually pick wait, and AnkiDroid does usually come back
without crashing.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid .6beta 3 on Android 2.2.1 on Motorola Droid.  This seems to happen much more
frequently with .6beta3 than with .6alpha9 and previous versions

Please provide any additional information below.
I have attached two log files from two slightly different situations:
1) Phone was on, but display was off.  I placed the phone in the dock, and the display
automatically comes on.  The error message above was displayed at around 3:32pm.
2) Phone was on, but display was off.  I turned on and unlocked the display.  The error
message above was displayed around 5:05pm)

I think that I have seen this message on scenarios other than when the display is just
turning on, but I don't have a log file.  I'll load .6beta6 now, and submit a log file
for other circumstances if they occur.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 518 Two related thoughts here:

1) Currently, when the phone is power cycled, the Widget does not display info (just
says &quot;&quot;) until at least one deck has been reviewed.  Is it possible to load info prior
to first reviews?  or does the AnkDroid app actually need to run to feed the data to
the widget?

2) The info in the Widget is updated at some interval.  I don't know how often, but
likely selected to keep reasonably recent info and minimize batter drain.  As far as
I can tell, the Widget is not updated after a session of reviewing cards in AnkiDroid.
 Without knowing exactly when the Widget does update or the trade-offs for updating
more frequently, I would suggest that it at least be updated whenever the user is actively
using AnkiDroid - e.g. at the end of the session.  So they have current info as to
what has changed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 519 Probably due to high memory usage, the card browser fails loading some huge decks on
some old devices.
In those cases, we show an error message: &quot;Error on loading cards. This is probably
related to your device\'s memory restrictions. Try again with a smaller deck&quot;.

It is a rare issue, but if we were to seek perfection, ideally we could do some paging,
to not load all cards together. That would allow all decks to be browsed on all devices.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 520 Some cards with great amounts of text take too much space in card browser, and turn
the browser almost illegible. Maybe it would be better a truncated presentation, like
in desktop version, with a &quot;...&quot; punctuation mark truncating the preview once it reaches
a fixed amount of space.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 523 Enhancement: Add &quot;By date created&quot; as a choice in the &quot;Choose Display Order&quot; dialog
in the Card Browser

The Card Browser feature was recently added to AnkiDroid.  There are currently 5 options
on how to sort the cards in the browser.  I propose an additional option to sort by
date the card was created.

&quot;Created&quot; is the default sort order in the desktop Anki.  It is appropriate for users
to add material as they progress through offline lesson material.  It is also appropriate
and logical to view the cards the way you remember to enter them.

It may also make sense to add other options that exist in the desktop version...but
I think by &quot;Created&quot; is the most important.
It may also seem natural for users if this became the default on AnkiDroid, as it is
the default on the desktop Anki.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 525 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Be in the deck-picker (&quot;All decks&quot;) screen
2. Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; General
3. Toggle &quot;Sync features&quot; checkbox
4. Push Back button twice to return to deck-picker

What is the expected output?
If I've just enabled/disabled Sync, I would expect to see the Sync button appear/disappear
when I return from Preferences to the deck-picker.

What do you see instead?
Sync button doesn't appear/disappear until I force the deck-picker screen to refresh,
for example by opening and then closing a deck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 528 comment from damien:
You might want to check what the performance hit of this kind of undo support is. Especially
given the speed troubles you have on some Android installs, you might want a cheaper
approach like saving the last card in memory so you can undo the repetition.

Saving undo information to db is indeed very slow. Because it needs a committodb, it
doubles sometimes the answering time. Furthermore, on opening the db, a temporary table
is created and some triggers inserted. This needs as well some time. 

So moving the information into memory would definitely better ad's performance.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 529 What steps will reproduce the problem?
[---]
None... just did some cards yesterday and the ones that are supposed to show today
didn't show up. 
The choices I made were Hard, on all 5 new cards. They were supposed to show up today
(per day scheduling). Is this a problem in the intervals? Would the spacing need to
be longer, on my deck, for it to work properly? Currently, The deck from my computer
has the initial intervals of 1-2days (button2), 4-7days (button3), 12-21days(button4).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
[---]
AnkiDroid_ver: 0.6beta7
Android_ver: 2.2.1
Internet access: None, currently


Please provide any additional information below.
[---]
The desktop app has the ability to auto-select (spacebar) choice of hard and good.
This depends on how when a card has been shown. First time, one is shown, it auto selects
hard. Second time or more, it will choose good until one feels like choosing very easy(?).
This would be a highly recommended feature... as I don't select the choices. I let
the program choose based on that.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 530 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open up AnkiDroid, even after clearing the memory.

Expected to go straight to the Deckpicker. Instead, it opens up to a blank black screen
that says &quot;Feedback&quot; at the top.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

Using the most recent Beta (6.7?) and Android...I'm not sure how to check. Oh! Firmware
2.1-update1.

Please provide any additional information below.

What happens, is I hit back and it takes me to whatever deck I last used (even if it
was hours ago). After that, I have to hit &quot;menu&quot; &quot;all decks&quot; in order to get back to
my deckpicker.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 535 A recent market comment says that the deck picker should be made to &quot;load much faster&quot;.

I agree that the deck picker somehow feels slow to operate.
Getting the list of &quot;*.anki&quot; files from the decks directory takes nearly no time, so
why?

Is there anything to improve with threading when statistics are calculated?
How can we make people understand that the picker is already fully loaded and they
can pick a deck immediately? (I suspect some people wait until nothing is spinning
anymore before selecting a deck) Maybe by not showing any spinning at all?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 543 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. copy deck from android to desktop
2. Sync or full sync on the desktop as necessary
3. Copy the deck back to the android
4. synch on the android - no changes will be found. It seems like a successful synch.
5. Do a few cards on the android and then synch the deck again (on android)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expecting a few cards to synch with the server
Instead I am told that the deck has changed both locally and remotely - which do I
want to keep?

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Beta9, 2.2

Please provide any additional information below.
If I choose to keep the local deck, a full synch will occur and  (so far) the problem
will not recur. But when my decks initially got out of synch, probably by making changes
in both places, I wanted to avoid doing a full synch on the phone with a largish deck,
to conserve out internet quota. This happened with all my decks and was a problem prior
to beta9.

for the failed (red) and from then on it seems OK. In this particular deck I have no
new cards (blue).

So when I review the cards the number look like: 0 18 0 
when it should look like: 0 _18_ 0

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 547 This happens on 0.6 beta 9 as well as 0.5

I'm not sure how to reproduce this, it's random and I only usually notice a few days
after it happens. Usually there is no deck corruption.

I sync my deck on my phone normally after I finish all my reviews. Every few days I
sync it with the Anki desktop client. Sometimes after I sync on the desktop client,
I have an entire sync worth of cards that I've already answered in AnkiDroid, appearing
as due reviews in the desktop client. So the situation is that I have 0 cards due in
AnkiDroid and there is nothing to sync, and on the desktop client I have 20 (or whatever)
cards due and also nothing to sync. So one of the syncs from AnkiDroid didn't work.
The only way to fix it is to copy the deck from the sdcard over, answering the cards
again in the desktop client and syncing with AnkiDroid sometimes does corrupt the deck.

My guess would be that Anki server is not committing the changes, and AnkiDroid is
not handling the failed response properly/receiving a response and committing instead
of rolling back. The only thing I can think of that may cause this is when I sync I
sometimes have a rubbish signal, and my phone locks before the sync finishes. I may
then only unlock my phone a couple of hours later, so exactly what Android does with
this task, whether it tries to pause it or kill it, that may be the cause.

Hello.  It may sound strange - a gamepad and ankidroid put together,
but I've been using zeemote with another SRS software on my WinMo
phone for some time now and it is just perfect when you want to review
while exercising on a treadmill or simply lying on your back with your
phone in a car mount over your head (ergonomics, yeah).   I even had
some audio-only decks for my outdoor runs.

I am new to Android in general and even more so to Android development
(making my progress though, I hope), but maybe someone out there would
like to pick this up?  I would be happy to buy you guys a zeemote or
two if you promise to give it a try.  The zeemote SDK is freely
available, well documented with samples.

The idea would be to map the main (fire) button to &quot;Good&quot;, some other
buttons to &quot;Again&quot;, and so on, and one remaining button to invoke a
small on-screen menu navigated with the analog stick for carrying
additional actions.  Ideally, each activity could be made zeemote-
aware (for browsing decks, etc), but for starters - remote controlling
reviews is more than enough.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 549 I'm using (the latest) Anki on my computer and AnkiDroid (v0.5.1) on my HTC Desire,
Android 2.2; I'm learning Chinese with it and add new cards every other day when we
learn them in class. I do this by synchronizing from my phone, then the computer, adding
words there, and synchronizing again. All works fine. I do Anki only on my phone, not
on the computer (anymore), as I find it more convienient. I checked the option, that
the amount of cards doesn't change over the day, so it doesn't get more over the day,
but only on the day-day border. Know what I mean?

BUT... Every day some of the cards that I already know well (so the &quot;Hard&quot; button should
send the card, like, 5 or 7 days or more into the future) show &quot;1 day&quot; above the &quot;Hard&quot;
button again. It appears just like I had that card wrong the day before, but I know
I didn't. It happens many times, even though I know I got these cards right the last
time. But I couldn't find a pattern, it seems quite random. Also the amount of cards
&quot;resetting&quot; themselves is seemingly random.

There is another &quot;bug&quot;(?), perhaps related: I set the sessions to 10 minutes, during
which I usually manage to do about 30 cards. As an example, after those 10 minutes,
during the last card, the display shows e.g. 52 cards left to review and maybe 2 wrong
cards. But then in the next screen, when showing how many cards are left to be reviewed
this day, it almost always shows a smaller amount. Maybe 50 instead of 54 in this example.
It's only about 1 to 5 cards less, but still... this is very strange.
But it's not that they vanish — Anki asks me these cards again the next day(s). I haven't
yet figured out if it's maybe exactly *those* &quot;vanishing&quot; cards that are resetted to
a one-day-delay on the next day.

As this is the only Anki deck I'm currently doing, I have no idea if it happens with
other decks on the AnkiDroid app, too. And because I don't use Anki on the computer,
I also don't know if the problem occurs there as well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 550 AnkiDroid won't display furigana anymore even though &quot;Provide 
ruby annotation support&quot; is enabled in the settings. 
I only use furigana markup (using the '[...]' syntax) in the answer 
section of cards, I don't know if it's related. 

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review the attached deck using Ankidroid
2. Notice that furigana is not displayed properly

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Furigana is not properly displayed, instead something like 食[た]べる
is displayed.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
version 0.6 beta 11 on android 2.2

It used to work fine with previous versions of Ankidroid (0.5 and earlier). I did not
test any previous 0.6 betas.
It also work just fine on Anki desktop.

I would rather be able to change the background from a bright white to a darker theme.
So when I'm reviewing at night the screen will not illuminate the room. Currently the

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 553 
I noticed recently in two of my decks that failing some cards would result in a big
rising of tomorrow's due cards. The result is a bit weird: after reviewing some 100
cards and failing a 10%, tomorrow's due cards as shown in statistics jump from more
or less 40 to 200, and I finish sometimes having more queued cards for tomorrow that
the total ones I reviewed today!

Strangely enough, this only happens when I fail cards, thus if I don't review any card,
tomorrow I'll often have less cards than if I try to review them. The result is more
than a month having 300+ cards for review each day, even if I review them and pass
90%. It's so frustrating!

I tried in Anki Desktop and, seeing stat's graphs, the problem doesn't seems to happen.

Low priority because:
- Users who created their deck with AnkiDroid most probably don't use HTML.
- Users who created their deck with Anki Desktop know that they can always use Anki
Desktop for card edition.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 556 comment from Yu at the list:
I noticed that in the list of texts to translate, there are lots of words
such as year/years, month/months, and day/days, which can be expressed by a
single Chinese character(年, 月, 日). So I dont know how to translate those
words precisely, or whether attach a measure word before a noun(it may have
a number before it to numerate) or not(it may not have a number before it).
Please provide some better contexts for those words if possible. Thanks.

We should indeed change all &quot;days&quot; to &quot;$1%d days&quot; to make it possible to choose the
position of the numbers and to make it clear for every developer in which sense a sentence
is used

This is a task for v0.7, since translation for v0.6 is quite advanced and shouldn't
be changed yet...

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 561 How to reproduce:

2) Enable TTS

I guess TTS is not available in Android 1.5 or something.
I guess not showing the option, or something more graceful than crashing could be better,
but very low priority bug, because Android 1.5 is old, and just disabling TTS makes
the crash go away.

Another wish would be for a way to add fonts that the app could use
instead of the system fonts. The standard Android Japanese font is
just horrible, and I don't want to root the Xoom, because I don't want
to void my warranty. Vertical Text Viewer gets around the rooting
issue by adding a Font directory that the app uses to display text in
Mincho. That might be something to think about... but anything is
better than the standard Google JP font. Considering that Google still
hasn't developed a JP keyboard, I wouldn't hold my breath on a
replacement JP font.

3. Using dark color for buttons in &quot;night-mode&quot;.
I can help in this section, in designing..

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 572 Hey,

it would be great if in &quot;revise early&quot; mode, it would be like on the desktop client
where on top it shows when the cards you're revising would be due (e.g. &quot;[due in 3
hours]&quot;). That way, you know until how far in the future you're currently revising.

Also, for the same purpose, it would be nice if the due statistics would show how many
cards will still be due today (day 0) and not start at day 1.

Cheers,
Marcel

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 577 At the picture that i attached, you can see two white bar at the top and the buttom
of the screen and they are diffrent from the card's color.
I think it would be better if they was the same as the card.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 578 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Add widget to home screen
2. Click on deck name (assuming there is at least a deck with due cards)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Deck is opened instead of deck list.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
dev0.7

lock, on review page of my 9000-cards Japanese deck:

Application AnkiDroid (in process com.ichi2.anki) is not responding.
Force close - Wait

I just have to click &quot;Wait&quot; and I can use AnkiDroid normally.

Has anyone noticed this recently?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 586 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a anki file with an underscore (&quot;_&quot;) in the filename on a desktop computer.
2. Synchronize it to the server.
3. Download it in Ankidroid.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

To give an example: I create new_main.anki on my desktop pc, synchronize it to the
Anki Server (new_main is created there) and then download it using the built-in download
function of ankidroid. Here lies the problem: Ankidroid saves the file as &quot;newmain.anki&quot;.
The next time I synchronize with ankidroid a new database (newmain) is created on the
server thus preventing successful synchronization between ankidroid and desktop versions.

Obviously not using underscores in filenames is a viable workaround ... so this issue
probably has a low priority, but seeing that the filesystem of android as well as Ankidroid
'can' handle underscores (for example after uploading the &quot;new_main.anki&quot; to my phone
manually) it might be something 'fixable' at some point. ;)

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

0.6 release version

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 587 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enable whiteboard for a deck
2. &quot;In Preferences -&gt; Extras -&gt; Reset&quot; choose &quot;Reset languages&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The whiteboard state for the deck is reset (i.e., whiteboard is no longer enabled by
default).
Resetting languages should not affect the whiteboard state.

The problem is that MetaDB.resetDB() deletes all settings and it is invoked by the
&quot;Reset languages&quot; option.
I will add a separate method only for resetting languages.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 592 Today I tried reviewing a deck, and the review screen is blank, see screenshot.

I don't know exactly with which commit it started, because I usually just check whether
it compiles before pulling, but it is very recent (after alpha2).

When I press back, a &quot;Saving changes&quot; popup starts spinning forever, which is a bit
worrying.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 596 Enhancement: 
Right now, users can either enable Zoom *OR* enable Swipe.  There are several swipe
actions.  I propose that we enable one of the swipe actions to be enable zoom....then
zoom would be active for some period (perhaps X seconds, or only the next touch?) so
that users who want to use swipe could also use zoom on occasion.

Actually, it would be great if one could use multi-touch and zoom (instead of the +
/- buttons) without any special preconditions within swipe, but I don't know how feasible
that is.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 604 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck in day mode, then go back to study options screen.
2. Enable night mode, and begin reviewing.
3. Also happens inversely, when entering first in night mode, then switching to day
mode.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

In night mode, a white band shows in top and bottom of the review screen. The top band
covers the indicators area, and renders invisible the due cards counter. The bottom
band shows just above the answer buttons.
In the night mode first version of the error, it happens exactly the same except that
the bands are black and the middle of the screen remains white.

When returning to the first selected mode, the problem disappears, bur reappears when
re-switching to the first selected mode. Strangely enough, the problem seems to have
&quot;memory&quot;, in that changing deck won't repair the problem and the first selected mode
for a specific deck will continue to be the correctly displayed.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

0.7 alpha2, on Android 2.2 and HTC Desire HD.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 607 If a deck on server has an apostrophe in its name, say a deck named &quot;Bob's stuff&quot;, it
can be downloaded to cell phone well, but when you sync it back, it would be uploaded
as &quot;Bobs stuff&quot;, then you get two decks on the server, &quot;Bob's stuff&quot; and &quot;Bobs stuff&quot;.

Using Android 2.1 and the latest version of Ankidroid from market (on April 30), sorry
I don't know where the version number is.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 608 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Answer a card (let's call it the &quot;Card A&quot;);
2. The next card is shown (let's call it the &quot;Card B&quot;);
3. Select &quot;Undo&quot; from menu;
4. The previous card (Card A) is shown again;
3. Select text (copy it to the clipboard);

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expect text from Card A (which is currently visible) to be copied to the clipboard.
However the text from Card B (which is not currently visible) has actually been copied.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid: v0.7alpha2
Android: 2.2.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Strangely, this does not happen in all my decks.
I have attached the faulty deck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 610 When editing the cards on computer, if I colored a word, say I make it red, and then
I changed my mind, I change it back to black. When I do this,I'll click the colors
button (or press F7) and click black, since black is already there in the drop down
menu, as the default color. Here's the problem - I did not clear the formatting, I
made it black. Then it's invisible in night mode.

Using Android 2.1 and the latest version of AnkiDroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 611 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Attempt to add a new card (Model:Japanese, Cards:Production, Recongition)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

When attempting to &quot;add&quot; the new card a pop-up window came up saying &quot;Saving Facts&quot;,
but it never went away. Ankidroid later crashed. I attempted to sync the deck to the
server and check it on PC. The PC client search said the card could not be found. I
tried to add it from the PC client but couldn't because it beleived that there was
a card for that Expression, even though I couldn't find it in a search. I attempted
to run the &quot;Advanced&gt; Check Database...&quot; function on the client and the card appeared
(wave form collapsed under observation I guess).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

0.7 Alpha 2 on Honeycomb 3.0.1 Motorola Xoom

Please provide any additional information below.
I only added text for the Expression and Meaning fields. Seems to be 100% reproducible.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 617 What steps will reproduce the problem?

2. Start reviewing
3. First question is &quot;[play button] Listen. What do you hear?&quot;

Please provide any additional information below.

Same behaviour from the only other deck I tried, &quot;Thai at Manoa&quot;
Both decks appear to contain .mp3 sound files, so should be playable.
This is not identical to Issue 493 as non-playing sound isn't dependent on showing
the answer.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 621 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use any deck with furigana enabled.
2. The line spacing is very uneven, so it is difficult to read.
3. The size of furigana is not adjustable.
4. All furigana are displayed, which is not necessarily helpful.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid-0.7alpha2.apk
Oxygen 2.0-RC7

Things that would improve this:

1. Being able to adjust the furigana size as you can with the font size in the preferences.
2. Even line spacing whether there is furigana or not, like in a Japanese textbook.
3. Display certain furigana only on tap (or some other method) as described on the
wiki for Anki Mobile:
http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html#_tweak_furigana

If there are CSS workarounds to add to the template, please post below (I tried line-spacing
in Anki but it just made the spacing between the previous line and the furigana bigger).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 623 Hello.

Since the .7alphas came out, I noticed the top and bottom bars are no longer fixed
to White.  This looks better with my black backgrounds, however it hides the cards
due and the scheduling information that is also printed in black.

Might I suggest that the top and bottom bars have a standard grey background, such
as many Android aps use?  In the Gmail ap, for instance, they use a grey background
at the bottom when you're reading an email.

Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 625 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Make a card layout which uses the conditional replacement feature as described here:
http://ankisrs.net/docs/CardLayout.html#_advanced_conditional_replacement
2. Have some conditional text like in the Answer like so:
{{#FieldName}}
Foo bar
{{/FieldName}}
3. In Ankidroid, open a card that has the field &quot;FieldName&quot; empty. Edit some portion
of the Answer, and save the card. 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The conditional text &quot;Foo bar&quot; should not be shown because FieldName is empty. However,
I see that this conditional text is displayed.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.6

Please provide any additional information below.
Saving the card in another anki client fixes this.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 639 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck
2. Start reviewing
3. Switch application
4. Switch back to AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The app should go back to reviewing, where it was left off.
Instead, it goes back to the study options.

This started happening with 0.7alpha releases and it is due to this change:
https://github.com/flerda/Anki-Android/commit/3be71bbdd9fcb544925da77a14f80f3305651c9a

The purpose of this change was to make widget and notifications work properly, i.e.,
open the given deck even if the app is already open. Unfortunately this causes the
bug described above.

Maybe adding:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
to those specific intents would be sufficient.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 640 Hi,

first of all thank you for this cool software - i really enjoy using it every day!

Maybe there is some space for improvement: I only have a 800mhz android device. When
i start ankidroid it loads all of my decks, to show me how many cards are on due, which
takes quite some time. when i switch from one deck to another these numbers are recalculated.
I dont know if it is possible to speed up the calculation, bus maybe it would be useful
to provide an option to omit these calculations? 

regards

Rather than force closing, we should tip the user that the full SD card is problematic.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 644 On the desktop client, one can elect to have decks sync upon opening and closing. I'd
like to have the same functionality available with ankidriod except with a dialogue
box that asks if you still want to open a deck in the even that a sync fails because
no network connection is present.

With such functionality, I would not need to worry whether I had synced my deck on
ankidroid. I've already forgotten twice-very annoying.

Also, I must say, you guys are doing a fantastic job. Thanks for all of your work.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 646 Just updated to 0.6 and am loving it.  Some great updates to the UI, especially having
statistics right on my phone.  That was one of the few reasons I ever synced decks
with the desktop.

I have a few feature ideas that I'd love to see added, some insired by the 0.6 changes:

1.  It would be great when reviewing in addition to the daily/lifetime averages bars
to have a bar that is for the current session.  I do many sessions throughout the day,
so the average becomes less useful later in the day.

2.  Most of my decks are set to schedule reviews when they're due, so cards appear
throughout the day.  The deckview does not update, though.  So currently to update
I cycle from the current deck into the view of all decks to get AnkiDroid to update
the cards to review.  Sometimes I just press review which also checks for new cards.
 Could we get a button or menu item to update the deck status page with due cards?
 It would reduce the number of clicks and screen changes a lot.

3.  One of my decks has &gt;4000 cards, so starting the card viewer takes a long time.
 Maybe allow some kind of initial filtering or a &quot;show first 50&quot; to speed it up a bit?

4.  It would be great if there were pinch gestures for zoom in/out on the statistics
pages.  The menu item takes too many clicks (and doesn't zoom enough).

Don't take the above as criticism.  I lobe the app, and use it *all the time*.  But
these would make it so much better, at least for me.

Thanks for all your hard work.

Geoff

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 650 The shared decks are a great pool of up-to-date decks.

We could write a tool that for each deck:
- Loads the deck
- Answer a card
- Closes the deck

This does not need to be linked with Android, this could be a test of java-libanki,
so it could run on a desktop PC.

To avoid putting too much pressure on Damien's server, we could copy the shared decks
as a big archive to our Google Project's downloads every time they are migrated to
a new format version.

It would produce a report showing for each deck success/failure and associated exceptions.

It would be very helpful for tests, just like countries-capitals.anki

Anybody (non-developer OK) willing to create them? About 5 cards per deck is enough.

Models.java was a singleton once in order to cache values (memory consumption vs. database

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 660 This might be a misunderstanding on how settings work, or maybe a problem with Anki's
scheduling, but here's the problem:

I have been experimenting with different scheduling algorithms.  For one deck, I routinely
fail new cards.  I have set the button 1 delay to 30 minutes, so that the new cards
should show up shortly after I first see them.  At that point, I score them normally.

To do this, I've set the button 1 delay to 30 minutes and the show failed cards early
to False (in Anki.  This option isn't exposed in AnkiDroid).

The failed card delay seems to be working for non-new cards, but not with new cards.
 As I review new cards, the cards I just failed minutes before start showing up.  And
I can't stop them from showing up unless I give them a non-failure.  This even if I've
set new cards to appear before reviews.

Now maybe I'm just not understanding how this is supposed to work, but it seems like
when you say you don't want failed cards to appear early, they shouldn't appear early,
whether then next card should be new or not.  What's going on here?  Is this a bug
in Ankidroid, or in Anki's scheduling algorithm?

I am using Ankidroid 0.7 beta 3 at the moment

(possibly the data and time of your device is wrong), therefore no sync possible

Date and timezone are all valid / the seconds stated above correspond to about 41 years

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 669 Hey there

While revising the deck http://www.enabeliro.net/download/ez.anki (has conditional
text), especially most of the time when I'm having the last 15 or so cards which are
already on the &quot;error pile&quot; and go through them again and again, suddenly some fields
(the fields Tuttledef or English, depending if there is a Tuttledef field or not) are
not shown anymore for some of the cards.

I think it's the generated html that has an error. When I sync the deck to the desktop
client, those cards are still showing up without those fields. However, if I edit them
in the desktop client, they go back to normal.

Also, note that the formatting of the &quot;Tuttledef&quot; field is different on Ankidroid compared
to the desktop client most of the time (way to small on Ankidroid most of the time,
sometimes it renders correctly).

That's the only deck I have problems with. It's also my only deck which uses conditional
text. However, I believe the problems were already there before using conditional text,
I'm not sure though.

I have the problem since AnkiDroid v. 0.7beta3 and it's still there in beta6. I'm using
the latest Cyanogenmod 7.1.0-RC10-11.06.14 (2.3.4) on my Motorola Milestone.

Cheers,
Marcel

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 670 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Turn on TTS
2. Review a card
3. Review another card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output is the tts sound without having to reselect the language. What I get
instead is the menu for selecting the tts language over again with every question and
answer.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Version 0.7beta6, Android 2.3.3

Please provide any additional information below.
Problem not present in version 0.6. Present with all the decks I've tried, including
new ones created in Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 671 I open the Text_To_Speech. When I am reviewing, The system will show the  dialogue to
let me choose the language to set. But every card which I review, I need to repeat
and repeat to reset again and again. It really annoyed me. I just want set once. I
don't want to every card I need to do the same thing.
It really important for me, so please help me debug this as soon as possible.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 676 Using 0.7beta6. Currently, in order to use the whiteboard, the user can or must choose
&quot;Show Whiteboard&quot; twice: once in the application preferences, and then again (on a
per-deck basis) while reviewing.

I think this duplication of the phrase &quot;Show Whiteboard&quot; is potentially confusing.

My proposed solution is to rename the &quot;Show Whiteboard&quot; preference (under &quot;Extras&quot;)
to &quot;Enable Whiteboard&quot; (or simply &quot;Whiteboard&quot;).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 679 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Input arabic text on computer and load anki deck on android 2.2/
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Desired output is arabic text RTL.  Text that it output is normal.  

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.6
0.7 alpha 4
or 0.7 beta 6

Please provide any additional information below.
This is a known android issue but I saw a previous post that listed a additional script
that was added to the alpha version and now works.  I loaded this but the test was
still LTR instead of RTL.  
https://github.com/simar0at/Anki-Android/commit/1f663a64799012f5557b96b7e894b2a050eb09a4

Further info, my phone doesn't do RTL also but I know that the java work around should
correct this internal to the program.  

I can upload a deck to use as an example if desired

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 680 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Disable phone screen auto rotate assuming it isn't already disabled.
2. Open a deck and select sync.
3. After sync the screen rotates when you tilt the phone.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The screen automatically rotates after synchronizing the deck with Anki online even
though it is disabled in the phone options. Before the sync everything works as expected
(no rotation). Closing and re-opening the deck also fixes the auto rotating back to
disabled. 
I assume this bug is related to http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=481

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Ankidroid 0.6

My steps:
1. I changed some item in ankidroid during review (I added four points &quot;....&quot; to front
field)
2. Sync with Anki for Windows
3. Put four points to “Search” field in desktop “Brouwse items” – the item isn’t here.
If I find the item with another way, the item is correct – with four points.
If I check database (menu Tools – Advanced - Check database), put four poits to search
field again, everything is OK.

Android: 2.3.3
Ankidroid: 0.7beta7
Anki: 1.2.8

Currently it is not possible to view that information on AnkiDroid so the user has

Seems to now be that the question is displayed in the Ankidroid default font. In the
deck I tried, it used to be default font for the answer and kanji stroke orders for
one field in the question.

I went back to beta 6 and my question displays in kanji stroke orders. I then tried
beta8 again and the question displays on the default font. I can get kanji stroke orders
into the question by making that my default font, but didn't want to do that.

The problem its also present in beta7.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 686 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck with some cards on the web interface
2. Sync the deck and study the on your android device
3. Add more cards via the web interface
4. Sync the deck on your Android device again
5. You get a warning that the deck has changed locally and server-side and you have
to choose which to keep.  Keeping server-side (the one that includes the new cards
results in all your data from your previous study session to be deleted, so you have
to go through all your &quot;knowns&quot; all over again.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
See #5 above

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Froyo on G1 running cyanogen

Please provide any additional information below.
I'm new to Anki, so LMK if I'm just doing something wrong.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 689 I don't have any repro steps for this, but today AnkiDroid crashed while I was reviewing
and when I restarted the program, the deck I was reviewing was gone and the file was
no longer on my SD Card.

I think it would make sense to employ some periodic backup strategy like Anki standalone
does, so that if a crash corrupts or eliminates a deck, it's still possible to fish
out a recent version.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 694 From time to time, when loading a deck the progress dialog does not disappear although
the deck is fully loaded (logcat says: &quot;I/AnkiDroid( 9390): Deck loaded!&quot;, study options
screen shows all deck information (correct number of cards, progress, etc). 

Seems as if onPostExecute of mLoadDeckHandler is not executed. I was finally able to
reproduce this:

1. download farbtest.anki from mydecks
2. open android's message window
3. click on the deck's name to open it in ankidroid

I'm really puzzled, I've no clue, why this happens.

But because this seems to happen mainly for new downloaded decks, we should definitely
solve it before releasing!

Cheers!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 695 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. choose tags to limit learning in ankidroid
2. sync
3. check tags selected to selective learning in anki (pc)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The tags aren't sync from ankidroid to pc nor from pc to ankidroid if you do it the
other way round.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
version 0.7beta13 on android 2.2

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 697 Norbert has suggested a tool to &quot;fix&quot; decks &quot;tainted&quot; by buggy HTC Sense phones:
http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=545#c41

How about creating a web application for this?
I just created this project:
https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/transdeck

Scenario:
1) User opens http://fixdeck.appspot.com in browser
2) User clicks on &quot;Browse&quot;, select deck, submits
3) Servlet loads deck as an InputStream
4) Servlet fixes the deck using SQLJet or another SQLite library available on AppEngine
5) Servlet saves deck as an OutputStream
6) The user's browser receives the fixed deck and asks where to save it, directly as
a response to the request in step 2

I implemented the general idea, and now it works if you upload for instance a simple
text file.
The hard work will now be to integrate SQLJet, which requires to implement this:
http://code.google.com/p/sqljet/issues/detail?id=159

We could reuse this app for this: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=696

The latest version of AnkiDroid from the Android Market.
I created a new deck in Anki PC, synchronized with Anki Web and then I try to synchronize
with AnkiDroid, but it turned out otherwise - AnkiDroid synchronize only existed decks
and doesn't want to see/create a new one.

I solved this problem with an algorithm: I created an empty deck in AnkiDroid with
the same name as a new deck in Anki PC, and after synchronization I've got a required
deck in AnkiDroid with all flashcards. but anyway it's not a good decision.

Hey all,

I looked around a little, but the similar problems that I have found
seem to be solved.  I'm using the new Casio IA11CA G'z phone that just
came out in Japan, and I can't get my deck to sync properly.
Everything downloaded fine, and I the media now works properly, but
when I sync it gets stuck &quot;uploading&quot; and doesn't stop.  I'm using
Android 2.3, Ankidroid 0.6, and my deck is 61.4Mb connected to media
files in Dropbox.

Any guidance would be appreciated.  I'm new to the Android world, so
don't really know where to begin.  Anki is a huge part of my daily
routine, though, so I would like to get this sorted as quickly as
possible.

Thanks for what otherwise seems to be an amazing app!

Anki Desktop allows to choose whether to display furigana in question by editing furigana.py
file.

Is there any chance, u could expand the white board feature.
As it is, it is already very useful for ppl studying Japanese characters (like I do),
but the current layout makes such study difficult.
I would propose, that whilst the WB is enabled, the space designated for question and
answer is squeezed so there is more space on the screen to write on(but not to overwrite
neither question nor answer field).

In night mode, the display flashes white and it takes some time before showing the
characters. In day mode, the characters are display fast, without any lag. 

Actually, it seems that now there is no lag anymore, but it flashes white every time
I see a new card.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 715 On a tablet when loading a deck with flash cards that has lots of information in the
answer section, the user does not need to scroll to read the description just like
on a phone as the screen is large enough to show the entire description. Because of
lack of interactivity from the user, the screen after few seconds will lower brightness
and eventually turns itself off and get locked.

This is a problem on a tablet as it keeps happening. There should be an option for
tablets to keep screen always on and prevent lock mode.

While reproducing the crash reported in Issue 720, I got a typical crash message (&quot;Sorry!...stopped
unexpectedly... Force close&quot;). (Using 0.7beta20).

Usually, when I start AnkiDroid the next time after such a crash, AnkiDroid's built-in
crash reporter will appear and offer to send a stacktrace report. But in this case
the reporter never appeared, so I grabbed the log with Log Collector instead.

Why didn't AnkiDroid's crash reporter appear after this crash? Does it only appear
for certain types of crashes?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 727 Using 0.7beta23 on Android 2.2.1.

Steps:
1. Load Minimal.anki and Minimal.media from Issue 720.
2. Start reviewing the Minimal deck in day mode.
3. Don't type anything in the box. Tap the &quot;OK&quot; button.
4. Go back and repeat steps 2 and 3, but in night mode.

Result: As expected, the standard Android &quot;Web page not available&quot; page appears in
the iframe (since a nonexistent HTML page is being requested). But in night mode, its
text is black on black, so the only visible parts are the blue link and the green/white
Android logo. Compare attached screenshots.

So, when the &quot;Web page not available&quot; page comes up in night mode, can either its text
or its background be changed to white, so the text is visible?

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

AnkiDroid v0.6, Android v2.2.2.

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 735 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create or upload a large deck on Ankiweb.
2. open Ankidroid, input your Ankiweb credentials
3. click &quot;download deck&quot;, then &quot;Personal Deck&quot;
4. Click on your deck as listed under &quot;Personal decks&quot;. Download starts.
5. Before the download is over, click on your deck again. A second, simultaneous download
of the same deck starts.
6. Click on your deck a third time. You now have three simultaneous downloads of the
same deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect anki to refuse downloading the same deck twice simultaneously.
Instead, the same deck appears multiple times under &quot;Currently downloading&quot;.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

Ankidroid 0.7beta23.

Please provide any additional information below.

If I attempt to download a deck which has already finished downloading, I get a warning
message asking if I really want to re-download it. This is what I expected.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 736 Is it possible to use key actions to control ankidroid?

For example I would like to use the &quot;1&quot; to answer with &quot;again&quot;.

(My aim is to use a zeemote stick with Anki on android. I connected the stick with
Bluez IME, which seems to work fine: I am able to customize the key mapping of the
zeemote stick. For example I can trigger the &quot;1&quot; key with a joystick up movement. Now
I would like to use the &quot;1&quot; key action like on a PC to answer the card.)

1. (in AnkiDroid) “Menu”. “All decks”. “Create deck”. Create a deck with the name “test”

2. (in AnkiDroid) I open an empty deck “test”. “Menu”. “Add card”. Create 1 card.
3. (in AnkiDroid) «Card Browser”. Add a new tag “urgent” to single card. 
4. (in AnkiDroid) The deck has only one card. This card is new (and have never review).
 In window “Study Options”: “Reviews due: 0, New today: 1, New total: 1» Everything
is good.
5. (in AnkiDroid)  In window “Study Options”. Press “Limit”. Limit learing – by tag.
Show new cards by tag: “urgent”
6. (in AnkiDroid) In window “Study Options”: “Reviews due: 0, New today: 0, New total:
1» Error. Why is the “New today: 0” - if I had not taught at all (I did not press the
&quot;Start View&quot;, and I have in the deck new card” 
7. (in Anki Windows) Copy the deck from Android-devices on Windows 7. I open the deck
“test” in Anki. 
8. (in Anki Windows) In Anki. In window “Study Options”: “Reviews due: 0, New today:
0, New total: 0» Error. I have a new card.
10. (in Anki Windows) Click &quot;List all cards&quot; - I see the list. There is one card. She
has a tag “urgent&quot;. When I install a filter: only “urgent&quot;. Anki shows an empty list.
Error!
11. (in Anki Windows) I remove the tag “urgent” from single card. Save it. Add the
same tag “urgent” again. The filter is now operating normally. It shows a single card
with a tag “urgent”.

Total: If I create a new tag in AnkiDroid, it does not work properly in AnkiDroid and
Anki. If you create a new tag in Anki - is working properly.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 746 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open the attached deck in AnkiDroid. It's the country-capitals deck, but each card
is tagged with the country's first letter.
2. Tap &quot;Limit&quot;, uncheck &quot;Session&quot;, and tap &quot;Save&quot;, to turn off limiting.
3. Tap &quot;Cram&quot;, check &quot;C&quot;, tap &quot;Start Cram mode&quot;, and tap &quot;Start Reviewing&quot;, to start
reviewing countries that start with &quot;C&quot; (Cambodia, Canada, etc.).
4. Answer the cards as &quot;Again&quot; about 10 times or so. The 5 cards starting with &quot;C&quot;
are shown over and over, as expected when cramming by tag.
5. Now start answering the cards as &quot;Good&quot;. After each of the 5 &quot;C&quot; cards has been
answered &quot;Good&quot; once, AnkiDroid starts showing other cards (France, Peru, etc.)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output: Since I'm cramming the &quot;C&quot; tag, I expect to see only cards with that
tag.

Observed output: I'm seeing other cards besides the &quot;C&quot; cards.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 752 I'm using the newest AnkiDroid (0.7?) on an htc Desire with Android 2.2. I'm doing a
self-made deck called &quot;Beginner's Klingon&quot; (don't laugh!) which asks me English-Klingon
as well as Klingon-English. Both directions.

Until before the latest update (3 days ago or so), Anki always used to ask me new cards
in the direction English-Klingon. A card's sibling (in the direction Klingon-English)
appeared a few minutes later, sometimes the next day.

Now it's different: New cards are asked in a random direction. Some new cards appear
as English-Klingon, some as Klingon-English. I don't want it that way. Plus, the siblings
don't seem to be connected anymore. They do not appear shortly after their counterpart
anymore.

I just looked at a pair of cards' details. One card I have answered yesterday or the
day before is rescheduled to appear in 3 days. It's sibling, the other direction, shows
it's a new card that hasn't been asked yet. BOTH cards(!) show a changed date of &quot;25/08/2011&quot;.
That's yesterday. I did not change these cards yesterday, though. Another vocabulary
item, where both cards haven't been asked yet, both show &quot;13/07/2011&quot; as their changed
date — the date I created them.
A new card I have answered right now for the first time, shows today's date as changed
date. Its sibling, which I haven't seen yet (and which like will not appear anytime
soon), shows the same date. Again, I didn't modify them.
I see that anytime one answers a card, it get's &quot;changed&quot;, but I find it strange that
the sibling, which I haven't seen yet, is changed too. Maybe this is an old hat for
you, but I'm just saying... maybe it helps.

Please fix these two problems. :/

Latest version...

Please provide any additional information below.
The tibetan characters are Unicode, not a specific font, as far as i know android does
not support tibetan unicode directly, i have a work around, but it requires embedding
the font in the application, i am wondering if this is a problem with any other languages?

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Have had the same problem with both 0.7 from market and also the sideloaded 1.0.  Android
v. 2.2 on Samsung Captivate.

Everytime I try to sync my deck it crashes while saying 'applying changes'.  I've tried
adding my deck both through USB and through Ankiweb, to get the same results.  Have
run a database check on the deck on my computer, didn't make a difference.  Attached
are the jsonObjectAndroid.txt and payloadAndroid.txt produced right after the crash.
 Let me know if I can get you anymore information to solve this.  If it helps to know,
my deck is large. Over 20,000 cards, and deck is over 70mb in size.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 762 I choose nook touch only to study with ankidroid but I had a bad surprise. &quot;All&quot; works
fine but de program don´t refresh the Eink screen.

I find a topic in XDA forum of an user how make FBReaderJ Partial
Refresh Works on Nook2. I the forum DairyKnight  &quot;encouraged everyone
to use this piece of code for anything, either commercial or free,
either close-sourced or open-sourced&quot;.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1183173

The whole app works. Only after click &quot;start reviewing&quot; the problem
starts. The buttons and the Swype and gestures in touchscreen works
but the questions and answers do not refresh, only the first question
appear.
If it helps I can make a video.

Hey all,
I've been using ankidroid to practice Koine Greek and it requires the ancient diacritical
marks.  I use the rooted phone method to move the fonts.zip to my system/fonts folder
and the it was working great.
After the update [to 0.7] I have lost that support I tried selecting the different
fonts manually in preferences/other/default font, but that didnt' seem to make any
changes.  Any ideas?

I didn't make the deck myself, but it has been working with the rooted phone, custom
font thread that has been up for a few months.
Thanks,
Jesse 

I've tried the rooted method and the new custom font method and for some reason can't
figure out why I've lost the font support.  It seems pretty odd to me. 

Does anyone have any ideas of why I would lose font support after updating to 0.7?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 764 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.with the new update to anki 0.7 on android, when i click on card browser, it does
NOT show all of the card, nor all of the answer compared to the version i had before.
as a result of not showing all on the screen, the search cannot search all of the card,
only what is shown on screen. meaning i cannot find anything meaningful because what
i want to search for is not entirely shown on the screen to be searched ! how do i
change it back to before ?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 774 I use animated GIF images to practice Japanese kanji stroke orders on my desktop Anki.
Ankidroid however does not play animated GIFs. Seeing as how it seems many versions
of Android do not support animated GIFs, I surmise that Ankidroid uses some image renderer
provided by the OS. In that case, maybe it is possible to render animated GIFs internally
instead?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 776 I was trying out the 1.0 alpha, just to see if there were any features yet that I couldn't
live without and discovered this problem.  I think it has to do with the new theming
feature.

I have a deck with two images in the answer that appear side by side (for comparison).
 They've always displayed side by side, but they just fit.

With the new theming (I think it's called 'blue') there is a border around the card,
and this causes them to appear in a column.  Even with the old 'dark' theme, which
doesn't have this border, this happens.  Is there an invisible border here as well,
or did it increase in size?  And more importantly to me, can we get it put back to
whatever it was?  Or just have a theme that has it set to the minimum possible?  With
small screens on phones, screen real estate needs to be conserved for data which matters,
IMO.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 777 Hi togother,

I would like to have an option for automatically skipping the answer after a couple
of seconds with &quot;again&quot; and proceed to the next question (like it already works with
&quot;show answer&quot; for showing the answer after the question.)
This would allow to listen to the material without clicking interactions (&quot;I want to
ride my bicycle…&quot;).It might not be effective learing, but in some situations it would
be helpful. 
Sunny regards,

Stefan

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 785 While sequence of characters can be easily selected and copied, the same cannot be said
for single characters, standalone or in compounds. While it's meaningless for western
languages, copying kanji with issue like that is impossible.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enter 'selection mode' (either by long-press or through menu)
2. Change selection range to fit one character
3. Try to click on it to copy

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Multiple characters selection is highlighted, while one-character is not (therefore
clicking on it does nothing).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 786 Not sure, if it's anki or aedict problem, but while most of the compounds are copied
and translated correctly, some of them are not.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Copy random compound-word with some really frequent kanji in it (e.g., 小指)
2. Look it up in aedict

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Some of the kanji will not be copied 'as is', but will be replaced by 'rectangles'
(unknown symbols). Fore example, in case of 「小指」 it will be 「小] .

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.7 and 1.0alpha3

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 790 Google is blocking Bluetooth-using apps from appearing on the Market for Android 1.5
and 1.6 devices, because Bluetooth is not secure on those devices.

Despite being old, 1.5 and 1.6 are still important: 4% of our users are using them
(=2000 active installs)

A solution would be to put the Bluetooth code in &quot;AnkiDroid Bluetooth plugin&quot;, it would
be called by AnkiDroid via intents or something similar.

What do you think?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 791 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card with any unicode character 0x12000 through 0x1236E (maybe others)
2. Set the display font to Assurbanipal
3. Install the font in /sdcard/AnkiDroid/fonts
4. Sync Deck
5. Review

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output is the display of the cuneiform characters.  I do not see anything
instead (no boxes, diamods or anything just blank white space... this is different
if I don't set the font and it displays two diamonds with question marks in it).

I have verified that the custom font feature works (and I know how to make it work
on android) because I am able to change the font for my Hebrew deck (0x05b0-0x05ea).
 Also, I have changed the default font on my android device to be able to display the
cuneiform characters and as such I can see the proper characters in the card-browser
screen and the card-edit screen just NOT the card-review screen.  I can even view the
cards in the android web browser.

I've attached the deck and the font if you want to verify (the font is free oss)


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid 0.7
Android 2.3.3
(2.6.37.4-cyanogenmod-01338-g0374804)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 792 Seen this comment on Market, I am not sure what it means but could someone have a look?
Maybe it is just the widget starting? Or is there something that starts even when no
widget is used?

Incredibly useful. Just one concern. Why does the service need to start at boot?

I think this would apply to the Congratulations screen and also to the 'Session limit

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 794 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create deck, and give it a whitespace in the name. Synchronize it with Anki web,
and upload a few media files to Dropbox.
2. Try synchronizing said files in AnkiDroid with &quot;Download Missing Files&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the media files to be synchronized, instead nothing gets downloaded. For decks
without whitespaces in their name, it synchronizes without problem, and if I try to
synchronize again, and no new files are found, I get &quot;No media files found missing&quot;.
On the other hand, with decks with whitespaces if I try synchronizing, I get &quot;Successfully
retrieved 0, missing 0&quot;, regardless of nothing getting synchronized. 

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.7, Gingerbread, Galaxy Tab, Overcome ROM.

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 803 The wiki on Google Project has two big problems:
1) Passers-by can not edit, their email address must be registered manually by an admin
2) Internationalization requires Subversion tricks.

Which wiki could we use instead?
Github's wiki would be very convenient and reduce the gap between contributing to the
wiki and contributing code, but it does not seem to support internationalization (ie:
one page has an English version, a French version etc)

Hero, Android 2.1). After doing that I have the problem described above (in Ankidroid
0.7 and 1.0 beta2).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 821 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start reviewing a card with audio, and answer it.
2. After answering it, try to replay it.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the audio to play, but it doesn't.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.7, Gingerbread, Galaxy Tab, Overcome ROM.

Please provide any additional information below.
In the Desktop version of Anki, you can replay the audio in the question even after
answering it, so that was the behavior I expected from AnkiDroid. I tried adding the
same audio to the question and the answer, but then in the Desktop version it would
play both of them whenever I hit the play button, so that's not an option.

2. If you use the Menu Button and the touch the &quot;Select Text&quot;, a cursor will show and
then disppear quickly. I can't select text.

3. Longclick works for me in most time. But it sometime the ankidroid's behavior is
as same as above. A cursor will show and then disppear quickly. This seems happened
randomly.

2. Sorting by Answer is actually sorting by Question.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 829 Card Broswer is too slow. Showing 5000 cards need about 5 seconds on my smartphone.
I often use this feature. Waiting more than 1s is annoying.

Can we add a setting that limit the size of the result to increase the efficiency?
Or we just load everything into the memory so that we only need to load once but not
everytime we open the Card Broswer. (Since many smartphone has huge memory)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 830 Currently, if you are in a deck’s main windows, there is the button “card browser”.
Used to this from other Android apps, I tend to press the hardware search button to
open it - but nothing happens.

Wouldn’t it be nice to open the card browser if one presses the search button?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 832 Is it true that if I accidentally select the incorrect text for a dictionary lookup,
I then have to look it up in the dictionary (it probably won't be a word and won't
be found), before I am able to re-select text.
Am I missing something or doing something wrong?
If not, wouldn't it be better to 
1. select text
2. choose lookup OR select text/re-select   ?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 833 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. With AnkiDroid 0.7, change some options, like when new cards should be shown (before
or after review)
2. Synchronize to the server.
3. Synchronize from Anki Desktop.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The option on Anki Desktop is not sync'ed to the one on AnkiDroid, while it should
be.

Still to retest on 1.0beta, but reading the code seems to show that two options are
just not synched and it can be easily fixed. Testing the issue on 1.0 will take more
time.

2. Press the sync button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
When logging into Ankiweb and starting to review the set it starts at the beginning
instead of the position it was saved on the phone. Apparently the progress was not
synced.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Android 2.3.3 Cyanogenmod 7, Ankidroid 0.7

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 845 Our crash-collect-app is a tool of outstanding helpfulness. I use it every day to fix
crashes of current beta versions.

Sometimes, it's hard to find the source of a crash (sometimes even impossible), so
it would be quite useful to have the user's comment too. They often say something like
&quot;happened, when I clicked twice on X&quot;.

Of course, if more than one crash is reported, it might be a wrong comment attached
to a crash, but if one bears that in mind, it would not be a problem. More information
is always better than less...

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 846 If I understood this correctly, the only way to mark a bug in AnkiDroid-Triage as fixed,
is to attach it to an issue and mark this issue as &quot;fixed&quot;.

As it's not always necessary to create an issue for every small bug which is solved
anyway, it would be useful, to mark it without a detour as fixed.

Another possibility would be to create a fixed &quot;ghost&quot; issue and attach every solved
bug to it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 847 We should make the user feedback somehow. There might be some useful comments which
could be missed if they are only view once in a while via the db viewer of google app

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 849 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start Anki 1.0beta22 (or previous I guess, even if commit 90bca9287731e22597d31bf265168ae743667241
adds a call to waitToFinish() but in closeOpenedDeck(), which seems not to be called
here).
2. Immediately, during deck loading, press Back
3. The deadlock might or might not happen - I got once today a screen which was unresponsive
and completely black (i.e. empty, I'm using the Android Black theme).

I attached with the Eclipse debugger, and I performed a thread dump thread-by-thread.
No thread seemed to be doing anything, and the thread dump reveals a set of waiting
threads which seems to be a deadlock. A possible alternative is maybe that the thread
which was progressing just 

Noticeable calls relevant to the deadlock are in the first 4 threads and have to do
with decks, e.g. DeckPicker.waitForDeckLoaderThread(), DeckTask.waitToFinish() and
two DeckTask.doInBackground(DeckTask$TaskData...).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 853 By Tomasz Melcer:

When answering questions, in the top-left corner AnkiDroid displays
numbers such as number of failed cards, number of cards to review,
number of new cards. They give a nice overview of how much is there to
review.

However, the current card's status is shown there by placing an
underscore under one of these numbers. I'd like to remove this
underscoring, because it gives me additional clues on the card's answer.
Here's explanation:

I often have several cards which are very similar in question, for
example I tend to mistake Japanese characters which are very similar.
Let say I've got two such cards: A and B, and I failed card A today.
When I see either A or B later today, by looking at whether that card is
in the failed stack or review stack I can infer which one is it. That's
of course unintended behavior.

Is it possible to remove that underscore?

It's perfect !! especially Gestures.

but Anki for iPad have option for Repeat audio. - It's very useful.

I can't find option for repeat audio In Gestures Menu.


( I think that repeat audio button is too small - It's not good :-)

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 856 The custom font support works really well, but I have one additional idea:

Sometimes, I would like to mix Western and Japanese scripts, for example in an “explanation”
field. If I do this, I stumble across one of the following problems

1. No custom fonts for this field: I get a Chinese font for Japanese, but the right
(=desired) font for e.g. German.

2. Japanese font for this field: Japanese is displayed properly, but German is ugly
(because Japanese fonts usually don’t have nice latin glyphs).

So I wonder if it were possible to select custom fonts for complete scripts, regardless
of the field. This could be done by comparing the value of a character with a list
of characters used in one language.

For example, you have a data file “Japanese”, which lists all characters used in Japanese
(Just use the current Shift-JIS list; so all Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, punctuation
marks etc). You have another list with Chinese and so on. In the settings of Ankidroid,
you can then select “Japanese font: MS Mincho” or “Chinese font: PMingLiU”. 

I guess this would not only be interesting for Chinese, Japanese or Korean, but also
for other languages like Tibetan, Devanagari, Greek etc. - whereever one does not like
the original font or where there is none provided by Android.

Additionally, I guess this would make it easier for most people who just want to have
Japanese displayed with a Japanese font - copy a Japanese font onto the device, select
it in Ankidroid and voilà. No need for fine tuning in Anki.

1. Open the learning options
2. select the “new cards in which order” button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The text is cut off in the german translation, because the text is too long in vertical
direction. It should be “Neue Karten in umgekehrter Reihenfolge des Hinzufügens”, but
instead I can only see “Neue Karten in umgekehrter Reih”. It works fine if I use the
phone horizontally (because then the screen is in widescreen)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 861 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open AnkiDroid
2. Sync
3. The frozen screen

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
If I open AnkiDroid and tap to the sync button, I see &quot;the frozen&quot; screen with a menu
without any action. 
Sometimes the sync button gets red but screen is frozen. The same state is if I sync
all decks. Sometimes help if I press the back button, sometimes I see only a result
message after sync. 
I can see an Android message &quot;... wait or close application...&quot; very often.
Sometimes if I run the sync again, AnkiDroid told that there aren't any changes between
AnkiDroid and server. I think that AnkiDroid upload changes to the server without a
result message.

My typical work is:
- reviewing (on my way from or to work) - without an internet connection
- at work or at home run AnkiDroid and start Sync 

If I sync my deck after a review, it is OK. 


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid 1.0 beta29 
LG P500 with Android 2.3.3


Please provide any additional information below.
I tried: 
- restart my mobile - without changes.
- the same action with another mobile phone(Samsung mini - Android 2.2) with the same
result

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Front should have focus when new card is to be added. Especially since keyboard is
visible. If there is no focus, this is not easily discovered by the user, and the user
starts typing without any result and has to redo typing after manually selecting front.

The problem started when I opened a deck for reviewing. After review of the first card,
the program crashed. I tried many times again, and eventually decided to reinstall,
but it still crashed, even in newer versions (1.0alphas). So I deleted the ankidroid
folder from the Sdcard and reinstall again, but now the folder even can't create, so
i Can't open the sample deck (when I try, it writes &quot;No decks found), Can't download
my personal deck. I tried also to create &quot;AnkiDroid&quot; folder manually and to copy anki
file I exported, but seems it doesn't identify anything. 

Please Help Me!

And sorry about my english. I need the software to improve it ;-)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 876 Hello,

Thank you so much for working on ankidroid and helping the community. Here is my issue.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Download the public kanji deck &quot;RTK-Ultima&quot;, or any other deck &gt;25MB

2. Open up the deck and start the review of cards

3. When progressing to the next card, it takes about 2 seconds to load (regardless
of phone, CPU (i tried this on my android, and my freind on his galaxy 2 1.5ghz phone,
same delay). Ankidroid is slow for progressing to the next card, while Anki on iphone
is normal speed for this deck.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Cards are much slower on ankidroid versus Anki Desktop or Anki Iphone Versions.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Im using the latest 1.0beta36.apk. Ive also tested this on 1.0beta35,34,33 and 0.7beta.



Please provide any additional information below.

Thank you for your guidance. This is not specific to the RTK large decks, but rather
any large deck ( I think as it gets &gt;25MB or so).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 877 What steps will reproduce the problem?
01. Open Anki on Windows 7
02. Set DropBox as media holder
03. Make a new deck: Elemi függvények deriváltja
04. Add a new chard
      * Front: [$]\text{tg }x[/$]
      * Back: [$]{1 \over \text{cos}^2 x}[/$]
05. Save
06. Set deck to sync with AnkiWeb
07. Close deck (now syncing again the app)

08. Open AnkiDroid on my Android
09. Download the &quot;Elemi függvények deriváltja&quot; deck
10. Open it and start practice
11. The equitation was not shown, only a frame


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
 * Shown the correct format of equitation like on desktop Anki

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
 * AnkiDroid v1.0
 * Anki for Windows v1.2.8

Please provide any additional information below.
 * My Dropbox folder contains the requested files
       Dropbox\Public\Anki\Elemi függvények deriváltja.media\
         latex-168d0ab137ce0839798fd5e38403b3e4.png
         latex-207d1cf61e201cf9205670cd10919593.png
 * If I longpress on deck and select &quot;Downloading missing media&quot; item then it say:
&quot;Successfully retrived 0, missing 0&quot;
 * Not exists the &quot;/sdcard/AnkiDroid/Elemi függvények deriváltja.media&quot; folder
 * If I try to repair or anything else then it will not be fixed.
 * I checked the .anki file with an SQLIte browser. It contain correct Dropbox URL
and correct filename.

* If my deck's name is &quot;Elemi fuggvenyek derivaltja&quot; (it's contain only English chars)
then the equitation will not shown BUT the frame contains a question mark
    * Now exists the &quot;/sdcard/AnkiDroid/Elemi fuggvenyek derivaltja.media&quot; folder (note:
without hungarian letters) but it's empty
    * The &quot;Downloading missing media&quot; can't fixing this problem too

I attached the .anki file

Actually one of my deck (11M in size) is very vulnerable in ankidroid. It crashes frequently,
but when I send the stacktrace back to you guys, it just complaints there is no connection,
however the device do connects with the internet, WIFI or 3G.

I want to know why the deck is so vulnerable. Thanks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 883 Hey,

referring to this issue: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=477 we
were asked to post some recognized problems.

First of all, I like your work and the possibility to have Arabic flash-cards, but
I still found some small issues. One letter, the 'hamza', is missing. For example the
word &quot;water&quot; should look like this: ماء but instead you sea: ما

There is no reshaping/concatenation for hyphens. There are used to show some more space
between letters without loosing concatenation of the whole word.

Have a nice day

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 901 First off, thanks for AnkiDroid!

I'd like to provide a little patch:
When reviewing cards in the train/etc the need to pause your learning and resume at
a later point comes up often. As (on low-memory devices) closing and restarting the
app later didn't work nicely i've wrote a little patch that'll let you &quot;pause&quot; a session.

I hope i've done this more or less correct in the respective environment ... sorry
if not!


Secondly i've noticed that alpha15 (12d6c68e3ac143dd62f4659f29c73b6b233acac6) tends
to crash when i (from the studyoptions activity) go back to the launcher (home button),
do something, maybe let some &quot;memory cleaner&quot; app clean the memory, then re-open aniki
i've experienced crashes with:
java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.ichi2.anki/com.ichi2.anki.StudyOptions}:
java.lang.NullPointerException
[...]
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.ichi2.anki.StudyOptions.onPrepareDialog(StudyOptions.java:1724)

I've also tried to fix that (it does work for me, nothing else stopped working, but
i'm quite sure its the wrong way i did it...).

My changes can be pulled from http://dyn.kanojo.de/~daddel9/ankidroid-patch-git/ .

Thanks again for the great project, regards
- Dario Ernst

PS: Please, close/delete Issue 900 - i've accidentially hit enter and there seems to
be no way to delete the issue ... ;/

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 902 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enable whiteboard
2. Start reviewing
3. Open context menu

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It would be nice if Undo doesn't end up in the sub-menu &quot;More&quot; (probably because 6
or 7 icons seems to be the max).
I'm sure 8 icons can easily fit in the same menu so that 2 keypress are not required
(or otherwise, make undo higher priority to end up in the first screen since it's probably
much more useful than some other options).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
1.0

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 905 First reported by S Goorha, reproduced by me on my HTC Magic.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. From deck picker, download
2. Select: Shared deck
3. OutOfMemoryError

Afterwards, the deck picker is shown again (my own decks), or the list of shared decks
picker appears containing zero elements.

I also saw it happen on a friend's phone, she was running AnkiDroid 1.0 on what seemed
to be a reasonably recent phone.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 913 Hi,

If I do not know how to read correct a word. I would to use TTS.

But it would be good if I can use for Ankidroid a own language.

I use TTS German to read my epubs.

But I need TTS for Ankidroid only for English.

So it would be hard to change the TTS on the android system every time I want to lern.

or is there an app to change fast the TTS. That would be enough.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 915 When one chooses to show projected intervals, it would be great if the text (easy, good,
hard, poor) was supplanted by the intervals.  The text is a bit superfluous, and this
would reserve more screen space for the card itself.  In fact, this might be a good
default setting.

Thanks.

I tried running alpha 11 to 18 on i5500 with android 2.2 and 2.3 but it always forceclose.
I tried them on a fake apad (wm8505 300mhz processor) and it ran. I tried a lcd resolution
hack on i5500 which increased its density from 120 to 100 and alpha 18 worked flawlessly.
I hope that future ankidroid versions will work with low resolution such as samsung
galaxy i5500. Thank you.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 929 for all of my decks (4 of them), after reviewing all cards for a given day
the deck picker shows 1 card is still due (see Deck_Picker.png). However the
deck itself indicates all cards are actually reviewed, and so does the
widget.

I also noticed that the greeting message after review is over is weird (see
End_Review.png): the message in the screenshot is in French but looks like
&quot;Tomorrow there will be 59 cards to review and 1 card.&quot; Seems to me like a
word is missing somewhere, possibly indicating something else went wrong.

With AnkiDroid 1.0 and Android 2.3, there was no issue. The issue appeared
when upgrading to ICS (still with AnkiDroid 1.0) and is still there with the
latest beta (on ICS).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 931 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Sync JPG files to Dropbox as image resources for a deck
2. &quot;Download Missing Media&quot; on AnkiDroid
3. Receive error &quot;successfully retrived 0, missing 2&quot; on Ankidroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
That the media would download, however it does not successfully download. See Additional
Info.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Market v1.0

Please provide any additional information below.

This is not technically an AnkiDroid issue, I believe. However, a solution may be able
to be implemented in AnkiDroid if I am correct as to the cause. 

1) I assume AnkiDroid verifies correct download of media via a checksum method of some
type.
2) Many mobile carriers apply COMPRESSION to jpg images. T-Mobile does this. This is
100% beyond user control and is done on the network level.
3) Such compression will change the checksum of the file.
4) AnkiDroid will then see that the checksum of the file has failed when attempting
to download it.
5) PNG files are not affected as compression is only applied to JPG files - this is
confirmed as PNG resources download successfully. 

Possible Solution:
This solution is from Firefox, but may be applicable if done in AnkiDroid. Compression
may be prevented (on T-Mobile at least) if the HTTP Headers for the request include
specific values. 
Add the following 2 statements to the HTTP Get request:
Pragma no-cache
Cache-Control no-cache

I am not sure of the details of how this would be done, hopefully it's something not
done in an external library and can be done easily enough. All I know is that adding
these values on the desktop to the headers (via Firefox &quot;Modify Headers&quot; extension)
will prevent compression of JPG images.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 933 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Install Anki from Amazon marketplace on Kindle fire, and download a Japanese deck
(All I've tried so far. Same results on 6 different decks though, thought I wasn't
checking for this bug or anything, just pointing it out).
2. Interacting with the screen and the card, which I assume normally writes on the
whiteboard does nothing.
3. Similarly, you can pull up a menu while you're studying a deck, and see the options
such as clear whiteboard, but you cannot interact with any of the buttons.

This is on version 0.5.1 as downloaded from the Amazon marketplace for the kindle fire.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 939 Force AnkiDroid to use a particular font.

Point to clarify: Should it override the fonts of all decks? If not, how to distinguish?

Original request by robhol:
I'm having incredible problems with a relatively simple thing. Since a
lot of people use Anki to study Japanese, among other things, I'm sure
the issue of Han unification has been brought up before. (Kanji
looking significantly different between Chinese and Japanese and all
that jazz...)

I use a premade deck for kanji, and have desperately tried getting it
to show a proper, Japanese font, with no luck. I even installed Anki
for desktop, removed any font specified in the CSS for the deck, and
tried setting the font to two different ones from my computer. I made
sure to install the fonts in AnkiDroid's &quot;fonts&quot; folder, they're
selectable from the options menu, have the right filename, etc., and I
even set Default font to the same one, just for good measure.

The problem is... despite all of this, AnkiDroid STILL insists on
showing the kanji in what seems like the default font. I have no idea
why this is. Would it be okay to request a new feature? Completely
overriding the deck's choice of fonts? It could be something like
&quot;force default font&quot;, and would really help a lot.

On Android 1.5, when trying to add new cards, the keyboard always defaults to capital
letters, which make Ankidroid unusable on older phones/tablets. You'd have to tap shift
twice after every letter to enter anything. Please correct this bug, I'm sure it's
very easy to do, probably just using a different textInput method...

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 949 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. First copy than using the media files from the desktop decks on Ankidroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Sound files playing with normal speed


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
1.1beta2 on MIUI Android 2.3.7 (1.0 stable version had the same problem on y phone)


Please provide any additional information below.
The speed anki is playing the ogg-files is double or three times faster than normal.
In standard media player the speed is normal.
If there is a lot of audio files (actually some cards have sentences and up to 10 or
more audio files) the audio is playing without recogniseable order.
Sounds like some played at once.

I added to sound files. One recorded on the phone (soundtoofast) and one made with
audacity using the original file in the anki deck. Actually Anki desktop itself plays
it even slower, than audacity, so I have three different speeds. The Anki desktop version
is fitting my needs on the desktop, original files played with audacity is slightly
to fast for my taste and ankidroid playing it on the phone is unusable but I didn't
manage it to record it

However, Ankidroid is a great program!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 956 I'd think it would be a nice enhancement if you could sync a deck with changes in both
the server and device without having to choose either one or the other.

When there are changes in both side it tells you that the deck has been changed and
you have to choose one or the other and then you proceed to upload to server or download
from server the entire deck.

It'd nice if it could merge the changes (edited card, different study counts).

I think it was like this in the beginning. I don't know what happened.


Thanks for Anki and Ankidroid!!

You guys are doing the Lord's work.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 958 Hi, thank you for creating AnkiDroid. It is of really big use for me :)

Recently I renamed my decks to be prepared for Anki 2, now I am having trouble viewing
them related to the &quot;::&quot; inside the decks name. Also there seems to be a problem with
syncing.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create deck or rename it with name abc::def gh::ijkl
2. Download it with anki

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected: Name for deck would be abc::def gh::ijkl
Is: abcdef ghijkl (ghijkl might disappear if abcdef takes too much space)

Syncing-expected: deck is synced with correct name.
Syncing-is: deck is uploaded with wrong name.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

1.1beta5


Thank you very much for your work.

Best regards

Jonas

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 961 In the last beta versions I don't see a menu option at all when using AnkiDroid in my

The top bar that shows the name of the deck has gotten smaller. In the tablets, that
where the menu button goes, but now it has disappeared.

The change seems to be because of: e50cd84 - Added Google translate filter !
I guess it does some layout changes too, applying Holo theme to Android versions API
11 and higher.

As far as I know Holo theme is the Ice Cream Sandwich default theme, which should be
compatible with API versions 14 and up (11 and 12 being Honeycomb).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 962 In the latest betas, text labels for the answer buttons do not display in landscape
mode.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open Anki tutorial deck.
2. Rotate screen to landscape mode.
3. Click &quot;Show Answer.&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output: Answer buttons appear with &quot;Again,&quot; &quot;Good,&quot; &quot;Easy,&quot; and &quot;Very Easy&quot;
labels.
Actual output: Answer buttons appear with no text. (See attached screenshot.)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time. (The text labels appear as expected in portrait mode.)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 964 It would be nice if the special tags like “marked”, “leeched” etc. were translated,
and appear at the top of the tag selection list.

Anki does it like that (please see file), and therefore it is easier to select these
special tags. Right now, they somehow disappear in the tag selection list and are a
bit hard to find.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 966 When android is connected to internet via laptop (tethering) everything works just fine
except ankidroid:
got error message &quot;no internet connection&quot;.

I guess there is some stupid check for internet connection instead of actual connection
routine. This retarded check should be removed (or made optional if there is actually
some scenario when it could be useful).

Related bug - when this check fails ankidroid do not save login and password. This
is beyond stupidity: if user have entered some information it has to be saved regardless
of any kind of stupid checks. Always, I mean _always_ consider information entered
by user as highly valuable - don't just dump it becaue of some retarded useless check
has failed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 967 What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

After installing Anki 1.1 beta 5 on my Motorola Xoom MZ-601 (Honeycomb 3.2) the Notification
area didn't show anything but the clock-battery-network icons. Usually it shows information
from installed apps down there - such as System Monitor, Sipdroid status and Easy Battery
Saver.
Restarting apps/rebooting the Tablet has no effect - the notifications won't show up
as usual.

Additionally in Anki I can't access any settings, it always opens the last deck I had
open before upgrading, no way out.

Anyway, thanks for the great work so far,
Kashi K.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 969 by greta.elisif:

I’d like night-mode with some options, especially since my eyes are very sensitive
to bright light. I see some apps on my Kindle have a night-mode with white text on
a black background. This may be popular (not sure) but the white color is still bright,
there’s a lot of contrast, and white on black is just hard to make out and so is unsuited
for reading for more than a short period of time. The net effect is is still significant
eye-strain. Thus, what I think would cause the least eye-strain at night would be black
on dark gray. Of course, it would need to be tested in the dark in order to have the
right amount of contrast. So maybe a couple of night-modes would be a good idea, or
maybe just having several colors available for background and text. I’d like to nominate
besides black and white, cream, navy blue (i.e. a dull, dark blue), dark green, maroon,
light gray, and dark gray.

It would be nice if there was a way to reset a deck.  Sometimes I start a deck and
get half-way and then don't come back to it for a while.  If that happens then I have
to review 500 words to get back on track.  In order to reset and start over I have
to export the deck, re-import it, and then delete the old one.  It would be nice if
there were an option just to reset and start the deck fresh again.  Thanks!  Love this
program!!!!

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
I think it is 1.1 or 1.5. (I've taken it off now) the beta version it asks you to update
to.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

Recently ankidroid is not able to load my deck (attached) anymore, it is a quiet
big deck with Chinese characters and audiofiles. Opening of the deck
works however as soon as I want to start learning or show the cards of
the desk ankidroid crashes. When restarting it tells me that the file
is in a wrong format. Ankidroid is not able to repair it.

On the desktop version on Linux and Windows there is no problem with
the deck.

Is there any possibility I can check the deck for possible errors or
get an more detailed error message of ankidroid?

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 978 Please explain your idea here.

Card browser tends to be awfully slow to both open and search with big decks (10000+
cards ends up in 20+ seconds loading, and ~5 second lags when typing text as it tries
to update search results on the fly).
This makes it a pain in the ass to edit/unsuspended any card (esp. when one has been
suspended and I want to reactivate it, there is no other choice than go through card
browser).
IMO unsuspending or small editing a card through search is a frequent use case, and
should be privileged over &quot;browsing&quot; this huge list of card.

Maybe for decks with more than 5000 cards, a different approach would be more useful:
- Do not preload all the card in UI. Anyway, with 5000+ cards, user is never going
to scroll them but stick with search. This will save 30+ seconds everytime I open it.
Since there is a DB, search will still be fast with almost instant opening time.
- Search results should not be updated at almost every keypress but maybe only user
press a &quot;search&quot; button (or alternatively only if user doesn't input anything for a
few seconds?).

In this end I hope those changes would make card browser much more usable.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 979 By BodeyBaker:

I had a really odd issue the other day that could be related [to issue #380].

I was on a plane, put the phone into aeroplane mode, turned it off, and at the allowed
time, turned it on to fill my time with anki reviews. They were all listed as 0 reviews
due. This was clearly odd. I tried turning aeroplane mode off and taking out my sim
card to see if it was related to that. No dice. Then I put in my sim card. Still no
change. So I put it back on aeroplane mode and turned it off. When we landed, I turned
on the phone and the reviews were there. I'd say this sounds more like someone scared
witchcraft than a real bug report, but then the same thing happened on the return flight.
Any ideas?

This was clearly odd. = This was clearly wrong.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 982 Pressing show answer causes the display of the other side of the card to be from the
bottom when it takes up more than the screen can show. Previously the behaviour was
to line the top of the card up with the top of the screen. I'd argue that behaviour
is better but really it's beside the point. The more important problem is that there
doesn't appear to be an option to change this in the Display options.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 984 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. create a card and insert an image
2. mess with the filepath of the image (image already existing, anki appends (1) to
filename, remove the original file and rename the duplicate, sync, try to add the image
back)
3. remove the image from the card
4. sync
5. try to add the image back to the card

The image should be displayed in the add card interface.
But all i get is a file icon.

if i rename the picture, same empty file icon.
if i move the picture and change filepath, same empty file icon

the only way to fix this is to EDIT the image and change a few pixels.

As if anki kept a hash of the picture even after the card has been edited and saved
to remove any reference to that picture.

using latest stable release for windows.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 991 Hi,

I'm studying 2 foreign languages at the moment, and it would be cool, if the decks
could be somehow grouped to get separate aggregate stats, i.e. I could somehow switch
that now I work with language 1 and I see only decks and statistics from lang 1 and
the same for lang 2.

I guess the use cases could be similar for many other people who use it for studying
language and some other topic at the same time.

Thanks,

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 992 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Deselect “Next review time” in options
2. Learn a card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The “show answer” button is large, so that it is easy to press. But the “again“, ”good”
etc. buttons are smaller, because the next interval is not shown. Therefore, it is
not consistently in the size. It is not really hard to press, but it is a little bit
inconsistent. It would be nice if it were the same size. 

Please also look at the attached screenshots.

At least I hope that it is a bug, not a feature ;)

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? v.1.1 beta12

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 993 It would be nice if one could make simple text formatting with Ankidroid, e.g. italics,
bold etc.

Maybe it could be implemented in the long click dropdown menu (where copy, cut etc.
is located). So after you select a text in the card editor, and you want to make it
italic or bold or underlined, you make a long click and then select italic. After that,
the html code for italics will be wrapped around the selected text, just like in Anki
desktop.

For larger screens (e.g. tablets), the space may be sufficient to make seperate buttons
for it, in order to save time when wanting to have something in italics.


I don't know if this is possible in the Android toolkit, but it would be nice if the
input fields already displayed html (like in Anki), so that one can see different fonts
and formatting and pictures etc. already in the fact editor.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 994 Please add feature to import cards from text files / csv files present on the phone
storage, rather than having to import cards only through the &quot;.anki&quot; format. This adds
a lot more flexibility to the app. I've noticed that the app, &quot;iFlashCards&quot; has this
option, and I find it invaluable.

2) Click &quot;handwriting&quot; for any field
3) A whiteboard-like mode starts, write a word (kanji or any text)

5) A card is created containing OCRed text, translated text, and maybe the image

Kanji handwriting recognition is available as a part of the open source dictionary
Aedict.
Actually, this feature might be achieved by using both Aedict and AnkiDroid, but a
tighter integration would be needed to make it fast to enter many cards this way.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1001 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Add big widget to home screen

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected error is for a nicely formatted widget to open.  I initially receive an
error alert and then a misformatted widget.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Each time that I try to add the widget to the home screen the same issue occurs

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
1.1 latest version as per yesterday (6th of February)

I have attached screenshots of the error and the resultant widget.  This is occurring
on an Asus Transformer Prime with Ice Cream Sandwich.
If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1007 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Add a card from cellphone and sync the deck to desktop Anki
2. Perform a search from Anki

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- The card cannot be found. It's still there when you review the deck, but it just
cannot be found through searching

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
- It can be reproduced every time but with following exceptions:
1. After you edit the card on Anki, it can be found again
2. I've only tested this on a Chinese system with cards containing Chinese characters

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)
- Tried it on v1.0 and v1.1beta12

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android version)
- v2.3.4

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1010 Firstly, please add the feature to be able to import cards from text files. Many apps,
have it built in. iFlashCards, AnyMemo.

On phones, to edit text files, tab-separatds and csv formats are very tedious to edit
using a text editor.

Here, it would make sense to be able to import cards from text files where the de-limiter
is a new-line.

This feature is present in an app called,  &quot;iFlashCard&quot; available on the Android market.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1013 This is related to http://code.google.com/p/anki/issues/detail?id=2928 .

I don't have a way to repro but maybe someone who knows the code will easily think
why this happened.

I have a deck that I use only the phone but edit on the desktop. I suspended a card
on the phone. After unsuspending on the desktop, it was in an inconsistent state that
made it show over and over (see the bug above for more info).

Looking at an old back from before it was suspended I see

sqlite&gt; select type, relativeDelay, priority, successive from cards where question
like &quot;%control%&quot;;
1|1|2|8

which is all good.

Looking at the old backup on my phone I see


sqlite&gt; select type, relativeDelay, priority, successive from cards where question
like &quot;%control%&quot;;
1|0|-3|8

I think this is incorrect because when anki desktop unsuspends a card, it sets type=relativeDelay
(decks.py:unsuspendCards). That gives the card a type=0 (which indicates a fail) but
successive=8 (which indicates correct 8 times in a row).

I don't know how the 0 vs 8 happened. It probably involved me doing

1 fail card
2 undo fail so I can
3 suspend card

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1018 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Complete all the reviews due for the day in one deck.
2. Exit out of Ankidroid.
3. Enter Ankidroid again.
4. Click the 'Start Reviewing' button on that same deck, anticipating the 'Reviews
completed' menu to appear (Review early, learn more etc.)
5. Ankidroid crashes.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
'Reviews completed' menu should appear, but instead I get the 'Force Close' screen.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Everytime.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1019 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open up a deck (the one I used has limit options already set)
2. Hit the 'limit' button above cram
3. The tag selection dialog opens up under the limit dialog, so when trying to change
tags for the checkboxes, the dialog fails to open.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I was expecting the dialog to be hidden until I tried to select different tags, and
for it to appear above the limit learning dialog.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

If I close the limit learning dialog, then I can close the tag selection dialog under
it. Then if I hit the limit button again, everything works as you'd expect.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

4.0.2


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

I've attached a screenshot of what's happening to explain things better.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1022 The introductory deck is mostly translated, but the countries afterwards are not translated.
(e.g. “Egypt” should be “Ägypten” in German, and “Cairo” should be “Kairo”.)

Unfortunately, it is not listed in crowdin. It would be nice if these strings would
appear there as well.

Also, maybe make the name of the ”tutorial” deck translatable as well: in German e.g.
”Einführung” oder something like that.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1023 I have checked the points on the help page. I'm using Win7.
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have tried copying same file from phone to computer (and in reverse) 
2. Numbers don't change - error continues
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Count should be the same on both devices, desktop (v 1.2.8) is always higher.
??POSSIBLY ankidroid does not count suspended cards and desktop does?

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? Always.  Occurs with new Beta android version also.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)   1.1 beta 14 (also occurred on previous version)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)   2.3.6 (but also occurred on previous android phone ??1.3.5??

Does not crash, doesn't appear to effect functioning - just causes me to wonder if
my sync failed in some way.

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1024 
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a new card file on the computer
2. Create &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot; cards
3. On both cards, add a link that will look up the word on the internet
4. Sync with the Android
5. While reviewing, edit a card on the Android
6. The link on the &quot;reverse&quot; card disappears (while the link on the &quot;forward&quot; card
is fine)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
-- Editing the contents of the fields should not affect the card layout. I would expect
the card layout to remain unchanged.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Please provide any additional information below.
-- I'm afraid to make any changes on my Android copy for fear of losing the card layout.
Please look into this and try to reproduce the issue with the attached file.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1026 I am using the font Cardo(attached) for several of my shared decks, as it is the best
font for displaying mixed English-Hebrew or English-Greek cards.

The two screenshots show that the lines overlap when using Cardo, but not when using
Ezra SIL (nor when using the system font). 

I am using AnkiDroid v1.1beta17. I am currently using Android 2.3.7 (Cyanogen-Mod-7.1.0-Desire),
but the problem also occurred on Android 2.2.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1029 What steps will reproduce the problem?

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
expected = same schedule as that in ankidroid 2
instead = the schedule has not changed at all, in ankidroid I have already done 2 weeks
of studying, in anki2 desktop my schedule is still is stuck in day1.

I tried copying the file from desktop to my smartphone (I just opened the collection
in the desktop to see schedule without doing any studying) and the schedule is fine
on ankidroid, I tried copying the same collection to another android device and the
schedule is fine, the problem is only when I open it on the desktop anki2.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1030 After I updated my Asus Transformer to Android 4.0.3 I encountered a few Problems:

1. The buttons on the right top side (back, erase drawings, options, etc.) most of
the time don't show up when reviewing cards. A few times they were visible, but then
the remaining cards area on the upper left side disappeared (happened only a few times).


2. When drawing on the screen the programm lags sometimes. The lines don't show up
for about a second and then suddenly pop up.

3. Anki lags sometimes when pushing some buttons like &quot;show answer&quot;. 


Android Version: 1.0

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1032 I see that google translate just recently made an option to show more detailed translation
in it's android app. However, sharing option does not share all the data, only part
of it. Is it that google does not share this extended data through intent? Because
if it does, it would be great to add those to the cards too.

Alternatively, there is an app dictionary.com which has awesome descriptive monolingual
interpretations of words... Couldn't those be transferred to ankidroid as well? (sharing
intents was available only through &quot;mail&quot; there. However the &quot;Any memo&quot; app could catch
it from there (email intent). I wouldn't switch to it because of this, but mentioning
it just because it may sound more realistic to implement)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1038 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck with an ampersand in the name with the desktop software.
2. Sync it with ankiweb.net.
3. Download it to AnkiDroid.
4. Select 'Sync all' in AnkiDroid.

What is the output?
It duplicates the deck on ankiweb.net, omitting the ampersand in the duplicate's name.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It is reproduced every time, with different names that include ampersands.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1041 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open AnkiDroid
2. Choose deck
3. Complete repetition.
4. Choose another deck.
5. Start repetition.
6. Progress bars in upper right corner have green borders.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Bar border should remain intact.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1044 When displaying a card, use a random font (from all system fonts, or from all fonts
in the &quot;fonts&quot; directory, or a selection, I haven't thought about the details)

Rationale:
- I am using Anki to recognize Japanese characters accurately
- The font of an Anki card's question is not something you usually change often
- In real life there are lots of Japanese fonts, and sometimes I lack reading speed
reading kanjis in a special font, whereas I would have no problem if it were my usual
font.

I want to train at recognizing a character in any font, not train at recognizing a
character in a particular font.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1045 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create card with RTL text in a certain field (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.)
2. Edit that card and try to modify that field.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
There is a circular button in the field box on the right that appears to create a strikethrough
for the field's text. If the text is right-to-left (RTL), it is superimposed on this
button and it is difficult to edit the field text.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens everytime.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? v1.0

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1047 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Creating a deck with an apostrophe in the name on another version (desktop or web).
2. Download deck to Ankidroid.
3. Sync deck back up.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
You would expect the deck to sync across the board, but because Ankidroid does not
support the apostrophe, it creates additional deck on the site.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every single time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1051 I often use text selection during review to look up words in a dictionary..
But this doesn't work as long as the whiteboard is enabled since it's grabbing the

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1052 When in cram mode, the session limits for reviews are applied, thus stopping after the
time or the card limit.

I assume this is an unwanted behaviour, since it's inconsistent with the desktop version
of Anki. If not, AnkiDroid should not disable the 'limit' button.

This was tested using AnkiDroid 1.1.

I get the dialog for choosing the language for the deck and after that there is a play

If I enable the &quot;Play Sounds Instantly&quot; option, the sound is played instantly as expected,
but the button still doesn't react on tapping. 

The problem only occurs on my ASUS Transformer TF-101 tablet with Android 4.0.
On my ZTE Blade Smartphone with Android 2.3 the play button works as expected.

Most times. This used to happen before the update as well, but usually only once. If
you tried to open the deck a second time it would always work. Now the deck picker
reloading when selecting a deck often happens multiple times in a row, which is somewhat
annoying.

1. Select &quot;type answers&quot; in preferences.
2. Start review with a deck where cardmodel does not specify an answer.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
You are prompted for an answer. If I wanted to be prompted for
an answer in this deck, I would have specified it in the card model.

I know that this behavior is intended, but it's anoying. I review three decks every
day and I have to switch this preference if I change the deck. I have also a deck where
for some cards I have an answer specified and for other cards not.

This patch fixes the error. (The info text in preferences needs to be changed too)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1064 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Stepping into Card Browser
2.Pressing Add in order to Add new card, completing it and pressing add button
3.Stepping back to the Card Browser

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: The new item is added to the list
Experienced: The list is not updated. You have to leave Card Browser, step back into
it and then you can see the updated list.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

AnkiDroid v1.1

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

2.3.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1066 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.You add new card and fill front and back sides and save it
2.Start reviewing
3.On the added card the back side became the question and the front is the answer 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
EXPECTED: The front is the question and the back is the answer. 
EXPERIENCED: The back is the question, and the front is the answer. So I have to cut
and paste to settle it. I did not use the swap Q/A feature at all. Sometimes the card
is inserted properly but most of the time it swapped. If this swap would be changeless
than I would get used to the fact that the back is the question but than again the
back is the answer and I have to copy and past (since the questions are on the back
of most of my cards already). 
I also experienced a strange behavior with previous version (AnkiDroid-1.0alpha3.apk):
the card is mixed up and I edit only one character and after saving it the problem
is solved. Unfortunately it does not always work so I have to use cut/paste again.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Using certain deck the problem is absolutely reproducible, but when I create a new
deck then everything is fine. Therefore I think this issue is probably card related.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1069 Hi

If card model contains more fields, which are then respectively shown on the card,
content of those fields is also shown in the card browser.

Front side:
{{question}}
{{verb_type}}

Back Side:
{{Tibetan}} ( using tib font )
{{answer}}   (transcription using latin script}}
{{Honorific}} (alternate version, more polite )

currently in card browser for question is shown:
{{english}}{{verb_type}}
for answer
{{Tibetan}}{{wylie}}{{Honorific}} 

Proposal:
setting that would &quot;force&quot;
only field &quot;question&quot; to be shown in card browser as question and
     field &quot;answer&quot;   to be shown as answer.

this could lead to much better display where not so many data are shown in card browser,
but only the most important ones.

Best Regards

Marek

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1082 First of all I want to thank you for the great work on ankidroid 2.0, can't wait for
it to be officially released :) I am using it both on samsung galaxy i5500 and coby
kyros 7016. Regarding the syncing, I find that copying the anki2 files to the mydocuments&gt;anki&gt;user1
folder works instead of placing it on mydocuments&gt;anki alone, though I have not tried
synching it on the cloud.

However here are a couple of issues I found with the latest release:

1) notes that have the words whites or blacks are displayed as codes such as #000000
or #ffffff (ie &quot;White patients are more prone to...&quot; is displayed as &quot;#ffffff patients
are more prone to....&quot;

2) version16 won't install if I have a previous ankidroid2.0 on my gadget (I used version
14 before), I have to uninstall the old version before the new version can be installed

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1083 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a desk and format single words with a color. This will show as hex-code in
the html command
2. Export the desk (via sync or manually copy/paste) to ankidroid. The fonts display
in standard color only.
3. When formatting the text in plain-text colors (lightblue, purple, green etc.) in
ankidroid, this will display correctly.
4. But when exporting desks from desktop to ankidroid, color formats (entered in plain-text
in desktop version) will change to hex-code and again display in standard color.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the text to display in the color I chose in anki desktop.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes, it happens every time. Ankidroid seems to correct plain-text color commands correctly,
but not hex-code colors.


AnkiDroid v1.1
Android 2.3.5


Please either make export of plain-text colors from desktop to ankidroid possible,
or allow ankidroid to read hex-code colors and display correctly. thanks very much!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1090 As discussed in issue 792, it seems that Veecheck is not needed anymore, thanks to BroadcastMessages.

We should remove it because it requires &quot;start at boot&quot; permission, and increases complexity.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1093 It is only a minor issue.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Become offline.
2. Press &quot;Sync all&quot; button (a message that you are currently offline is displayed).
3. Try to press &quot;Sync all&quot; again (even if already online).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
A message about being offline should be displayed again (or should synchronize while
being already online). Currently a &quot;Sync all&quot; button is inactive (there is no reaction
on clicking).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
AnkiDroid 1.1, Android 2.3.4.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

First of all i would like to appreciate your efforts on this handy application.
And then may i ask you that is it possible to have a custom selected cards learning?
I mean that you select one or more cards in card browser and start learning that cards.
You know i'm aware of tags and related features but for example you decided to have
some cards with different tags to learn.

Thank you so much.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1104 Hi,

I have a very strange error in Ankidroid that I really don't understand.  When I edit
the keyword in my &quot;Kanji - Jap&quot; deck, the card somehow becomes associated with the
wrong template.  These are the precise steps to replicate - 

In Ankidroid - 

1. Open Kanji - Jap deck
2. Start the review
3. Select Edit card from Menu
4. Make any change to the keyword property
5. Save changes
6. You will be taken back to the review session, but the card will have flipped sides
and will be using the template from the &quot;Kanji - Eng&quot; deck (presumably)

The only way I have found to fix this card at this point is to
1. Load the card in Windows Anki.
2. Edit the keyword and save
3. The card will flip back to the correct template.

I have uploaded the two decks (the only two decks I have loaded into Ankidroid).  If
you view the Kanji - Jap deck and have a look at the card with the keyword of &quot;tranquillizes&quot;
you can observe that this card is flipped around the wrong way from the rest of the
card.  This is because I edited the Keyword in Ankidroid as above.

I am surprised this has not been picked up before because it seems a serious error,
which makes me think it is just me.  It has occured for me since I started using Ankidroid,
and as a result I only can edit cards using Anki.

My specs 
Samsung Galaxy S2
Stock ROM LA4 
Rooted 
Ankidroid 1.1
Android 2.3.6

Good luck with this one and thanks for your assistance!

Regards,
Lloyd

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1105 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. In deck preferences click &quot;new Cards&quot; then &quot;Steps in minutes&quot;
2. Give in a few intervals, like &quot;1 15 60 120&quot; for example
3. During study in a few minutes a card can progress through well beyond its timing.

In my opinion with respect to efficiency and time saving it would be better if these
timing periods would be kept literally. If I click on &quot;30 minutes&quot; I should see that
card in 30 minutes.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1108 Sharing a deck with classmates is not as convenient as it could be.
Scenario:
1) Student S1 writes flashcards during class, during lunch break, or before the exams.
2) During lunch break or similar, student S2 expresses interest for the flashcards
3) S1 puts phone in sending mode for a given tag
4) S2 puts phone in receiving mode
5) Transmission (excluding progress information)
6) S2 now can review the flashcards S1 created

Maybe it should be both-ways, for instance when students collaborate, for example:
S1 makes flashcards for grammar points, S2 makes flashcards for new words.

Just upgraded both the alpha version and the new anki beta 4 version. I was already
having trouble with syncing from ankidroid prior to updating either, and often it would
simply be in the middle of syncing and crash. I already submitted the error log code
for that instance before. Also, I'm positive it's not the updated beta version of full
Anki because I updated ankidroid prior to updating Anki and that is when the problem
first started. I had hoped updating Anki might solve the issue.

Also, on a side not, the Night mode does not work anymore either.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1116 These steps will reproduce the problem:
1.Create a deck with a long name (&gt; 40 char)through the desktop app or some other means.
The cutoff in the Linux Desktop app appears to be 130 while the Windows Desktop app
only allows for 50 characters.
2.Sync the deck to ankidroid
3.Add a card
4.Sync again

Expected a normal sync of any changes made to the deck. Instead Ankidroid seems to
truncate the deck name, the new shorter name does not match the one stored at ankiweb
so when it syncs it does so as a new deck.

Originally I discovered this with a deck named &quot;Electronic Devices and Circuits Vol
1 chp 2&quot; I confirmed it using one named &quot;01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789&quot;

I have version 1.1 of AnkiDroid which I just installed a few days ago from Google Play.

I am using Android 2.3.5 on a Samsung Statosphere model SCH-I405.

This is not a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; type problem.

This is all the information I can think to send.  Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1118 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open &quot;add card&quot; dialogue.
2. Put your phone in landscape mode so that the keyboard uses the entire screen.
3. After typing into the first field, press &quot;next&quot; on the on screen keyboard.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The cursor should jump to the next field. Instead, nothing happens. This is really
inconvenient if you add a card in landscape mode and the keyboard uses the entire screen,
because you always have to press the back key to close the keyboard and then go to
the next field manually.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 
Ankidroid 1.1

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1119 I have a deck with the following fields:

1. French
2. German
3. Audio

Then I created three templates like this:

1.
{{French}}
--
{{German}}
{{Audio}}

2.
{{German}}
--
{{French}}
{{Audio}}

3.
{{Audio}}
--
{{French}}
{{German}}


The first two cards will always be created, because you usually always type in the
German and French fields. But the Audio field is sometimes empty.
Anki Desktop only creates a card if the question field is not empty. So in this case,
if Audio is empty, only two cards are created.

It would be really nice if Ankidroid could do this, too. You can deselect the third
templates, but you forget this sometimes or rather you forget to activate it again
(and then you wonder why you don't have the third card anymore). 

I guess it would be quite easy: Just check if the front page of a card/template is
empty, and if yes, don't create that particular card.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1120 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. I click on &quot;start review&quot; and the screen blinks shortly than throws me back on the
previous screen. (Naturally, it's not because there is nothing to review...)

It happens every time. The last time Ankidroid worked for me was version &quot;Alpha 16&quot;.
(Back than even &quot;night mode&quot; worked fine. But it's downhill ever since.)

Incidentally, I use it on &quot;s. Galaxy S Plus&quot;

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1121 Please explain your idea here.

On AnkiDroid, all text in the flash cards is center aligned. My goal is to make them
left aligned. I'm looking for a solution that does not involve editing each card. For
example, a new setting to make the text left aligned. I'm interested in this because
many of my card answers are JavaScript code code and do not look right when center
aligned.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

This page mentions that it is possible on Anki Desktop, but I haven't been able to
follow the steps. http://groups.google.com/group/ankisrs/browse_thread/thread/313b88a1b25dea77

1. Enable &quot;Zeemote JS1 support&quot; under Preferences-&gt;Navigation
2. select a deck to review
3. results in force close
(FYI - a Zeemote is already paired with the device, and works fine with AD 1.1.  Problem
occurs whether the Zeemote is off or on)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
would love for Zeemote to work as well with AD2.0 as it does with AD1.1

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
every time, very repeatable for several versions of the 2.0 alpha  (perhaps all?)

Keep up the good work!  I can't wait to use Zeemote with the new new Learning mode

2. Download deck-&gt;Shared deck

I expect to see a form to pick up a new deck. I get error:
&quot;Attention! A network error has occurred. Retry, or cancel and return to the previous
screen.&quot;

I'm using AnkiDroid v1.1.1 on a horrible abomination of ICS 4.0.3 done by Samsung,
on Samsung Galaxy SII. My phone is rooted.

Please provide any additional information below.
On my previous phone (also Samsung Galaxy SII, running the latest CM9), previous version
of AnkiDroid worked fine. However, that phone was stolen, and in the meantime this
new version arrived, but I don't know if this matters.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1132 Hi,

currently the anki session stops, when the cards where i pressed &quot;again&quot; are displayed
one secound time.

I would prefer a behavior, where the learning session does not stop (before timeout),
when there are cards left, where i pressed again. 

This would help to learn completely new facts - this cards would be displayed again
and again - until either the timeout knocks in or i press some other button than again
for the first time.

what do you think?

regards

Markus

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1136 If the user has no widgets and notifications set to never, AnkiDroid should not be running.
While it is up to the OS whether to stop the application or not, we should make sure
we do not keep it running longer than we need to.
For example, we should disable the BOOT_COMPLETED receiver if notifications are set
to never.
Moreover, we should not started the service to update the widget if there is no widget.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes

Desktop: windows version of Anki2 beta 9

Problems: (alpha28)
1.) It is still displayed as alpha27
2.) night mode still does not work
3.) cloze made with the new anki2 beta works intermittently; ie I open a deck, it shows
a couple of questions, but goes back to the deck screen. for some decks it won't even
start the learning process at all
4.) I sync my deck by copying via usb; the dates don't update at all. ie I made changes
via desktop at 12nn, I then studied at 4pm using my tablet, but the time doesn't update,
so when I copy the deck back to the desktop or other android devices the date/time
is still stuck at 12nn, instead of 4pm

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1139 AnkiDroid defaults to disabling type in the answer by default, even if it's on in the
desktop, which has resulted in a number of posts on the forums and this issue tracker
from people who didn't know how to enable it. While I personally hate typing on touchscreen
keyboards, I think typing the answer should be on by default if the user has enabled
it in their desktop reviews.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1144 The progress bars are useful for gauging one's performance and increase the motivation
to review.

But, they slow down the opening screen of the deck and in the case of the tablet format
reduce the responsiveness of the app.

Let's provide an option to toggle them on/off for those that can/can't afford the slow
down respectively.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1149 There are great shared decks for download which contain thousands of facts. You can
sort them by &quot;Created&quot; so the easiest (or most common) words come first. This is a
useful kind of sorting for such decks, learning the easy ones first and the more advanced
later.

However, many of them contain the forward cards only. Using Anki Desktop, you can add
the reverse cards easily. However, this means that all the reverse cards are created
after the forwards cards. So, sorting by &quot;Created&quot;, Anki would present you all forward
cards before you can start with the newly created reverse cards.

The Desktop version solves this by having an additional sort option &quot;Fact Created&quot;.
Ankidroid is lacking this option. You can swap Q/A but you are correctly warned not
to do so because it messes up the tracking of learning progress.

I could also imagine something like a &quot;stick new cards of the same fact together&quot; option
which then works for all kinds of sorting. This option would be applied for selecting
new cards only. After being presented to the user for the first time, the usual algorithms
take over.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1150 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use Android 4
2. Open some deck
3. Select Night mode (optional)
4. Press &quot;Show answer&quot;

What is the expected output?

Answer appears on the screen directly.

A white screen appears for about 0.3 - 0.5 seconds until the answer is shown.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time. I recently updated to Android 4.0 and was quite surprised the UI looks
so different there (not sure if the fact that you almost always, depending on your
deck name, can't read the &quot;minutes remaining&quot; part is worth another issue..).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1156 In Preferences &gt; Display, alongside &quot;Show timer&quot; and &quot;Show progress bars&quot;, I'd really
like the option to show / hide the &quot;Remaining&quot; card numbers: The Red, Black and Blue
numbers which denote failed, pending and new cards for review.

The reason for this is that quite often looking to see which of the three piles the
current card falls into (denoted by a line under either the red, black or blue number),
gives me a hint as to whether I &quot;should&quot; know the card or not.

E.g., if my eyes flick up and notice I'm looking at a New card, I find I give up more
easily, only to find that, when I look at the answer, it was something I would have
got if I'd just tried a bit harder.

This is a problem reviewing on desktop Anki as well, but it's more of an issue on my
phone, since the smaller screen means it's easier to glance at the numbers intentionally
or otherwise. And since I do pretty much 100% of my reviewing on Ankidroid nowadays,
it would be great if I could have the option to switch off this sneaky mental prompt!

Many thanks for such a great project!

So I can't study card.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

30-40% on studying card.
but 10-13 cards -&gt; every time back to study option.



What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 
AnkiDroid-1.1.2.apk 

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android 
2.3.5

I uses this android machine.

http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/kyobo

5.7” XGA format (1024 x 768 pixels) 
mirasol display (screen resolution of 223 ppi)
Qualcomm’s 1.0 GHz Snapdragon™ S2 class processor
 Kyobo’s custom application interface sits atop an Android 2.3 base




If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1160 Please explain your idea here.
in a deck, if i just want to study a tag, i have to use cram, which doesn't give 20
new cards per day or so. I want to be able to learn new cards with tag just like in
desktop version, please help

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1163 ## What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install my shared deck 9fe67737c7a5a5a2 (which includes some audio and text from
www.book2.de)
2. Try to review it in Ankidroid v1.1.2 on a Pulse Mini running Android 2.1-update1

## What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect the first card's question to speak the following using audio, &quot;Arabic واحد
(in a male voice) واحد (in a female voice) in Bengali&quot; and to display the following
text: &quot;Arabic: ‪]‬واحد‪[‬ 1 In Bengali ...&quot;

Instead, no audio plays at all, and of the text, only the bits in English are displayed,
plus the text &quot;sound:ar0001.mp3&quot; and some square brackets and some little black-bordered
white rectangles.

## Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

## What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

v1.1.2

## On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

2.1-update1

## If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1164 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review with Ankidroid
2. Occasionally deck will break.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect reviewing to happen regularly.  Sometimes The deck will get in such a state
where I can answer a card and that same card will come up again. I can answer it again
and it comes up again.  This repeats forever.  If I try to open the same deck on anki
desktop, it gives a message  that shows it is corrupt (error dialog attached).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?  Not sure what causes it.  It happens sporadically.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

Ankidroid v 1.1.2
Windows Anki 1.2.8

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

Please provide any additional information below.


A deck in the broken state is available here:

Windows error message when trying to open linked file is attached as screenshot.

Let me know if I can give any more information about my setup.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1169 Many users have restarting sync-at-close, a feature that is available on Desktop.

Problem: Android does not really have the notion of closing apps. When AnkiDroid is
closed, it is already too late to sync.

Proposed solution: Sync after AnkiDroid has not been used for 2 minutes or something.

Should be optional and disabled by default, of course.
No confirmation dialog.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1174 I read all the reasons why you shouldn't reset a deck but it's simply the decision of
the student if he wants to waste his time learning stuff he might not have forgotten
yet.

That said let me state my situation:
I studied Japanese 2 years ago and my deck had 400 in it. I recently decided to get
back to it, but now have all the cards for review while I know almost none of them
anymore PLUS if I DO know one it schedules the next review for 1 year into the future,
even if it was a lucky guess.

This is discouraging and the reason why I've been wasting my time looking for a solution
instead of learning.

Please add this feature; people will appreciate and those who don't just won't use
it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1175 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Begin to review deck
2. Before Answering, rotate the device so the screen goes into landscape mode
3. Rotating back to original position does it again

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The question should not be skipped, ie, it should ask the same question. Rather, the
next question shows up if the device is rotated, and it treats it as if &quot;Good&quot; was
selected

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Happens consistently, every time

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1177 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1.Open the deck

2.Do a few reviews

3.As usual, click any of the four buttons in order to finish current card and proceed
to the next

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected: The program properly goes to the next card and keep working

Instead: As normal, the clicked button is highlighted while others are darkened. However
the program would not proceed. Instead it just stucks at the same card interface. Clicking
menu or back etc. won't help. From the task manager it is seen that the RAM usage of
Ankidroid doesn't change much(fluctuates around 0.x MBs). Occasionally(not in all cases)
a window pops out, saying &quot;Activity Reviewer is not responding, Force Close/Wait&quot;.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every six to seven cards or so.

I figure it's just the same as Issue 277: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=277,
which was already declared as &quot;FixedInDev&quot; in version 0.6. However, it reappeared...

I'm learning in one direction with a deck of approximately 1500 words presently. Deck
created and modified only on PC.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1179 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1.  The text should be in a color other than white.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using?  **I don't have a choice of &quot;Menu&quot; from the
Decks list: Only &quot;Sync All&quot; and &quot;Statistics&quot;.  Couldn't find the AnkiDroid version.
But I downloaded it on 6/19/12. 

On what version of Android? 
** I don't have an &quot;Android Version&quot;, only a &quot;System Version&quot; (Blur_Version.0.40.0.MB502.Brasil.en.BR)
and a &quot;Firmware Version&quot; (2.1-update 1) and a &quot;Build Number&quot; (BASLA-U3_00.40.0.)

That does explain why I've been seeing Portugese words :-) 
The phone is a Motorola Charm.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1180 This affects Egyptian hieroglyphics. It might also affect some CJK characters on the
Supplementary Ideographic Plane, including some in modern use, but I haven't verified
that.

What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Install AnkiDroid 1.1.2 and Linux Anki 1.2.5. (I have no reason to believe that
the specific version numbers or the desktop OS affect this.)
2. Download the Aegyptus font package from http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ and install
Gardiner.ttf in /sdcard/AnkiDroid/fonts and on the desktop.
3. On the desktop, edit a card model to use the &quot;Gardiner&quot; font a specific field, and
insert U+1300 (a seated man). You can copy and paste from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs#Unicode
4. Sink everything to AnkiWeb, and notice that it works fine from a desktop browser.
5. Sink everything down to AnkiDroid and review the card containing U+1300.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

You should see the same hieroglyphic character that you see in Anki desktop and AnkiWeb.
Instead, you see six black diamonds containing a question mark and the hexidecimal
number &quot;FFFD&quot;.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

AnkiDroid 1.1.2

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

4.0.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

Thank you for such an excellent program!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1184 If you open the attached example deck (or another deck with a high res image) on your
phone, then you should notice the image is not scaled to suit the screen size, and
I need to pan to see the whole image. The same image is correctly scaled in ankidroid
1.

Also notice that the furigana is not displayed correctly on the answer side of the
card (it just shows gibberish). I suspect you already know about this problem so I
haven't submitted a separate error report.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1186 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Using the program :)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Before the upgrade to 4.0 on my phone, the buttons were nice and minimal. Now the answer
buttons, etc are HUGE taking up nearly 1/3 of my viewable area. They're so huge that
when using landscape mode the interface blocks most of the text. There is also now
the title of the deck and a forward and back button that wasn't there before. Basically
the whole interface is huge and cluttered suddenly.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens all the time, doesn't seem to be an option to make it any smaller as it's at
100% and can't go lower.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
AnkiDroid 1.1.3, Android 4.0.3

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following

report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
The option to reduce the button size to below 100% would be great, and/or to minimalize
the interface since phones are a small device.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1188 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a note with a field with ruby text
2. Enter some furigana using [ ... ] 
3. Review this card on Ankidroid 2.0

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

You should get nicely displayed furigana over the kanji, instead it shows numbers 1,
2, 3 randomly for both the kanji and the furigana.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

Ankidroid 2.0 alpha 45, Android 4.0.4 on a Galaxy Nexus.


I have included three screenshots that demonstrate what is happening.  The &quot;Question&quot;
side of the card, the answer with the corruption and the field as shown in the editor.

When I'm reviewing cards on AnkiDroid I'd like to mark some cards. I can see marked
cards list which is coloured in Card Browser (even there's option &quot;Show marked cards&quot;)
BUT this information about marked cards IS NOT SYNCING with &quot;Big&quot; Anki (v1.2.8).

The same is in the second way: marked cards in &quot;Big&quot; Anki are not synced and seen in
AnkiDroid.

Everytime. Only way to avoid the issue is to uninstall Ankidroid 1.1.3. This is immensely
frustrating for alpha testing as it would involve countless uninstall/reinstalls.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every time.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
On Android 2.3.7 as well as on Android 4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
Tried it on my mobile and my tablet with alpha 47 and 49 and neither does work.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1204 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. study new cards with a new card limit
2. suspend card during review instead of answering it

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

No new cards are pulled in to replace the suspended ones. So if I have a limit of 20
new cards and suspend 5 during the review, no additional 5 cards are added to the queue
to make up for it. Going back to the Deck Picker correctly fills the queue again and
I can re-enter the deck and study the 5 missing cards.

AnkiDroid 1 correctly refilled the queue on the spot.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1206 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have existing DeckA sync'd to AnkiDroid including media via dropbox (DeckA.media)
without issue
2. Create new DeckB on Anki Desktop, sync with AnkiWeb and DropBox (creating DeckB.media)
without issue
3. Attempt to download DeckB onto Ankidroid, deck downloads fine but attempts to download
media from DeckA.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect that the media from DeckB would be downloaded. Instead, gives me a &quot;Fetching
Missing Media Error with File: pasteglsete.jpg&quot; window. When I look up that file, it
is located in DeckA.media and should not be associated with DeckB.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time. If I add that single file via USB it will give me an error with
a different file from media.DeckA

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)
v1.1.3

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
2.3.6

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1208 this is a generic issue to mark bugs in triage which are probably related to corrupt
user dbs. The accordings crashes are catched and the user gets a message regarding

this should only be further investigated if it happens very often or if there is another
hint that it might be related to an AnkiDroid bug

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1218 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. To learn a new card, the normal side and reverse side are always adjacent to each
other.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I hope that they'll not come too close as it'll become harder to remember the reverse
side.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens everytime.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
2.0 beta 1. 2.0 beta 3
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

Android 4.0.4

Not force close.

Please provide any additional information below.
The new learn mode is much better than version 1.x. Please solve this small problem
and I think it's also a universal request, not by me alone. Thanks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1219 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. If there are few nested decks, for example Deck1::Deck2::Deck3 and Deck1::Deck2::Deck4,
and both Deck3 and Deck4 have cards to review (ex. 2 2 3 and 3 4 5)


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The summary beside Deck1 should show (5 6 8), but it shows (10 12 16) instead, apparently
summing up values for Deck3, Deck4 AND Deck2, thus doubling real quantity of cards.
This is an example pattern. If there is a deck at level Deck2, same applies to it.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Permanent effect

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1221 due to interdependencies with widget updating, the col fails sometimes to load when
ankidroid is started. this happens when widget and normal collection loading occurs
at the same time.

The widget checks if the collection is already open. If not, it opens the collection
and closes it after having fetched the information.

When the widget opens the collection before the normal col loading start, deckpicker
will just take the already opened collection and mark it as opened in order to prevent
the widget from closing it.

That's the basic idea, but sometimes the widget nevertheless closes the collection
although it's requested by deckpicker. In this case, deckpicker reports a db error.

The open collection method is a static synchronized method.

Any guess, why this happens? We should definitely solve this before releasing as it
tells users about corrupt dbs which are actually not.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1224 in order to improve the workflow of adding information from dictionaries, add an option
to add information automatically without opening ankidroid.

this could be done either by 
- adding it to the already existing save-for-later-db (this would not require the collection
to be opened and therefore much quicker)
- or by adding it directly to the collection (with a certain tag and/or to a certain
deck)

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1226 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have a deck in previous stable version of ankidroid with pictures in it. (Ultimate
Geography chosen here)
2. Upgrade to AnkiDroid2.0beta4
3. Browse the particular deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I should see pictures. I see the question mark, which was shown, when no media folder
for the deck was in previous version. I assume it's because the new collection file.
It probably did not upload the pictures. However I need them and there either is a
way how to do this (couldn't find any manual or something), or this is &quot;under construction&quot;.
If so, than I'll have to revert changes, I think, until this is fixed.

I also thought of downloading Anki Desktop 2.0 mentioned on the start of beta and see
if it would create a media file or folder on it's own, which I would copy then. Either
no such application exist (yet), or I'm kinda blind - couldn't find any.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Didn't try it again, I'm pretty sure it would happen again.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1227 Right now the widget can give an alarm but only when at least 10 cards have lined up.
I think there should be no such limitation. What if, for example, there are only 9
cards left to study? 

So in the options there should be an option with the following settings:

1, Turn on / off alarms
2, Every how many cards should an alarm be raised? (01-...)
For example, 1 would mean that with every additional card arriving in the waiting queue,
there is an alarm raised. Or every second, third, ect.
3, Should the program pop up automatically?
4, Or should it just indicate on the notification bar?
5, Costum sound option where you can choose your specific mp3 to play as anki warning
sign.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1229 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open deck and enable cram mode
2. Start reviewing
3. Answer a few questions
4. Perform an undo
5. Answer an undone question and enter how you did
6. Ankidroid dialog box pops up &quot;Saving...&quot; and takes longer than usual


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
1. Rather than saving and moving on, it opens another dialog box stating the deck's
corrupt and/or there's not enough space (but there is more than enough space) and asks
if I want to repair the deck
2. Attempt to repair the deck fails
3. Deck no longer is usable

It happened several times already. I wasn't sure what was causing it before, but I
knew it had something to do with cram mode.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1230 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Select &quot;Download deck&quot; from the menu
2. Select either &quot;Personal deck&quot; or &quot;Shared deck&quot;
3. Click on one of the decks
4. Force close

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It should download the deck.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
1.1.3

On what version of Android?
4.1.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Downloading personal or shared decks is the only sane way to get Anki decks on the
Nexus 7. Unfortunately, the device does not register itself as a mass storage device,
so it's tricky to get the decks onto it. I used a Dropbox workaround, but this is probably
too involved for beginners. I know you guys are concentrating on AnkiDroid 2 right
now, but the Nexus 7 is an incredible device for ankiholics and finally shipping in
large quantities.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1231 What steps will reproduce the problem?
I didn't find a way to reproduce the problem.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The correct number of due cards.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
The problem occurred twice so far while testing. I haven't imported any other decks
yet, so the tutorial deck is the only one affected (the Default deck doesn't have cards).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
2.0 beta 4, but I had this issue once in beta 3, too.

On what version of Android?
4.1.1, but I noticed the same problem on 2.2.1, too.

Please provide any additional information below.
Repairing the deck doesn't help. After doing some reviews, it will switch back to the
right number.
Any idea how to reproduce this?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1233 What steps will reproduce the problem?
0. Have a fresh installation of AnkiDroid
1. Select Default deck
2. Click on the &quot;Add card&quot; icon
3. Type something into the Front and Back field
4. Click on &quot;Add&quot;
5. Click on &quot;Start reviewing&quot;
6. After clicking on &quot;Show answer&quot;, select &quot;Good&quot;
7. The card will be shown again (cards to review: 1)
8. After doing the card again, it will show the Congratulations screen

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The review should be over after step 6. The answered card should be in the next day's
session.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
2.0 beta 4

On what version of Android?
4.1.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Maybe things changed in Anki 2, but this seems fishy to me.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1235 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review one deck on AnkiDroid with a wide screen, such as a tablet, sync.
2. Sync on another system. Review another deck, sync again.
3. Sync on the AnkiDroid device again.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The deck highlighted in the list on the left and the one shown in the overview on the
right should be the same.
Instead in the list the last deck active on the remote system is highlighted, on the
right the last deck you reviewed on this device is shown.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
AnkiDroid 2.0.beta6 on Android 4.0.3.

For extra nastiness, when you delete the deck on the other system, the right side shows
a non-existent deck after the sync. (For this you may have to force a full sync on
the remote system.)
Pressing &quot;Start Reviewing&quot; in this situation crashes AnkiDroid.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1242 What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
AnkiDroid v2.0beta6

On what version of Android?
2.2 and 4.1 (emulator)


Any elements that have been given a font-size style do not scale if using &quot;em&quot; as the
unit.
E.g,. 
.card
{
  font-size: 2em;
}

On the desktop client, the fonts in the card are scaled accordingly. On AnkiDroid,
they do not scale. Changing the &quot;Relative font size&quot; has no effect on the text size,
whether it's 10% or 150%.

Using pixels instead does indeed scale the text. I.e., the following does get scaled:
.card
{
  font-size: 25px;
}

The issue is present in cards where the usage of px and em is intermixed among different
elements, where those that use px are scaled, and those that use em are not.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1247 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set it up so cards use some specific bold fonts.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The fonts should appear bolded, like in the &quot;Sinngehalt_desktop.png&quot; images done with
the desktop client.. Instead they appear with a strange border effect, as seen in &quot;baumaterial_android.png&quot;

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens with some fonts and not with others.
But with those fonts, it happens all the time.

I am not 100% sure that it is related to otf fonts, but it appears that ttf-fonts are
bolded correctly and otf fonts are not.

In the image, the three good looking kanji are done with the fonts
IPAPMincho.ttf
MotoyaLMaru.ttf
EPSON Gyousho.otf

the offending kanji is in
Moon font.otf

The left part of the bottom line is in 
IPAPMincho.ttf

The ugly right part in 
Praxis LT.otf


Unfortunately, the bad looking fonts are either large or non-free, so i can't really
append one of those.

I'll try it with a few other fonts.

I suspect this to happen when an actual suspended card is displayed somehow, though
I cannot image a case where this might happen. Countidx will then return a negative
value.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1259 First of all, sorry; I know this is related to issue 978, but I wanted to make a new
thread specifically for the card browser on ankidroid2.

I have a deck with ~25,000 cards, and it takes ~10s to open the browser on my galaxy
S2 (a fast phone!). There used to be an option to cache the card browser in memory
but that doesn't seem to work anymore. In comparison Ankidroid 1 used to take around
60s for this particular deck, which is great, but it's still about 10x too slow for
my tastes. 

It was suggested in issue 978 that the loading time  could be significantly reduced
by simply not displaying all of the cards at first. This could be achieved either by
automatically loading cards as they are scrolled into view (as per desktop), or by
paginating the display for decks with large number of cards (I would say &gt; 2000 cards).

Note that searching is MUCH faster than ankidroid1, to the point of not really being
a problem IMO. However, performance could still be significantly increased by providing
an option to turn off auto-search when typing.

Below is a bug report specifically for the cache option not working, but I personally
recommend implementing the above suggestions instead, and simply removing the cache
option which was not very user friendly to begin with.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Turn on the card browser cache feature
2. Browse a deck with a large number of cards
3. Exit the browser
4. Open the browser again for the same deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect the deck to load instantly, or ask if I want to load from memory, as per previous
versions of ankidroid. Instead it just does the same thing as before I checked the
cache option.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Everytime


What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
Beta 8

On what version of Android?
4.0.3

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1261 apkg is the format for Anki 2 import/export.

It can be expected that some people will struggle a bit to convert all of their decks
from 1.x to 2.x at once, so apkg import would be very convenient.

Damien:The mobile clients will be able to download decks via the download link
from within the program. To support this you'll need apkg import
functionality if you don't have it already - which would be good to
have in any case, as it's the only way users can export parts of their
collection.
Kostas: I guess we should start working on this apkg import asap, we can probably take
the import part from the existing module in the python code, right?
Damien: Yeah, it should be sufficient to just port the desktop code.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1265 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card template (mine are for Japanese Kana) using only characters (i.e.
fonts, no images)
2. Change size to whatever you feel like. I've tried up to 200px (I can now study using
the desktop client from the other side of the room)
3. Ankidroid presents the characters of both question and answer in what appears to
be the smallest font size which Android is capable of rendering)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- Character size should scale according to template information?
- Tiny, tiny characters.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every. Single. Time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
v2.0beta9

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.0.3 (ASUS Transformer TF-101)

Please provide any additional information below.
This is a deck which worked as expected on: the web (iphone to be exact, desktop (win
and osx), and Ankidroid - all 1.x. The *converted* deck looks normal on the beta web
and on win and osx clients. I've tried editing the templates as many ways as I can
think of (although admittedly I don't really know that much about how templates work)
and I still get tiny fonts in the Ankidroid client.
Screenshot attached.

When I sync in akidroid 2.0beta9, it downloads all the decks to my phone. And I don't
want them to be all on the phone. Some have a lot of media and takes space on my phone,
and I feel guilty for the extra, useless bandwith taken from the ankiweb servers.


This feature is available on the 1.x series of ankidroid (I think).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1268 Using AnkiDroid v2.0beta9 on Android 2.2

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a deck with some suspended cards. In the summary screen, the due count might
indicate something like &quot;Due today: 10 0 10&quot;.
2. Open the card browser and unsuspend a card, then close the card browser.
3. The line still reads &quot;Due today: 10 0 10&quot;, when &quot;10 0 11&quot; is expected (if the card
wasn't new).

This error follows through into reviewing:
4. Click &quot;Start Reviewing&quot;.
5. The due count is now &quot;10 0 9&quot;, which is neither of the two values from before. The
unsuspended card does actually show up in the reviews, which means the due count can
end up with negative numbers.

Bonus bug:
If you have finished reviewing, and your due count is &quot;0 0 0&quot;, then unsuspending some
cards leaves your due count still as &quot;0 0 0&quot;. This means when you click &quot;Start Reviewing&quot;,
your lesson ends immediately, even though you have some cards waiting to be reviewed
since you just unsuspended them.

The due counts are corrected when you return to the deck picker screen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1270 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review some mature cards
2. Look at the graphs &quot;Review count&quot; and &quot;Review Time&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect that the graphs show the number/the time of mature reviews in dark green.
Instead all reviews are shown as young cards (light green), on both AnkiDroid and Anki
Desktop.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

It happens every time that I review mature cards.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

Please provide any additional information below.
Well, thankfully, this app has a &quot;whiteboard&quot; function which I use to avoid
the crash.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1274 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Select Default deck
2. Click on the &quot;Add card&quot; symbol
3. See that the note type is &quot;Cloze&quot;
4. Go back to the deck browser without creating a new card
5. Click on the &quot;Add card&quot; symbol in the deck browser
6. See that the note type is &quot;Basic&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The default note type of the Default deck should always be the more useful &quot;Basic.&quot;

Doing it the other way around gives the expected result, i.e.
1. Click on the &quot;Add card&quot; symbol in the deck browser
2. See that the note type is &quot;Basic&quot;
3. Go back to the deck browser without creating a new card

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1277 Hi folks,

maybe there is already something that I'm looking for and I'm just blind, but here
is my proposal:
usually, when I learn with AnkiDroid, I don't learn just one deck, I want to learn
all of them. And if you have ten or more decks, it gets a litte bit annoying to switch
to the start-screen and choose a new deck to learn.

So my wish is: Either a button on the start-screen &quot;Learn all decks&quot; that omits the
screen at the end of learning all due cards and switches automatically to the next
deck in turn;
or a button on just that screen (where &quot;Back to decks&quot; and &quot;To learn settings&quot; are
displayed) that enables you to switch directly to the next deck without going to start-screen.

Best regards,
Hans

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1279 Hello,

although I am not necessarily against the Anki 2.0 design and don’t want to write anything
bad before it is actually released, I am a bit confused.

When I enter a new card on Ankidroid, I can select “Note type” and get the type of
other decks. I honestly don’t understand why I would need that. If I have a Japanese
and a French deck, they have absolutely nothing in common, except that I use Ankidroid
for learning them. Why would I select a Japanese note type when adding French vocabulary?
This just bloats the entire list, in my opinion.

Also, if I already opened my Japanese deck, I can select the deck where the card is
to be inserted. But when I already have the Japanese deck open, why would I want to
insert it in the French deck?
This makes sense when I add a card from the deck browser, but not when I already opened
a deck. I think it just confuses.

I don’t know how the others feel, but for me, I liked the classic Anki method a little
bit better. That now only one collection file is created is fine, but I think this
method of shifting cards between different decks does not serve any purpose, if the
decks have no logical connection to each other. So maybe it would be good if at least
the models and the deck choice would not be shown anymore if I already opened a deck.
For adding cards from the deck browser, this is fine, but I honestly don’t see the
point when I’ve already opened one deck. Or maybe a classic mode would be nice (Although
this would again add an item to the option menu, then making the options more confusing
as they already are).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1281 This crash is probably caused, because a font file is corrupt or just not a font file

http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_bug?bug_id=3477052

to check on font selection if it's a real font file is probably too unsecure (as it
may be corrupted later). We could just catch the error and show a toast like &quot;font
xxx is unusable&quot;

Not sure, triage crash:
http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_crash?crash_id=3457119

Apparently it happens in the card browser, when we update a note and some of the cards
of the note are not shown in the card browser list.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1285 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set up a deck that uses some special fonts. See below
2. After starting AnkiDroid, start reviewing
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
All text from the card should appear.
Instead, only parts of the text appears at first.
When the card is redrawn, for example after rotating the tablet, the text missing at
first is finally shown

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I am not quite sure. It may not happen every time, but quite frequently.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Android 4.0.3
AnkiDroid 2.0.beta11


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

I have attached one deck/model/card where i saw this problem.

The first image shows only a German word.
For the second image, i just rotated the tablet by 90⁰. Now there are two lines of
text. The upper line should have been there in the first image, too.

The IPAPMincho font of the first image can be found at http://ossipedia.ipa.go.jp/ipafont/index.html
the font of the German text (Demos LT) is a commercial font that i won't attach.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1288 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. For me, this happens every day.  I review all my cards in the morning (around 9
or 10am) until there are no more reviews.
2. I check again in the evening (I know it happens by 3pm, exact time unknown) and
I see 20 or so more review cards due (my usual daily dose for this deck)
3. If I review all of these and then check the next morning at 9am there are no new
reviews.  Reviews and also the new-cards seem to replenish in the middle of the day
instead of the middle of the night.

I'm wondering if it has to do with some time-zone or UTC issue?  I'm in the Pacific
time-zone on Android 4.0 and my phone clock shows the correct local time.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect that if I review at 6pm the previous day I can see more review cards
by 9am the next day.  And I wouldn't expect to get ~20 new reviews in the middle of
the day.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

All my decks show this every day.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

I was using beta 2.4, but recently upgraded to 2.11.  The problem appears to persist.
 FWIW, one of my decks was originally created on my phone at the previous anki1 release,
and another one was created on my computer and synced through ankiweb to ankidroid.
 Both decks see the issue.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

No crash.  If there is any data (logs etc) I can collect though, let me know.

Please provide any additional information below.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1291 
What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. I made same tests with Anki Desktop (import, delete,…). I finished test with empty
all collection and synchronization.
2. I run AnkiDroid without synchronization and revise.
3. I run AnkiDroid synchronization. This one rewrites AnkiDroid collection with Anki
Desktop collection without any massage. 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I think that AnkiDroid has to warning if it wants to rewrite different collection and
offers possibility to choose what and where I want to synchronize.
I usually use both, Anki and AnkiDroid. If I am not sure about synchronization to web
and I want to keep collection on AnkiDroid for example I usually revise a few words
with AnkiDroid and run synchronization. AnkiDroid display a warning message about different
collections and I have a possibility to select collection for synchronization.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one
time?

Yes, I tried it again with the same result.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1293 First of all, please ignore Issue 1292 as I mistakenly hit the enter button while typing
the summary.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Using both Anki desktop and Ankidroid (synchronized)
2. Creating a subdeck in the desktop client
3. Clicking either the new subdeck's options or parent deck's options

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the normal options window to appear. Instead, I get the following error which
Damien says comes from a mistake in Ankidroid's code ( https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ankisrs-users/DmH-EG_QRxQ/maAGhIZg72sJ

Example template: 'Spanish term for &quot;{{English}}&quot;?'

In the above example, pressing the &quot;Play&quot; button only replays &quot;Spanish term for...&quot;
and then it stops. This seems to only happen if there is preset text in the template.
If the template contains only fields with no other text, I can replay the cards to
my heart's content.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1299 I have a Spanish and Catalán deck, and I've noticed when I try to add, for example the
word &quot;fence&quot; to one, I can't add it to the other because Anki thinks it's a duplicate.
Maybe my understanding of duplicates in Anki is poor, and if so, please correct me
on how to properly do this. But I think it would be able to use the same word in separate
decks. Thanks for all the hard work!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1302 Some people prefer dark tones for aesthetic or energy reasons.

A dark theme would nicely complement the current white theme.

It is too late for 2.0, but it could be in 2.1 or a later version.

I have never touched theming personally, but I think it involves mostly XML files editing
and a bit of Java programming. The best is to check how it was done in AnkiDroid 1.1.x:
https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/Anki-Android/tree/maintenance_1.1
The white theme was really different, so I suggest comparing the blue and black(?)
themes that existed at the time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1314 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Creation of my own deck in Anki on Windows (in Simplified Chinese)
2. Syncing on Ankidroid and seeing the deck
3. Adding new cards to Anki on Windows but not being able to see them on Ankidroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would like to see the new cards I made on Windows show up on Ankidroid. They are
not displaying however.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes every time.

1. Launch ankidroid from being completely stopped
2. Observe undo is disabled on first card viewed
3. Review card and the undo button stays disabled

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
* The undo button should become enabled after a card is reviewed
* Hitting the back button and then start reviewing again enables the undo button

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1316 Is is possible to preload the audio files for the next card into RAM?

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Change ankidroid folder to external SD card
2. Review deck with audio in both question and answer


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect to hear normal audio output on both sides of the card, but the audio for the
question glitches (stops and starts again a few 100ms later) in the middle of the file
(as if it runs out of buffer). The answer plays perfectly fine.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It happens for more than 50% of the cards in my collection. I have a reputable Class
10, 16GB Toshiba microSD card. It is formatted as NTFS as a workaround for issue 1158,
though I don't think that's related to the glitchy audio. I never saw this problem
when my ankidroid folder was on internal SD.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
2 beta 13

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1317 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set up a synced deck on Windows and Android
2. Change a card in AnkiDroid
3. Sync
4. In Desktop Anki's Card Browser, search for the card by name

What is the expected output?
The card should be found.

What do you see instead?
The card isn't found (but it still exists and can be found browsing manually through
the list).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happenend several times for me and I'm quite sure it's repeatable with above steps.
Maybe it also occurs under broader conditions.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
1.1.3

On what version of Android?
4.1.1 on European Nexus S

Version of Desktop Anki?
Windows 1.28

Additional information:

1. My guess is that AnkiDroid somehow stores the card data in a slightly different
way so that Desktop Anki has problems searching through the fields.
2. A workaround that works for me: In Desktop Anki do Tools -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Check Database...
Although it always states &quot;no problems were found&quot;, it consistently fixes the issue.
The drawback is, it forces a full sync with the server which causes unneccessary traffic.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1318 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use font scaling of 150%
2. Use CSS and templates as in the attached deck

The text should be scaled up by 150%. It is not.

Android: 4.0.3
Ankidroid:
It worked all right with AnkiDroid 13, up to commit d9cec83cff2a2ddeaa92b4b823e47b5b3239fbd5
The commit 525f6238a80b7c78488f9d77173fa7f28a163f2e broke it.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

The three images are:

 * The setting, with the font scaling set to 150%
 * The one card with the font at 150 %, using beta 13
 * The same card, with nothing changed but using the &quot;Improved relative font scaling&quot;
commit for Anki 14. The font is smaller.

The deck should contain the card shown.

The card does not use relative font sizes, even less nested relative font sizes. (Those
were mentioned in the comment which called the code &quot;not bullet proof&quot;.) The size is
set only once, in the .card{} bit.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1321 Please explain your idea here.

On some cards I find the whiteboard to be in the way: E.g. if I want to replay the
audio on a card. I have to turn off the wb, press the play button, turn on the wb on
the next card I need it on. It's not _work_, but it's a hassle that takes the mind
off the task of remembering.

It would be much easier if I could insert a code in the card template that temporarily
disables the whiteboard, e.g. {{whiteboardOff}} or {{#Whiteboard}} and {{/Whiteboard}}.
If no tag is on the card, the default is used.

This would also be an aid in using the suggestion in issue
http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=1319

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

I don't think so, but adding codes like these would probably have to be discussed with
anki desktop, unless it could be specified in the card for one platform only(?) (Anki
apparently supports platform specific CSS for .linux, .mobile (iPhone only?), .mac
and .win (I don't see android on that list), though I don't know if that is relevant
here.)

2 is looking really good btw. :-)

doesn't appear. The same is valid about Undo button.
3. They can be got to redraw by pressing the Menu button (the most right button with
tree dots).

Tickmark should appear at once when I press the button. Undo should become active when
there is something which may be undone (not only after I press Menu button).

It happens always.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1324 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Get more than 1000 reviews in any deck.
2. Set the limit of reviews in that deck to 9999.
3. When the deck is selected, the counts above the graph display the right figures.
But the number in the deck list is 1000. Anki Desctop displays 1000+ in this case,
not 1000 exactly.
4. The figure in the AnkiDroid window title is the sum of cards to be learned and 1000,
which has nothing to do with actual counts and might be mesleading.
5. This number is propagated to the widget on the desktop.

I would like to see these figures not limited by 1000. I really often have a backlog
of a few thousands, so I need to know the right figures.

If the figures have to be limited, they shouldn't be displayed in the program title
and in the widget as they are misleading.


Happens everytime.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1325 I did install Anki 2.0 beta 18 on my Samsung Galaxy SII and did a backup of the database
before. Then I followed the instructions for conversion (let AnkiDroid upload the decks
to the web, convert them, download). Download produced an error and instructions followed
that I should try to repair my database with the desktop version. 

Unfortunately the desktop version also only shows two of my previously existing decks.
Then I logged in to Anki web and there I could find all five decks, though not the
most actual version (which is not so problematic).

Logging in to new Anki web I do see the same two decks that I see now in my desktop
version, but not more.

So my question is: How can I restore the backup on my Android device and synch ALL
decks to AnkiWeb and Anki Desktop (Win 7, Home Prof, 32 bit)

Kind regards and thank you very much in advance for helping me!

If this post is obsolete or in the wrong place please just let me know where to post
to get help and delete this post. Thank you very much!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1326 I would like to ask that you 

1) enable mobile device camera for direct attachments to a card. There is so much information
every day one needs to learn that could be easily captured by using the camera of the
mobile device.

2) Same for audio: I am urgently waiting that a simple recording can be attached to
a card directly from the mobile device.

If this is already possible, please let me know how to accomplish this. If this is
scheduled for development I would be more than happy!

Thank you very much for your help!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1327 I'm not completely sure whether to report this as a bug or an enhancement, but since
syncing works, I choose the latter. Please change if wrong.

Ankidroid v2.0beta13
Android 4.04
Phone: Sony Xperia S (LT26i)

Please explain your idea here.

As syncing progresses, several messages are displayed in the log, but only one at a
time. Lastly there is a message about media, but I never get to read it; partly because
the final status replaces it, and partly because for some reason the dialog shakes.
(The same kind of shake as the login dialog in Gnome on Linux makes when the password
is wrong.)

To me that shake signals a failure of some kind. 

The feeling I get when syncing is that something was wrong with the media, but then
the final report says &quot;Collection successfully synchronized&quot;. I think this should be
addressed, but it's a small thing in the beta race.

Anyways, three ways to fix this:

- Make the dialog stop shaking. Then I might get a glimpse of the whole text.

- Alter the dialog to add the new messages at the bottom instead of replacing the old
with the new. (Scrollable?)

- Final report includes some indication of the success or failure in different parts
of the syncing process

Using it with AnkiDroid it doesn't work. There at AnkiDroid I set up &quot;visibility of
the question&quot; to &quot;like definied in the card model&quot;. But the card model is ignored.

Of course If I set it up to &quot;hide question&quot; it work for all cards. But I only want
it to work for one model. The other models should show there questions.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1329 Currently you see three digits for each deck in the decks overview. I would like to
propose that for motivation reasons you also display the total number of cards of a
deck in the decks overview, just like in the decks view itself.

For better separation it could make sense to place that number LEFT of the deck's name.
That should not be difficult to code.

Thank you very much and keep up the good work.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1336 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start reviewing with whiteboard and the tablet in portrait orientation. (Almost
wlog, see below.)
2. Rotate so it is landscape orientation
3. Draw in the extreme right of the screen

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
What you draw should stay visible.
Instead it is clipped when you lift the finger


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens all the time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

Android 4.0.3
AnkiDroid 2.0.beta16


(...)


Please provide any additional information below.

Screen size is 1024x768. The tablet is a cheap generic one. The actual type name is
TAB-PROTAB2-IPS9.

This appears quite similar, but not identical to issue #72.

I get similar problems when i start in horizontal or in vertical mode. But there seems
to be a small difference:
When i start in portrait and rotate to landscape, the clipping edge seems to be quite
close to what was the old right edge.
When i start in landscape and rotate to portrait, there is still clipping but the clipping
edge is a bit away from the old bottom edge.

The image names should explain what happens in each one.

P.S. There is a 「聞いて。」 missing in image 5. That is issue #1285.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1338 On Anki 2.0-beta18 on Windows, I renamed the default deck to &quot;US Presidents&quot; and moved
my US Presidents cards to the renamed default deck.

On AnkiDroid 2.0beta16, I tried to review that deck early, which is supposed to create
a temporary filtered deck, I think? But no additional deck was created, as far as I
can tell. However, the 16 cards it added to the review queue did appear with a due
date of (filtered) in the desktop card browser, even though they're still in the US
Presidents deck.

When I tap &quot;show answer&quot; on the first of these filtered cards in AnkiDroid, I get a
database error (&quot;An error occurred while writing to the collection...).

When I click &quot;show answer&quot; on the same card on the desktop, I get the following error
data:

No option in Preferences&gt;Reviewing or Deck/Reviews

Every time

Android JB 4.1.1 for Google Nexus S

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1340 Hello

Sometimes I need to change more than one option in the settings.

For example, I have a pack of audio and a deck with an image. I usually work with audio
pack (swype is enabled). If I need to zoom in on the table with the image I hit at
least 6 times in order to enable this.

It would be nice if the presets were dependent on the current deck. (I mean, the automatic
change of settings by changing the deck)


Thank you for ankidroid!

When the reviewer loses focus and is then re-focused, the timer that appears in the
top-right doesn't resume.

Two common scenarios that reproduce this while reviewing a card:
1 - Push power button to turn off screen
2 - Push power button to turn on screen
3 - Unlock screen
4 - Back in AnkiDroid reviewer, timer is still paused.

or

1 - Bring up the recent apps list
2 - Select an app to open
3 - Close the app (either back button or app's own exit button)
4 - Back in AnkiDroid reviewer, timer is still paused.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1344 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Finish reviewing of one deck
2.Return to study screen
3.The statistic information for this deck is not refreshed. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It should be refreshed after review. For example, before review, the due number is
20, after I finish all cards, it should be 0. This information only refreshes after
I go back to decks screen and enter the same deck again.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens everytime.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Ankidroid V2.0beta16 on Android 4.0.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
It's not a crash

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1345 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Not sure, happens during media syncing.

It means that after media syncing we have the wrong number of media files between ankiweb
and AnkiDroid

Which means that at least one of the following cases is not handled properly by Ankidroid
when media syncing:
- Add a media file in anki, means that while syncing AnkiDroid didn't manage to create
the file locally.
- Delete a media file in anki, means that while syncing AnkiDroid didn't manage to
delete the file locally.
- Add a media file in AnkiDroid, means that after syncing the server the server didn't
create the new file correctly.
- Delete a media file from AnkiDroid, means that after syncing the server hasn't deleted
the file.

The problem could be due to local FS issues not handled properly, or not sending the
right instructions to ankiweb when syncing (eg asking to delete wrong filenames that
don't exist).

Or due to hidden files in media folder not being picked up during syncing, but still
counted in the sanity check.

In other words this needs lots of investigation.

It's currently the most frequent problem in beta16 and although it doesn't cause crashes,
it triggers full media syncs which can consume a lot of bandwith both for the users
and ankiweb.

So it needs resolving.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1346 Some people use email (or email drafts?) as an alternative to USB or ankiweb.

Apparently some versions of the GMail app prevent users from downloading files with
extensions that are not &quot;registered&quot; or something.
There is even an app whose purpose is to manually register extensions.
Details here: http://android.stackexchange.com/a/13647/501

AnkiDroid could &quot;register&quot; the &quot;.anki&quot;, &quot;.anki2&quot; file extensions (and maybe others?
every Anki-related file one could send by email)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1348 Using AnkiDroid 2.0beta16 on Archos 28 4GB, firmware 2.4.83, Android 2.2.1.

Steps:

1. While reviewing, tap the Home button to go to the Android home screen.

2. On the Android home screen, tap the AnkiDroid icon to return to AnkiDroid.

Observed behavior: Sometimes, when returning to AnkiDroid, I am returned to the same
card I was reviewing when I tapped the Home button. But at other times, the &quot;Opening
collection, please wait&quot; screen is briefly shown, and then there is a force close.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1350 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Learn with AnkiDroid on a tablet until you are done with a subdeck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The due count for that deck should read 0 0 0
Instead, it shows the count from before you started reviewing.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens every time.

This may be related to issue #1235. At least it is a similar effect. My guess is that

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1354 AnkiDroid v2.0beta16 on Android 2.2

From this forum thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/anki-android/r0PeLQ1JZQ0

Setting this options:
Wrench --&gt; New Cards --&gt; Order --&gt; &quot;New cards in random order&quot;

...has no effect on the order of new cards. After setting this option and syncing with
Anki Desktop, the option remains ticked over there but the order is still not randomized
even in Anki Desktop. (So it seems the order is supposed to be set once the option
is ticked, not when reviewing starts.)

Going the other way around does work as you'd expect, however. That is, on Anki Desktop,
selecting &quot;New cards in random order&quot; then syncing to AnkiDroid results in new cards
appearing in random order on AnkiDroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1355 AnkiDroid v2.0beta16 on Android 2.2

(This behaviour was present in beta15, so it wasn't broken by this change http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=1343)


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set a timebox interval of 1 minute.
2. Review for several few minutes
3. Observe only the first notification


The desktop client continues to show timebox notifications even after the first period
has elapsed.


Please provide any additional information below.
Apart from the notification itself, the desktop client also informs you how many cards
you answered during the time period, whereas AnkiDroid does not.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1356 I have started using the sub-deck feature of anki 2.0. However my decks are quickly
growing into a pretty long list which I have to scroll in order to find a specific
deck. It would be nice if anki and ankidroid had a expand and collapse deck feature
in the Decks display screen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1357 I file this request here, since this is from a ankidroid user's perspective.

Please explain your idea here.

After sending a crash report, the user's comment is nowhere to be found. It isn't included
in the triage report. This makes it impossible to add info that is only available after
restarting ankidroid. Case in hand: I entered a description of what I did as ankidroid
crashed, but I didn't know if the operation succeeded before the crash. It did, so
I wanted to add the fact to my earlier comment, but could not.

What I now can do, is to add a bug referring to the triage crash report, but without
access to the original text.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1359 Hi,
I've only got one very simple question. I created several collections of cards on Anki
Windows. These cards contain pictures or soundfiles and they use special fonts. I thought
I could import all that on my Android pad in order to sometimes learn a bit on it and
then later copy back the Anki file to this main computer. But it seems that Ankidroid
is a completely different program : it doesn't recognize anki files and I can see no
way to convert easily one into the other. Even worse : Ankidroid doesn't take pictures
and sounds. Is it right to think that it's hopeless?
Thank your for your answer.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1361 Right now JavaScript resizes big images so that they fit on the screen, with the size
given by this piece of Java:

mCardTemplate = mCardTemplate.replaceFirst(&quot;var availableWidth = \\d*;&quot;, 
String.format(Locale.US, &quot;var availableWidth = %d;&quot;, getAvailableWidthInCard()));

Apparently this can be done in a much easier way, with no JavaScript:

webview.getSettings().setLayoutAlgorithm(LayoutAlgorithm.SINGLE_COLUMN);

See http://stackoverflow.com/a/12327010/226958

Having no JavaScript might also make card loading a bit faster.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1364 After switching the Layout to &quot;Android dark&quot; the start window button-layout is changed
to white text on black background but texts on the cards stay black on white background
and the rating buttons remain colored texts on white ground. White backgrounds cost
a lot of battery-energy and the bright background blinds and hurts my eyes. And the
texts on the rating buttons are difficult to read.

Please make the Cards and the rating buttons of the &quot;Android dark&quot; layout with white
text on black background. Only then the &quot;Android dark&quot; layout is in accordance with
the well chosen standard Android layout with white texts on black background for best
ergonomics and energy saving on mobile phones.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1365 Hey guys,

at first: thanks for that gread app! If I could help you let me know!
I am studying for my law exames and have to know some definitions of legal terms. 

I would like to have the possibilty to play a whole deck or for e.g. 20 cards in full
TTS mode. Like I am jogging and anki just reading my cards and I listen to front and
back. After that Anki should jump to the next card.

Is that possible? :) 

I didn't see a flashcard app available doing it, so I can't add some screenshots.

Best regards!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1369 I've submitted this issue before (1293), but although Norbert updated the status there
to FixedInDev, I'm still having the problem.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Using both Anki desktop and AnkiDroid (synced)
2. Creating a subdeck in the desktop client
3. Syncing with AnkiDroid
4. Clicking either the new subdeck's options or parent deck's options in the desktop
client

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the normal options window to appear. Instead, if I choose &quot;Options&quot; under
the gear menu in the Decks screen, I get the following error:

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one
time?
Every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)
V 2.0 Beta 16

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android version) 4.1.1
(tablet), 2.3.3 CM (phone)


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

Note: I have attached two screen clippings. Please refer to them to understand the
explanation below.

First of all, please note that this error doesn't occur in AnkiDroid. I'm able to access
the options in all the decks and subdecks without a problem in AnkiDroid. Instead,
it occurs in the desktop client, although apparently AnkiDroid is responsible for causing
it.

Second of all, the problem started when I created a new deck called &quot;textmem&quot; and moved
382 cards to it from &quot;Default&quot;. I then made &quot;textmem&quot; a subdeck of &quot;Default&quot;. The problem
probably started after I synced with AnkiWeb a few times from both Anki and AnkiDroid.
When I filed issue 1293 and Norbert was looking into it, I remember that if I made
&quot;textmem&quot; an independent deck, I could access the options in &quot;Default&quot; just fine. If
I then moved &quot;textmem&quot; under &quot;Default&quot; as a subdeck again, the problem returned. I
verified this a few times. Norbert then had me send him my deck. He said that he found
the problem and fixed it. He then gave me steps to resolve the issue. It didn't work.
After a few weeks, for some reason, I had to format all my electronics - my laptop,
tablet, and phone. So, I reinstalled Anki and AD and downloaded the content from AnkiWeb
again. Since then, the problem doesn't go away, regardless of whether I make &quot;textmem&quot;
an independent deck or subdeck of &quot;Default&quot;. In fact, it got worse. I recently added
a bunch of subdecks to &quot;Default&quot; to organize the introduction of new material. Now,
trying to access the options in either the parent or any subdeck (all 12 of them) results
in the two errors listed above. Please refer to the screen clippings to understand.

Thank you for your help.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1372 I'm sorry, but I can't reproduce this issue. It happens sporadically to me (seems to
be at least a few times a week), but I haven't been able to pinpoint the conditions
to reproduce the problem. I get a &quot;known issue&quot; response when I send my error logs
so maybe you already know about it.

It seems likely that the database is not actually corrupted because if I choose &quot;clear
all errors&quot; and then force close the app using task manager, then upon restarting the
app I no longer get the corrupted database error and continue reviewing as if it never
happened.

I think this is a really serious problem, please let me know if there is anything I
can do to help with debugging.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1373 I am attempting to restore a lost deck using Anki 2 beta desktop on mac.  I import the
backup.anki2 file in the backups folder and get an &quot;Unknown file format&quot; error... 
Has anyone dealt with this in Anki 2 before?  Really hoping I didn't lose the entire
deck without a way to restore :\

Thanks,

p.s. I've attached the backup file below (backup-10.anki2)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1374 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Press sync button. 
2. Try to login or create a new account.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Synchronize with beta ankiweb. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time. I have tried multiple different email addresses and have triple checked
all posts.  It won't even let me register a new account.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1377 I used to long click on the card -&gt; card details and I could change the deck from there.
This is no longer possible as it only shows the question and answer now.

Could you add a &quot;Change Deck&quot;/&quot;Move Card&quot; option or something to change the deck directly
from the right click menu? This is the most intuitive way for me.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1380 in AnkiDroid 1.x we used to have an option for switching question and answer. Though
it is not recommended and actually thwarts the srs, it was a quite requested feature.
We gave a hint about the disadvantages and let people decide.

It seems as if people miss this feature in the upcoming AnkiDroid 2.0. Therefore, it
might be useful to give some information about the concept, the possibilities how to
add new cards and maybe even an simple automatic function to add reversed cards.

This could be done in the wiki or in ankidroid itself. What do you think?

Anki Desktop has the same problem: Can you please leave the position and size of buttons
(1min, 10min, 1day, 4 days) over different flashcards on the same position? I know
it is a bit tricky cause there are different options available according the state
of the card. But at least there should be always the same grouping (4 buttons), and
the 4 days should always be at the right position, and the default option should always
be at the same position (second place maybe). It's okay not to fill the whole space.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1393 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Set new card steps to &quot;1 10 100 1400&quot;, and set graduate interval to 2 days.
2.After learning for 1 day, and open the application on 2nd day
3.In deck summary, the due count is&quot;20 6 50&quot;, however, in all decks list, the due count
of this deck is&quot;20 0 50&quot;, the 2nd number is always 0.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The 2nd number should be also 6 which is identical to real situation. But in my configuration,
it's always 0. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes, every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
Ankidroid 2.0 beta 17
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
android 4.0.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
Not crash.

Please provide any additional information below.
I set the graduate interval to 2 days, because the words are a little difficult to
remember and need more time to learn.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1395 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. share any one-field data with anki and press later
2. go to saved data
3. choose the data you just added

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect Anki to place one-field data in the first field. Instead, it places it in
the second field. I have to press Swap twice (potentially more based on the note) on
each new card before adding it, wiping out benefits expected from using saved data.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
every time

Please provide any additional information below.
In the default &quot;Basic&quot; note, the one-field text is sent to &quot;Back&quot; instead of &quot;Front&quot;.
By one-field, I mean a one-line or one-paragraph text that Anki cannot divide into
two fields.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1397 What steps will reproduce the problem?
These are the steps I took, I don't know if they can be reproduced with any deck.
1. I had a deck of 400 cards that I was reviewing daily.
2. In preparation for a test, I chose &quot;Review Early,&quot; chose 2 days, and created the
filtered deck. I then opened the deck and chose &quot;Start Reviewing&quot; and the app crashed
(I submitted a bug report).
3. I then tried again, crashed again, and submitted another stacktrace.
4. I then tried 1 day instead of 2, but it crashed again.
5. Finally I tried to create a Cram deck manually, but trying to review it also crashed.
6. Each time I tried something new, I deleted the old review/cram deck and started
again.
7. At the end of the process I noticed my Default deck (which I've never used) had
30 cards in it. I opened it up and saw they were some cards from my original deck of
400. I then opened my original deck and saw it only contained 303 cards. I immediately
did a full sync from my desktop and downloaded that sync to my Android to revert the
damage, but something went seriously wrong here...

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Working filtered/cram/review early decks. Instead got a serious of crashes and data
corruption.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happened consistently each time I tried.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
v2.0beta17 on 2.3.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
You should have received 4-5 stacktrace reports from me in a row, about 15 minutes
ago.

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1409 When gestures are enabled and we associate &quot;Answer button 1&quot; to some gesture then in
learning mode (where there are 3 answer buttons displayed), the second answer button
is selected. Now, it is quite troublesome because it brings inconsistency into the
learning process. It might be avoided by introducing &quot;Answer Failed&quot; action. In that
case whether there are 3 or 4 buttons, fail means fail.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1419 Issue 778 and issue 1415 are related.

AnkiDroid currently seems to have its own feature for adding custom fonts, but that
feature doesn't seem to work when the font is explicitly set for a current field already,
and it relies on the filename for the font name instead of using the native font name.

Unlike Anki 1, Anki 2 documents a way to add fonts to the media folder. Not only will
this also set the fonts up properly for the desktop, but it will ensure the fonts are
included as part of a normal sync and means that no further setup is required on the
mobile clients or web client. More info:

http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#installingfonts

Two questions:

- does this work on AD already? If the html base tag has been set to the media folder,
the AD webviews should be able to pick up the font automatically
- is there any point to having the separate fonts folder on AnkiDroid now that such
a feature exists? It seems silly to have to configure it more than once.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1422 I was always iffy about this app.  
By suggesting users switch to a beta with as much instability as this one is a sure
way to lose users. 
Do some proper work to get it running on all platforms before you start changing the
library format and soliciting android users to switch over.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1429 I'm trying to add support for creating flash cards in AnkiDroid from my dictionary app.
It works fine with 2.0 but with 1.1.3 (but the current version in Google Play) it just
crashes.

It is crashing with a null pointer in line 595 of CardEditor.java, which is this bit
of code:

    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        MenuItem item;
        Resources res = getResources();
&gt;&gt;HERE&gt;&gt;    Lookup.initialize(this, mDeck.getDeckPath());

I guess mDeck is null. It looks like it's trying to launch a dialog to allow the user
to select the deck but this line is trying to use the deck before it has been selected.

The same crash is replicatable with the Indiclash sample code here:
https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/Indiclash

As a side note, it looks like the name of the intent has changed from     org.openintents.indiclash.CREATE_FLASHCARD
to org.openintents.action.CREATE_FLASHCARD in 2.0. I think I'm going to make my app
just try both strings. Is there a good reason to change the name? Isn't that just going
to break any existing apps that are already using the old string?

It's not clear from the description on openintents which string is the canonical one.

Synchronisation should occur. First I am notified that sanity check failed, try full
synch. Full synch does not work also. I can read &quot;Ваша база данных повреждена. Пожалуйста

again. See 2131165912 about database restoration).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Repeats all the time with my current database.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.0beta19
On what version of Android? 4.0.4


Please provide any additional information below.
Also strange bug with time appeared about 2 weeks ago. It shows the time remaining
and time spent to repetions with coefficient approx. -1000, i.e. -10000 minutes instead
of 10 minutes.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1434 Please explain your idea here.
I upgraded to version 2.0 mainly because I thought that with the parent deck I could
review all my decks together, but I recently noticed that it review all the cards in
one deck then it change to the next deck and shows every card in these deck and so
on, one of my biggest problems reviewing in Anki 1.1 was that I already knew what card
would appear in each deck. Is it possible to create an option that reviews all decks
together, mixing all the cards contained in a parent deck?

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.
I looked the user manual form Anki desktop, but didn't find anything like that.

I created a filtered deck on Android (beta 19)

Synced with my desktop (2.0.0)

On my desktop, I clicked on deck options for the new, filtered deck and got the following
response:

===========

An error occurred. It may have been caused by a harmless bug,
 or your deck may have a problem.
 To confirm it's not a problem with your deck, please run Tools &gt; Maintenance &gt; Check
Database.
 If that doesn't fix the problem, please copy the following
 into a bug report:
 Traceback (most recent call last):

=========

I ran Tools &gt; Maintenance &gt; Check Database and it didn't help.

This was originally posted on the desktop bug list as No. 130, but closed and I was
told to repost on Ankidroid bug list.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1440 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Do *not* set the (text) color in the CSS, use whit as background
2. Review in night mode

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The text color should be changed from black to white, as the background color is changed
from white to black.
Instead you get a useless black-on-black card.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

It is not.

There is, of course, the reasonable workaround of setting the text color.

Here is some documentation about how to implement it correctly:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1443 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I created a filtered deck on the AnkiDroid client. Reviewing the deck worked fine.

2. I synched and tried to review the same deck on the windows 2.0.0 client. When I
clicked on &quot;show answer&quot;, the answer card displayed, but then I got errors. I reported
the error to the windows client, but they felt that AnkiDroid wrote some bad data that
they could not read. See https://anki.lighthouseapp.com/projects/100923/tickets/158-typeerror-unsupported-operand-types-for-int-and-unicode
for details of the error and the developer's reply.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Multiple times.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1446 I've created a couple of cloze deletion cards for learning longer passages of text where
two fields are used. Both fields include the same text. In the first field there are
several clozes, to learn the text part by part. In the second field the whole portion
of the text that I'm trying to memorize is put in a cloze. I'm usually learning those
cards by suspending the last cloze (which includes the whole text) until I've learned
the single portions and after some time unsuspending it again.

This works quite well in the desktop version of Anki2, but on the current beta version
of Ankidroid those cards always show the content of both fields, one with the cloze
working properly, the other showing the whole text (nothing blanked out), so I always
see the answer, which is rather counter-productive.

I'm using the following syntax on those cloze deletion cards:

{{#Field1}}{{cloze:Field1}}{{/Field1}}
{{#Field2}}{{cloze:Field2}}{{/Field2}}

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1451 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck where the front side has a photo that wouldn't normally fit on the
phone screen in portrait orientation (I believe I've been using ones that are approx.
640x440px).
2. If starting to review in portrait orientation, everything works as expected. The
image is sized to fit, and if you rotate the screen to landscape orientation, the image
is resized to fit the new screen.
3. However, if you start the review with the phone already in landscape orientation,
the photo isn't sized appropriately (you have to scroll down some to view the entire
photo). It gets even worse when you then switch to portrait orientation (you have to
scroll left/right and up/down to see the whole photo).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Resizing photos should be consistent regardless of the orientation when entering review
mode. It seems like the photo should always be sized to fit the screen (or if not,
at least be consistent in all cases).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It is consistent every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1452 In the list of changes in desktop Anki 2 (http://ankisrs.net/docs/changes.html), it
says:

&quot;Filtered decks also replace the old &quot;review early&quot; button. They offer two advantages:
you can now choose how many days to look ahead, and you can close Anki and resume reviewing
early where you left off, instead of starting with the same cards again like in Anki
1.2.&quot;

The latest AnkiDroid beta (19) still has a &quot;Review Early&quot; button. For consistency between
the two, I'd think &quot;Review Early&quot; should be removed from AnkiDroid and replaced with
filtered deck functionality as well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1453 I just upgraded to the new version 2.0:

PC version: All decks are available and also working with media files

Onn the new web interface I see all decks but I dont see any media files (it says &quot;0.00
MB media&quot;).

All media files on the PC are &quot;next the deck&quot;. 

How can I set Anki PC to upload also the media files?

Many thanks

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1454 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Attempt to sync on versions higher than (not including) v17

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect it to sync successfully, instead, it often ahngs at 0 on both down and
up. Sometimes it goes a little higher, sometimes a LOT higher, but it always seems
to eentually stall before the sync is completed.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Almost every time. Out of my dozens of attempts, syncing only succeeded once.

Syncing never completes, and I am unable to use the application without forcing a close,
which then seems to corrupt something, forcing me to uninstall and reinstall to even
launch the application again. I also have to delete the AnkiDroid folder most time
(though not always!).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1457 I think it would be nice to make it so that the user can make what buttons they want
to cause what options they want.

For example, I find it is annoying having to take my finger from the stick to the D
button, to display an answer. Surely it is much more ergonomic to make it so the user
does not have to take their finger off the stick for each and every answer...
What I recommend is to at least swap the A and D buttons, the A button is much easier
to press, and with less effort. Pressing A at the moment plays audio. Not every deck
has audio, but every deck has an answer, I don't see why playing the audio should 'benefit'
from the larger, more accessible, better (in my opinion) button.

Combined with this, once the answer is displayed, having the A button trigger the recommended
answer would be fantastic. Just like pressing space in desktop anki. The recommended
answer exists in the code, I have made use of it personally in the beta 19 source.

Basically I think it would be good to swap button A and D in the reviewer, and to also
let button A trigger the recommended answer. (Just how space acts in anki desktop,
displaying the answer AND answering with the recommended choice)
That, or, allowing us to edit the configuration of each zeemote button for ourselves,
which would be much more work, which I don't think is as important.

Thank you very much :)

The other way around it works. When there are two files and the second one is missing,
the first one is played.

I have made a short deck with two &quot;[sound:NN]&quot;s on each card and only one file in the
package to demonstrate. Two cards, one with the extant file first and one with the
file second.
(It is hard to tell if one of the file that are not in the collection is played or
not ;) .)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1462 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Download &quot;Spanish 400&quot; deck with pictures.
2. Review a few cards.
3. Delete deck.
4. Try to sync.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The sync tries apparently to upload all the media in the deleted deck back to the server.
After a lengthy upload, an error message is shown. The sync itself seems to work, but
the large (repeating) upload is quite annoying.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Always. Can't get rid of the feature, even by doing a full download from the server.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
v2.0beta19

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

1. Preferences &gt; Reviewing &gt; Card Display &gt; activate &quot;Review in Fullscreen&quot;
2. Open Deck and Review

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Should be in Fullscreen, only reviewing. It still shows Android Top Bar and blue Anki

1. Register at Anki Web
2. Download the deck from anki web to Android Tablet
3. Try to synchronize

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect, that the deck is synchronized and everything works fine. Instead I always
get the message, that &quot;the number of media files an the tablet does not equal the number
of the media files on the server. With the next synchronization this problem will be
solved.&quot; But it does not work a single time.

Everytime

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1465 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. In Anki 2.0 on the desktop replace the LaTeX rendering backend DVIPNG with one that
produces SVGs. Or use ImageMagick to convert a PNG in your media folder to SVG and
delete the PNG.
2. Sync the desktop media and then sync AnkiDroid.
3. AnkiDroid won't load a LaTeX card that is SVG, but it will load a regular card that
has an SVG file, and it will load a card with a LaTeX generated PNG. The Anki desktop
client will load all 3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
 AnkiDroid should load all the same media as the desktop client, even if that includes
LaTeX cards with SVGs.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?


What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
AnkiDroid 2.0-beta20

On what version of Android?
Galaxy Nexus Stock 4.1.2

Here's the SVG generation script, tex2png, that can either be added to $PATH or have
latex.py point to directly:
#! /bin/bash

pdflatex ./tmp.tex
pdfcrop ./tmp.pdf
pdf2svg ./tmp-crop.pdf ./tmp.svg
rm ./tmp.{tex,pdf,log,aux,dvi} ./tmp-crop.pdf

You also have to change some lines in /usr/share/anki/libanki/anki/latex.py:
latexDviPngCmd = [&quot;tex2png&quot;]

    svg = namedtmp(&quot;tmp.svg&quot;)

        if call(latexDviPngCmd,

        shutil.copyfile(svg, os.path.join(mdir, fname))

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1468 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review cards.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Fast loading of new cards and audio output expected as in 1.1.3. Instead it is much
slower than anki 1.1.3 when loading cards and aufio for review. I switched back to
1.1.3 cause it works lightning fast. Tried the different options for fastening anki
2.0, but not much difference.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens always. With different decks.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 
2.0 beta 20
On what version of Android?
Huawei Y200 Android 2.3.6    The device is quite slow, but Anki 1.1.3 works lightning
fast.


Please provide any additional information below.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1470 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Load my attached deck and open &quot;Swedish Aladdin&quot;
2. Proceed to new cards
3. Either answer card or bury card
4. The cards will not be in a random order, regardless of settings.

What is the expected output? Cards which have review order set to &quot;Random&quot; should be
random.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? It did not use to happen,
it only suddenly started to happen. Now, as far as I can tell, it happens almost 100%
of the time. There are rare occasions where re-importing the deck will fix the issue.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.0 v18

On what version of Android? 2.3.5


Please provide any additional information below.

If indexing can cause issues (see below), it would be nice to know when a deck does
not have an index, and then be given the option to regenerate one.


Note from Damien:

Damien Elmes November 6th, 2012 @ 11:45 PM

I've had a look into it. This is happening because the collection is
missing an index, which is causing the cards to appear in creation
order instead of honoring the due column. Please report this issue on
the AD issue tracker.

It has happened several times in the past unexpectedly. Now, as I was filing this issue,
I tried to reproduce it on two separate cards, but couldn't. In both cases, the card
displayed correctly with updates.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1477 Please explain your idea here.

The idea is to add an indicator on cards whilst reviewing which will inform the user
if the card is marked and possibly what tags the card has (this last one is just something
to consider).

The reason this should be implemented is simple; by not doing this, there is 0 point
to even having &quot;mark card&quot; available as a gesture since in most cases on a large deck,
it is difficult to remember what cards have been marked, and you thus have to refer
to the menu to check, removing any ease of use benefits there might've been.

In an ideal world, we'd all instantly do something with our marked cards on the desktop
version of anki right after marking them, but this isn't the case. I don't think I
need to go into detail on what the actual indicator should be; it could be a little
pink square at the top for all I care, so long as it's visible.

Thanks for your time and providing us this great tool.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1482 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Download Core2k6k Japanese Vocabulary Optimized
2. Download and use audio only
3. Use a card setup similar to my pictures below.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected outcome is furigana working for all fields. Instead, it only works for 1 field.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)
2.19 

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
2.3.4

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1483 Please explain your idea here.
Using gestures with the white board is problematic for obvious reasons. My solution
is to scrap the idea of gestures entirely and instead add a hotbar which you can bind
whatever functions you wish to (mark card, suspend, etc). Picture related.

In this way, minimal screen space will be taken up while still maintaining the ease
of access that gestures provided. You've also removed the conflict between gestures
and the whiteboard feature because there is now a clear indicator on the screen of
where it is safe to draw/write.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a page explaining
the feature.
No.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1486 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. For every card, when transitioning from a Question to an Answer, a small spinner
in the top right corner is always shown, just for a few moments, even when there is
no time delay or anything.

It just gets annoying with no real purpose.

Anki latest beta (b20).

It would be much better to not show the spinner if there is not delay. Otherwise, it
switches user's attention from the learning cards and thinking about studying to watching
this spinner in every card.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1487 Sibling Spacing does not seem to be obeyed in Anki Droid (beta 20).

I have the settings for AD and the desktop (Anki 2.0.3) set the same, i.e. minimum
sibling range 5 days, space siblings by up to 50% (whatever that means). And “try not
to show new cards next to each other” is checked.   

Nevertheless, siblings continue to arise very close together (i.e., same day/study
session).

Other questions or advice, please? Thank you.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1489 On AnkiDroid 2 beta 20. Nexus 10 with Android 4.2.

The graphs on the summary screen don't update properly. These might be two different
bugs.

1. After going into the reviewer and tapping the back button, the graph ends up looking
like one on top of another (see screenshots). Touching the graph makes the top one
disappear, so it looks like a painting issue instead of two actual graphs.

2. The graph (that remains after the top one is cleared) isn't updated. If you do some
reviews and tap the back button, the graph you get is the same one as before the reviews.
Selecting another deck and then back to the one you reviewed with updates the graph
as expected.

Reproducible every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1492 What steps will reproduce the problem?

Clicking the sync button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I just moved from CM7 to CM10 after a phone crash. I installed AnkiDroid back, and
now my ankiweb decks won't sync properly, displaying instead some other decks (tutorial
and another one about Mr Goethal, actually the ones I can see in the anki folder).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

I happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

v1.1.3

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

4.1.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

If you complete a deck and choose to review early, a new dynamic deck is created. The
first screen you are taken to is not the usual screen for dynamic decks, but for normal
decks. Thus, it's not possible to change options and rebuild without leaving the screen
and going back into the dynamic deck.

See initial vs expected screenshots.

Previous versions of AnkiDroid used to show the total number of new cards including
the ones that were suspended. The current desktop client doesn't include suspended
cards in the count (I think this was changed in 2.0.3).

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
AnkiDroid: 2.0beta20 (fresh from github)
Android: 4.0.3

If it is a crash ...
It is not


Please provide any additional information below.
IIRC, the desktop Anki always goes back to showing the question when you return from
the edit dialog, even when not moving cards. That seems a reasonable approach to dealing
with this.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1505 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Press sync button
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
At the end of synchronization a dialog box appears with the title:
&quot;Sync Log&quot;, the text &quot;disk I/O error:COMMIT;&quot; and an &quot;OK&quot; button

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
All the time


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
AnkiDroid v2.0beta21
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
2.3.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

The results of typed answers (on the answer side) always appear the top instead of
being inlined in the original location in the template. 

There's also no complete comparison with the proper answer if the typed part doesn't
match, which the desktop version shows. See screenshot comparisons. I don't know if
this was intentional (to save space on mobile screens, for example).

If AnkiDroid is killed where the last activity had been the reviewer, then, when resumed,
you can't go back to the deck picker.

Pretty sure this was introduced in beta 21.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1518 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have a font with Hebrew characters as the System Font
2. Do not have any fonts in /Ankidroid/Fonts
3. Use a deck with Hebrew text
4. Notice that all Hebrew text is displayed as squares.

Note that putting the same font with Hebrew glyphs into /Ankidroid/Fonts makes the
Hebrew glyphs render in the note review screen, so Ankidroid is usable, but the other
screens (fact edit, deck list, main deck screen) still show squares instead of Hebrew
glyphs.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The user expects Ankidroid to use the System Font's Hebrew glyphs.

It seems this library not used (at least I could not find its use) but finds its way
to apk. And while most of android phones have arm processor inside, this library does
no harm. But my phone is mips-based, so installing fails. But if I manually remove
libZControllerLib_Android.so, AnkiDroid works just fine.

If it is possible, please remove libZControllerLib_Android.so from binary builds.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1524 Thanks a lot for all the time you've put into fixing the display problems for Hebrew
vowels! It's already looking much better, but there are still some serious issues.
I've mentioned everything I spotted but not all of the issues are equally serious.

I've create a small deck for testing: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2812525236.


CARD 1

The first card of the deck uses two fonts, which have been included in media and css
via @fontface: &quot;Ezra SIL&quot; for the whole card and &quot;Cardo&quot; for the transcribed words
(in green). I've taken screenshots on Win7 (Anki and AnkiWeb) and two Android devices
(AnkiDroid and AnkiWeb): see attachments.

In summary:
1) Display on Anki: perfect.
2) Display on AnkiDroid:
   a) With Tohu.ttf (AnkiDroid workaround for Hebrew vowels): very good (but see below).
   b) Without Tohu.ttf: for some reason, on Android 4 (tablet), even though &quot;Ezra SIL&quot;
is for the card overall, the Hebrew words are displayed in the system font. The vowel
positions are reasonably good, better than on Android 2 (HTC Desire with Cyanogenmod),
which uses &quot;Ezra SIL&quot; for the Hebrew words.
3) Display on AnkiWeb:
   a) Chrome on Win7: perfect.
   b) Dolphin on Android 2 (Cyanogenmod): perfect.
   c) Dolphing, Chrome or native browser on Android 4: same as 2) b) above.

Have you got any idea why 2) b) and 3) c) happen?


The other cards demonstrate some issues I have encountered with the AnkiDroid Tohu.ttf
solution.


CARD 2

This card contains a list of all consonants and the main vowel-combination. Anki displays
all correctly (except for pure vowels, which are only needed for grammar decks). But
AnkiDroid has the following issues:

- Dageshes are not displayed correctly, especially for the narrow letters, but also
for צּ and שּ.
- Shevas and central, lower vowels (qames, hireq etc.) are not in the right position
for גְ, דְ, וְ, זְ, יְ, ךְ, נְ, רְ
- holem overlaps with לֹ


CARD 3

This card has a few lines of Hebrew text, which also includes accents. It shows that
Tohu.ttf has inherited the Cardo.ttf-bug of overlapping lines. Also, it displays the
line from bottom to top.
And, in addition to the issues of card 2, it doesn't distinguish holem waw (the central
letter in יוֹם) from waw+holem (וֹ).


CARD 4

This card demonstrates that AnkiDroid does reverse the order of letters or letter groups
within words, if they are contained in span-sections (e.g. because they are highlighted
in different colors).


CARD 5

This card demonstrates that AnkiDroid sometimes revereses the order of letters, if
they are separated by dashes or spaces.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1527 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Create a new deck within AnkiDroid; it'll only have 2 facts set.
2.Add some cards.
3.Import the deck to desktop Anki.
4.Adjust layout to have more facts as needed (3, for instance); this step probably
&quot;corrupts&quot; the deck and I'll provide more details about this step below; I'll refer
to the deck as &quot;corrupted&quot; later on.
5.Export the deck back to .anki file, overwrite it in AnkiDroid.
6.Try adding new cards for the corrupted deck (different ways tried - from within deck's
main window and from cards browser).
7.See excuses about unfortunate stop.
8.Loop to step 6.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected is card edition window with 3 empty fields to type in. Crash dialog is seen
instead.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time for any &quot;corrupted&quot; deck.

AnkiDroid version: 1.1.3
Anki desktop version: 1.2.8
Android version: 4.0.3 (release5a), on Sony Tablet S

Please provide any additional information below.
&quot;Corruption&quot; step details: additional fact was added, fonts, colors and font sizes
were changed; new fonts were Glyph-oriented - MS Mincho, KaiTi (for aesthetic perception);
exported deck shows all glyph characters on droid-device correctly, though fancy fonts
are not working - it all casts down to plain Arial (I don't know, if AnkiDroid does
the conversion, or the fonts are missing on my device, or the Android itself doesn't
allow messing around fonts... Couldn't figure out). Now the corrupted deck may be edited
- all existing cards are shown properly, one might browse them all and edit any facts
as wished (though I havn't actually tried to save changes); the deck may be reviewed;
nothing seems wrong until you try to add a new card - it crashes instantly.
I tried to &quot;fix&quot; the corruption: opened the deck on desktop Anki, switched all fonts
explicitly to Arial and exported it; it WORKED in 1 particular case - the deck containing
just 1 single card was &quot;cured&quot; and now works fine. But this didn't &quot;cure&quot; my other
deck with 68 cards; I finally had to convert it to plain tabulated text and re-import
it to Anki desktop, loosing all schedule and layout info. This new re-assembled deck
works fine currently on Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1528 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Launch Ankdroid Samsung S3 that has clipboard bug
2. Open saved deck
3. Click &quot;Start reviewing&quot;
4. Watch it crash!

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect it to open my deck, but it crashes instead. My S3 currently has the 'clipboard
bug' http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1781060 but I don't want to root
my phone yet, so I have to put up with having no clipboard.

When I start Ankidroid, anki.Reviewer.onCreate calls into anki.Reviewer.clipboardSetText
which goes to ClipboardManager.setPrimaryClip and that eventually leads to a NullPointerException
because of a bug in Samsung's clipboard code.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yup, everytime.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
1.1.3

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.0.4


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

Attached.

Please provide any additional information below.

I know this problem isn't your fault, but I'd like to be able to keep using Ankidroid
without needing to root my phone at the moment.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1532 AnkiDroid beta 22 on Android 4.2.1 on Nexus 10 (tablet).

If AnkiDroid remains open while the next day (in Anki offset terms) ticks over, then
AnkiDroid seems to enter some bad state. The counts on the decks are not updated, and
if you try to review, you only get a white screen in the reviewer with the spinner
in the top-right. It looks like it's stuck re-loading the collection.

At this point I hit back enough times close AnkiDroid (which I believe closes the collection).
Opening AnkiDroid again shows only the splash screen, and it appears to be stuck on
it. Hitting back at this point crashes AnkiDroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1533 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. After the initial full sync do a review, and then sync again
2. The sync only transfers a small time, but it takes a very long time (10-20 minutes)
and uses a majority of the phone CPU
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

It's happened for the last 2-3 times I've done reviews on AnkiDroid, so I stopped using
it. I'm afraid it will do something to my collection.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1534 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1 . Turn on whiteboard 
2 . Find a card with text that requires scrolling to view. 
3. Try to scroll the screen by dragging the window. 

What is the expected output? 

The text should scroll so the lower portion is visible. 

What do you see instead?

Any touches to the text view screen will draw on the whiteboard. There is no way to
scroll the screen to view the entire text. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Occurs every time the whiteboard is active and cards are being reviewed. 

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

Not a fatal error. 

Please provide any additional information below.

There should be some way to scroll the screen when the whiteboard is active. Some possible
solutions :

1 Reserve a narrow strip on the right side of the screen just for scrolling, not usable
by the whiteboard. 

2 Provide a gesture just for scrolling,  like two finger dragging. 

3 Provide a button on the hot bar to allow quick disabling of the whiteboard.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1536 Hi guys,

I know you're concentrating on v2, but it would be great to fix this bug if it's a
quickie -- right now one can't share third-party app content with AnkiDroid in this
setup :(

Thanks!

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open the native browser or Chrome to any webpage
2. Select &quot;Dots -&gt; Share page -&gt; AnkiDroid card&quot;

What is the expected output? 
A new card is created

What do you see instead?
Crash: https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zilb-8TParo/UOHiI8b7YgI/AAAAAAAAphk/VLyiUcbbLu8/s512/Screenshot_2012-12-31-11-02-54.png

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one
time?
It happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

Cards have a dark bar on the right which cuts through the text.

I expect either dark bar not to be present, or text to word wrap.

Only tried on new install of AnkiDroid.

Ankidroid 2.0beta22, android 4.1.2


De-installed Ankidroid 1.x, and installed above straight from http://ankidroid.googlecode.com/files/AnkiDroid-2.0beta22.apk
 - no previous 2.0 betas present.

It should work at least like (if not better than) version 20.
1. Negative time shows up for all the decks but it is not as frustrating as the second

Another issue is the &quot;&gt;1000&quot; that shows up for new cards when the number is (obviously)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1541 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Export card deck from Anki Desktop 2.03 (Windows)
2. Copy apkg file to /storage/sdcard0/AnkiDroid
3. Try to import cards in AnkiDroid 2.0 beta 22

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I should get a new deck of cards in my set. 
Instead I get an error message, telling me that no apkg files were found to import.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time, I could not import any file yet.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
The latest public beta as of february 2nd 2013: 2.0 beta 22
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Android 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.1.10+

The device is an Acer Iconia Tab A700 tablet.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

I have attatched the card deck which failed to be found by Ankidroid to get imported.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1544 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Select a dynamic deck which is a sub-subdeck (third level)
2.The four icons of (adding), browsing, statistics and settings at the bottom of the
deck screen cannot appear because there is no more room for them because of the long
explanation text of how a dynamic deck works just below the deck name ('This is a special
deck for studying outside...').
3. Browsing, statistics and settings cannot be clicked on.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Icons of (adding), browsing, statistics and settings are expected to be seen
Just 1-2 rows of pixels can be seen.

Making it possible in the main settings to enable and disable the explanation text
to be appeared would be a quick and practical solution.
I have formed a three-level deck system for an effective language learning. I would
appreaciate it if I could use third level dynamic decks.
Many thanks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1550 In anki 2, ankiweb lists an empty deck named &quot;default&quot; which can not be deleted. This
deck does not show in the anki desktop client, but it does appear in ankidroid. I assume
there is some technical reason why this deck has to exist.
Since this deck does not contain any data, I would prefer it to be hidden from the
deck list.

It does not crash. It just didn't bring over the decks I was using before.

Please provide any additional information below.
I have spent now 3.5 hours trying to get my old decks working. And I am vary unhappy.
I can not understand why they would not make the update in a way that would just bring
over all the settings and data of the older version of Anki. Any why wold it not open
the old files .anki whey the previous version would do it every time. I also keep the
files on my MicroSd card that way I could study at school on there computers with the
wondows version of anki. That still works just fine. It opens that files no problem.
but now it does not work anymore on my Azus Transformer prime tablet.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1559 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I created a new deck with my Windows-PC (Anki 2.0.3),
2. synchronized it with my account@Anki and than
3. I synchronized it with my Android-Phone.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I created on my pc on the front-side of the card two {{type:&quot;xxx&quot;}}-fields, which are
used at the backside too (to compare the answers). At my PC works everything very well.
But if I open the deck on my Android-Phone, it doesn't work (enclosed a screenshot).
For example, Ankidroid shows only one of the two input-fields. The second-one appears
as code-line. And the process of comparison doesn't work also.

happen only one time?
Every time.

least the user knows what this path is supposed to mean. Some (most?) file browsers

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1563 On AnkiDroid v2.1alpha1

If you select the Import Cards menu option, you get a dialog box telling you to place
your apkg file in some location and then clicking &quot;OK&quot;. If you leave this window (say,
to go to a file manager to move the apkg to the right place) and go back to AnkiDroid,
that menu disappears, so you can't click &quot;OK&quot; to continue importing. Going to back
to the menu and clicking Import Cards doesn't show a dialag anymore. You need to close
AnkiDroid (back button) and open it again for the dialog to start working again.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1564 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.open a deck and view the first card where there is sound track in the question box
2.press 'answer' 
3.the loudspeaker icon disappears and I can no longer hear the audio (this is Jap6000series)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to be able to hear the audio, so as to hear it as I read the Japanese : but
I can't 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time, every deck

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) The new one (version 2) that you automatically installed WITHOUT MY ASKING
FOR IT(GRRRR) 
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) LEPAN


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
Best, tell me in simple terms how I can go back to EXACTLY as it was before (I am 70
years old and can't understand your horrible turgid prose in your prolix instructions)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1569 Recent Anki desktop versions make it easier for people who previously used the Anki
1.2 selective study feature. While users in many cases may be able to create subdecks
for each of their lesson tags, that requires the desktop version to set up.

- AD currently only shows 'custom study' from the finished screen, meaning users can't
use the 'limit to tags' option until they've finished the deck first. It should be
in the menu (or even on the screen).
- The 'limit to tags' option currently presents a very tiny input box where users have
to manually type the tags. The desktop version instead displays two lists of tags allowing
users to select and deselect the tags they want (just as in 1.2's custom study), which
makes selection a lot more user friendly. A similar feature is coming in the next AM
release as well.

AnkiDroid should follow the naming convention to make cross-referencing with the documentation
easier.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1577 Anki 2.0 manual (&quot;Changes in Anki 2&quot;) recommends the following method of selective study
instead of tag-based one:
==================================================
If you were using selective study to control introduction of new cards (such as blocking
lessons 5-18 from being displayed), you could also convert each lesson into a deck,
but that’s somewhat cumbersome. An easier method would be to suspend the cards you’re
not ready for, and then unsuspend them on a per-lesson basis when you’re ready to study
them. You could do it like this:
    1. Search for &quot;tag:lesson* is:new&quot; to find all new cards with a lesson tag. Select
them all, and suspend them.
    2. Assuming you were halfway through lesson4 before upgrading, search for tag:lesson4
is:new&quot; and unsuspend any cards that got suspended by the previous step.
    3. When you’re ready to move on to lesson 5, search for &quot;tag:lesson5&quot; and unsuspend
the cards. 
==================================================

But using expressions like &quot;tag:NNN&quot; or &quot;is:new&quot; seems not working in AnkiDroid Browser.
I also did not find interface elements like &quot;Select all&quot; and &quot;Suspend&quot;.

How to suspend the cards I’m not ready for in AnkiDroid?
If there is no way to do it in AnkiDroid, I'd like this to be added to the TODO list.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1590 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a new profile on Anki Desktop 2
2. Copy the attached collection (which was from AnkiDroid2) to Anki Desktop 2.
3. Try to open that collection on Anki Desktop 2

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: Being able to open the collection on desktop.
Observed: &quot;Your collection is corrupt. Please see the manual...&quot;

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) v2.0
AnkiDesktop 2.0.4

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) 4.1.1


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

File is 14 MB, too large. I can send it through email to someone.


Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1592 As per below thread in the forum, getting multiple hits for a query and not having any

AS a minimum I think it should be added to the top of the &quot;card details&quot; screen.

Additionally, the deck name is very useful info, especially when searching the whole
collection, but this information can easily be found by opening the entry. So until
Issue 1310 to make 2nd column customizable is implemented, it may make sense to change
the second column back to the card direction as well. Thoughts?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1595 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Go to deck list
2. Long-press the &quot;Default&quot; deck until menu appears
3. Press &quot;Delete deck&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The Default deck should disappear, but nothing happens. When I try the deletion on
the website, a message informs me that the default deck can't be removed - which seems
stupid (my other decks are organized by language, so what's the point of having a &quot;default&quot;
deck?); but even more stupid is the current AnkiDroid behavior.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This is repeatable.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1596 The about page needs to be updated to change to v2 screenshots, update list of features,
and give a new link/description for the main Anki documentation.

The installation page has a section on custom fonts, but there is also a separate wiki
page for using custom fonts. I think the section in the installation page could probably
just be deleted, since I doubt anyone is using older than AnkiDroid 0.7 anymore. Thoughts?

I have updated the FAQ

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1597 I have 37104 files in my collection.media/ directory on the desktop version of Anki.
 When I try to move them to the sd card of my phone to use with AnkiDroid (either through
the sync functionality of AnkiDroid, or through manually copying them over), I get
errors that there are too many files in a single directory (the collection.media/ directory).


Is there any way to work around this?  I would be happy with an option like &quot;Don't
Download/Sync Media&quot;.  Or maybe an option not to download/sync specific decks from
Ankiweb.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1599 It would be great to have an option in settings that allows to skip cards during reviewing
where I have to type in an answer, and leave those cards for a desktop version to deal
with.

Typing on a mobile device is very slow comparing to touch typing on a full keyboard.
I know there is an option in AnkiDroid &quot;Write answers&quot; which I turned off, so I wouldn't
need typing, but I don't want to answer cards without typing if it is required by a
method of learning (by this I mean a type directive in a question field). It would
be inaccurate.

Now I have to suspend these cards when I get them during reviewing (which slows me
down as well), and when I'm back at the computer I have to return them from suspended
to finish reviewing.

I learn several languages, have lots of cards and spend a lot of time reviewing, so
this inconvenience is really cost me hours.

I'm sure there must be others who deals with this issue in one way or another. I think
my suggestion can be a good option.

Please.

And anyway thank you very much for your app!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1601 On some devices, internal storage might be much faster than external storage. In that
case, a user might want to store the decks in the internal storage, which is currently
possible by changing the directory in which the decks are stored.

However, in that case, it is not possible to copy the decks out of internal storage
nor access the backups.

Probably backups should always be stored on the external storage and there could be
an option to copy from the internal to the external storage, probably as the export
feature offered by Anki 2 on the desktop.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1602 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. See localization files source (for example https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/Anki-Android/blob/master/res/values-pl/01-core.xml#L123)
2. In plural section there are only two forms (one, other)
3. Crowdin does not let you define the 'few' form (http://crowdin.net/translate/ankidroid/7290/en-pl)

Please provide any additional information below.

I tried to start a discussion on the Google Groups page, but my message still does
not appear after waiting the whole day, so I report a bug.

With only two forms you cannot prepare a translation that will not look silly for a
native speaker.

I could provide a fix this by making a pull request on GitHub, but looking at your
/tools/manage-crowdin.py I'm afraid my changes will be lost at first synchronization
with Crowdin.

advice provided by Tim on the forum (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/anki-android/Bxfw37_j-rw/6GQXeMTKg4YJ).
Also, I followed the upgrading instructions posted on the website and have had no issues
with the version of Anki I'm running on my PC.

I am including my collection of cards and the SendLog, in hopes that it helps you to
solve the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1608 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. open the card list for a single stack
-- list all stacks
-- open a single stack
-- click the second button to list all cards in that stack

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Observere that with ankidroid v2 the list is no longer usable as a personalized dictionary.
If you have the fact that &quot;blue&quot; translates to &quot;blau&quot; in German, while &quot;red&quot; is &quot;rot&quot;,
with ankidroid v1 this would appear as:

blue    - blau
red     - rot

Now it appears as:

blue    - German Deck Name
red     - German Deck Name

Obviously it is no longer usable as a personalized dictionary that way.
Moreover the presented information is totally useless,
as it will be the same for every single entry.
Thus it does not provide any additional information,
and is redundant with the title of the screen.

Expected output:

a personalized dictionary, e.g.
something similar to the output of ankidroid v1



Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?
Or did it happen only one time?

100% reproducible, seems to be by design

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1611 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open AnkiDroid.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect, after a few seconds, for AnkiDroid to show me a list of my decks. Instead,
the initial loading screen with the spinner stays there indefinitely.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
Can't get to the decks list to check. I'm pretty sure it's 2.0.4
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Android 4.1.2


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
Not a crash.


Please provide any additional information below.
I've been creating and reviewing cards on the desktop version and synchronising them
to the server, but haven't been able to open them on AnkiDroid since I connected it
to my sync account.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1612 An export collection to apkg function as exists in Anki Desktop (whole collection, or
individual decks) is necessary because the AnkiDroid .anki2 database is not directly
compatible with the desktop .anki2 database due to WAL as per issue 1590. The recommended
method for copying the collection to PC should therefore be to export to apkg.

It would also allow users to remove certain decks from their collection without deleting
them entirely if they want to come back to them later as reported below:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1614 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a new card by dragging a 300 by 300 pixel jpg image from a web page to the
&quot;Front&quot; field of a new card
2. Type text for the &quot;Back&quot; field of the card.
3. Study the deck with the card and view the answer screen for the card. The text from
the &quot;Back&quot; field is mostly covered up by the buttons with &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, or &quot;Easy&quot;.
To see the answer you need to drag the image up.

What is the expected output? I expect the image and the answer to fully display at
the same time without being covered up by the response buttons.

What do you see instead?  The answer is mostly covered by the response buttons.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?  It happens every time.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) AnkiDroid v2.0
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

Most times, we need to totally uninstall the previous app and lose all our settings.
This is usually as a result of duplicate signatures used by Anki apks. Please avoid
doing this so we don't have to enter our settings for every beta. Thanks for doing
a great job.
Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1617 Hi,
I want to prepare a professional quality deck on CFA material in Ankidroid and make
it available for a price (not free)
Let me know whether that's allowed
Right now,you need to install Ankidroid and then go to 'download decks' to dowload
any decks needed.Is it possible that Ankidroid preloaded with my CFA deck be made avaible
in Google play.If someone buys it,he'll get CFA deck in Ankidroid(he/she can download
other shared decks if he/she wants to.)

Thanks for your help

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1622 It was much handier in the previous versions of anki desktop and mobile that search
in browser was done as i typed. That allowed to easily search for many different versions
of one stem or word part in a short time - for example, i typed in &quot;aus&quot;, then added
&quot;ausz&quot; and got results instantly, without pressing any button. Now when auto-search
has been turned off it is irritating to make an extra click on &quot;search&quot; button or &quot;enter&quot;
every time when searching a small variation of the word or word stem I am looking for.

I understood that this feature was turned off due to motivation to make the browser
faster for large collections, however in my collections of ~1000 entries it worked
perfectly. Therefore I propose to introduce an option to switch auto-search on or off.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1623 Please explain your idea here.
I loved to use the 'New Practical Chinese Reader' Flashcards on AnkiDroid on my mobile
before the big update of Ankidroid.
In the past, I could choose, from which lesson, book or list I wanted to learn, I could
chose it by the tags of the words.
Now this function seems to be gone and I just have to start from the first word, I
can't choose from where I want to start learning.
Also the Cram function seems to be gone.

There is a function to filter the words by tags, but I can't seem to set it and then
only learn the tagged words.

Can you redevelop this function please?

Thanks a million!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1625 A relatively minor issue, but when a note type is created on AD, it looks like this:

 .card {font-familiy: arial; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; color:black; background-color:
white; }

On the desktop it looks like this:

.card {
 font-family: arial;
 font-size: 20px;
 text-align: center;
 color: black;
 background-color: white;
}


The linebreaks make it a bit easier to identify what each section does, and are how
things appear in the intro videos.

Hi I actually wanted to contribute to the project. I 'played' with the application
for a while and noticed that when you go from the starting page where you choose the
deck you want to view, and 'click' on the button at the bottom of the screen which
takes you to search for cards that you have installed(the second button from the left
with the 3 little rectangles), if you want to go back to the home page, you need to
press the back button of your phone.My opinion is that you should also go back to home
screen by pressing the icon of the Application at the top left corner of your screen(this
is for OS above Honeycomb).So I added that minor 'enhancement', I hope you will add
it to the App :-)
So basically I went to the CardBrowser.java and added a few lines of code at the OnCreate()
methode.
Cheers
Sokratis

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1639 Problem:

When using Anki to learn foreign language vocabulary, words in both languages can have
multiple translations (polysemy), depending on meaning/context. This leads to possible
duplicate values, and AnkiDroid will not allow the note to be saved. 

In Anki Desktop, I created an additional &quot;Context&quot; field (*) which is displayed in
a small font under the word to be translated. But I cannot edit this field in AnkiDroid
because it disables the Save button when a duplicate value is detected. 

Workarounds:

1. Only edit these cards in Anki Desktop (but most of the time that I spend with this
deck, I am away from my desktop computer)

2. Add contextual information to the Front/Back fields (messy, adds formatting to field
values, and you have to edit the description twice, restricts the full power of the
field/note/template architecture)

Preferred Solution:

Add a new per-deck option for duplicate value checking, with three values:
* DISABLED - no check
* ENABLED - check for duplicate values and indicate by changing the text field style,
but do not prevent saving the card
* BLOCKING (default) - check for duplicate values, indicate by changing the text field
style, and prevent saving the card (current behaviour)

(*) actually I created two direction-specific context fields, and one bidirectional
field, and used conditionals in the card templates to decide what - if anything - to
show.

Steps:

1. Loaded AnkiDroid 2.0 for the first time
2. Attempted to sync (prompted to log in)
3. Entered my email address as Firstname.Lastname@gmail.com and got invalid username/password
twice.
4. Tried a third time with lower case email address (firstname.lastname@gmail.com)
and login was successful.

My keyboard automatically uppercases the first letter in the username field so this
could be a common reason for login failures.

AnkiDroid v2.0
Android 4.0.4

If someone receives a deck via email and tries to open it in the Gmail App they get
the following error message:
Info: No app can open this attachment for viewing.

If a user downloaded a deck directly to their Android as .apkg file, the user should
be able to tap on the .apkg file and Ankidroid would automatically import the deck
for them.


Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

This feature is available on Anki desktop for Windows and Mac. You double click on
a .apkg file and Anki automatically imports new cards.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1644 This isn't a huge issue, but I've noticed that my AnkiDroid2 folder has hundreds of
these hidden fuse files accumulating. I'm interested to know under what conditions
and why are they generated? I never saw them in AnkiDroid 1.

Using latest beta on 4.0.3. I've attached two of the recent files. I seem to get several
new files every day.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1645 Deleting and importing cards is too slow. What takes less than a second on the desktop
can take more than 30 min for large decks on AnkiDroid. Clearly my PC CPU is not 1000x
faster than my Galaxy S2, so the code itself is doing something really inefficiently.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1646 Currently AnkiDroid returns the message &quot;known issue, pending investigation&quot;  if there
is an existing instance of the crash signature. However, I think &quot;pending investigation&quot;
gives a misleading impression to the users that the bug is being worked on.

Rather than showing this message to the users when there are other instances of the
crash, I think it should only be shown when it is actually linked with an issue on
the tracker. I think a better approach would be to display the crash ID to the user
and ask them to post it here if the crash is persistent.

I think this is especially important for the current version as there are still quite
a lot of bugs.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1650 Hi..

I have an account at ankiweb.net and I'm able to login too..

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1654 If any of the media contain wildcards (i.e., '*' and '?') or invalid characters as far
as the FAT filesystem is concerned (like ':') sync will fail. For the user this might
seem to work fine if they are using platforms (like Linux and Mac) where these characters
are allowed.

Note also that this would fail on those devices where the file system is FAT, but would
work on those that use ext3 or ext4.

Not sure what the solution would be. Maybe communicating this better to the user?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1655 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Using ankidroid again. I'm putting this in the problems section as I was adviced
to on the other list - apparently if statistics show up in the desktop version, they
should show up in the ankidroid version too. However, feel free to move to the enhancements
section if it actually belongs there.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expected to see a review (written) just like in ANKI 1 - number of total cards, mature
cards, new/young cards and unseen cards. All of that seems to have been removed from
ANKI 2 android app for some reason. 

Instead I just see some colourful barcharts which are difficult to work anything out
from.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Everytime. On the desktop anki these written stats are still available.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)2.0
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) 4.1.2


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

This is obviously not an 'error' as such, but a very useful feature of ANKI 1 appears
to have been removed in ANKI 2. If this can be readded in future upgrades it would
be very helpful. Thank you Damien for all your hard work once again.

- Also note, that the app will allow me to enter whatever string there, such values
clear the existing text, but I assume internally a more sane value is chosen.

--&gt; This is a separate issue but renaming the first &quot;Custom steps&quot; to &quot;Enable custom

Alternatively the interface can be reworked to use one single Custom steps entry, in
which an invalid/empty value enables the default values.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1663 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck from deck picker
2. Menu -&gt; preferences -&gt; General -&gt; change the collection path
3. Click back twice (close general, and preferences activities)

What is the expected output? 
Closing the preferences activity should open the deck picker with the new collection,
as it does if the preferences menu is accessed from the deck picker.

What do you see instead?
In this case chosen deck is kept &quot;open&quot;, leaving the app in an unstable state. It is
even possible to &quot;do reviews&quot;, although did not check if the review answers where stored.

Going back, goes to the old (already closed?) collection, and selecting a deck produces
the errors reported in the triage tools as:
http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_bug?bug_id=4412051

Please provide any additional information below.

The fix for this issue is important to prevent errors if the profile switching get's
implemented. I assume similar issues could be observed if it is not done carefully.

The same collection on my phone (Android 2.3) doesn't crash.

I've attached the collection that causes this. Checking the database on the desktop
client makes the problem go away.

Attaching a debugger reveals this detailed message at the point of the exception:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1666 What steps will reproduce the problem?
0. This is only reproducible on devices with soft-menu button on the ActionBar.
1. Open a deck (going to Study Options Activity)
2. Change language: Preferences-&gt;Langugage-&gt;...
3. Go back to Study Options Activity
4. Click menu button

What is the expected output?
Menu list is displayed

What do you see instead?
App crashes

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
Found on 2.0.1beta14, but exists since 2.0.

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Reproduced on 4.0.4, *cannot* reproduce on 2.x with hard menu button.
Don't know if it's reproducible on 3.x

Someone more android development knowledgeable please explain to me, why this is not
happening on DeckPicker Activity if both Activities have the same menu-rebuilding logic
in onMenuOpened.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1668 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Accidentally write three opening and two closing braces in the card template (`{{{Field
name}}`)
2. Don't notice the error because desktop Anki shows the field 
3. Review a card like that on AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

What i saw:
The field text is not show. Text after the the field also disappears.

What should happen?
Not sure. Maybe
*Parse things the way the desktop client does
*Or show an error
*Or show one opening brace and the field. (That's what i think would be the Right Thing.)

But i think it should not eat up other fields or text from the template.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

AnkiDroid v2.0
Android 4.0.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


no crash

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1669 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Clicking the &quot;about&quot; button in the main screen or study screen crashes Ankidroid
2. Trying to sync results in the error message &quot;Syncing error, type: 409, message:
Conflict&quot;
3. Trying to delete a deck results in Anki getting stuck in &quot;deleting deck&quot; screen
(longest I've waited is 20 minutes)

Happens every time. 

It's the most recent version; I downloaded it two weeks ago from the Market; but I
can't click the &quot;more&quot; button so I can't get to the &quot;About&quot; screen.

Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1671 Bug 3561092 has assigned 5 crashes that correspond to a different issue... or does it
have 113 crashes with a different cause?

For crashes on 2.0, exception &quot;android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabaseLockedException:
database is locked (code 5): retrycount exceeded&quot; was thrown,

In the same Bug, crashes 4067466, 3926164, 3929170, 3716036, 3563097, failed for &quot;java.lang.IllegalStateException:
database /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/collection.anki2 (conn# 0) already closed&quot;.

Currently the signature is generated by looking into the offending line in com.ichi2.anki
package, but between versions that is likely to be different code.

So, it could be improved by taking into account either:
- The exception class, the message could contain variable data (paths, numbers), or
- The stack of calls inside anki package (com.ichi2...). Ignoring the line numbers.

So for instance crash 4255054 has a signature:
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.queryString
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDatabaseManager.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker.handleDbError
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker$40$1.onPostExecute
at com.ichi2.async.DeckTask.onPostExecute
at com.ichi2.async.DeckTask.onPostExecute

An crash 3926164 has signature:
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.queryString
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDatabaseManager.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker.handleDbError
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker.onActivityResult

Hopefully that signature could be a little less version specific (i.e. the call chain
of similar crashes in different version should be the same), and help to distinguish
different crashes happening on the same line in different versions.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1672 I have several decks and I would like to study different number of cards for each deck.
But it seems that it's not possible. When I go to a deck settings and set the number
of daily cards to 15, it will affect on other decks too and all decks will show 15
cards/daily

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1675 As of AnkiDroid 2.0.1

A quick way to reproduce this is to open a deck, go to Options -&gt; Reviews -&gt; Space
siblings by up to, then enter &quot;4&quot;. After tapping &quot;OK&quot;, you will notice the value is
read back to you as &quot;3&quot;. 

Internally, that value, which is divided by 100, is being stored as 0.03999999910593033.
When you sync and open the options on the desktop, that value is also parsed as 3 (but
fixed when saved again). 

It's possible this can cause problems elsewhere, but for now I've only seen problems
with the options group values.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1678 First of all, I'm not sure if this is a problem with AnkiDroid or AnkiDesktop. I'm glad
to transfer it to AnkiDesktop if the problem is not with the Android version.

When I check the &quot;Review Time&quot; graphs on both system I notice there's a mismatch between
the values. In the attachments, this is clearly visible for &quot;today&quot; (i.e. the most
right bar): the AnkiDesktop version shows that my review exceeded 10 minutes, while
the Android version thinks its under 10 minutes.
My suspicion is that the ticks are not drawn correctly on the vertical axis, since
the other bars show conflicting values if you focus on the 10 minute mark.

AnkiDroid version: 2.0.1
AnkiDesktop version: 2.0.8

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1679 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. choose a deck
2. tap the wrench
3. tap reviews
4. tap maximum reviews/day
5. chose a number tap &quot;OK&quot;
6. go back to the decks screen
7. choose a different deck
8. tap the wrench
9. tap reviews 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

  I would expect this to be a per-deck setting, and that would be useful, since I want
a smaller number of reviews for a phrasebook than for vocabulary words. Instead setting
the max-reviews setting for one deck effects all of the others too.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

 It's reproducible every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1681 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create flashcard with text and large image underneath 
2. Pinch to zoom 
3. Release pinch in zoomed state 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

When zooming I expect the image to retain the same height / width ratio.
Instead, it seems as if the width is fitted to the zooming while the height remains
unchanged, making the image very long and thin and in many cases unreadable. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Happens with all image flashcards I have

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1682 Hi,

I think it might be nice to take into account user's time-zone in scheduling cards
for learning. It happened that instead of having Anki session around 8am I had it about
8-9 pm. Then the next day around 8am (the usual time for me) it turned out I had nothing
more for that day, even though it was my first session that day.
So I'd rather like having cards scheduled for a specific day starting 12am till 11:59
pm _localtime_.

Regards,
Tomasz

1. Add new card in Anki destop (windows 7)
2. Synchronize deck on Ankidroid 
3. Edit card on Ankidroid (swap + delete some trivial html tags)
4. See only the first row of the back of the card, the other rows are gone.

I see this problem for many times before posting this.

I think that there might be some problem with html tag handling in Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1685 Could the tags that I sue be displayed somewhere on the card? It would help keep things
more organised for me. For example, rather than have a deck for html, css, php, javascript,
I could just have a deck called with Web Design with html, css, php, as tags. I have
a few other things like that it would be nice to have the tags displayed rather then
have to make a special deck that was filtered by tags.

I just checked, and it appears that all of the other preferences and deck options in
Anki are available to edit in AnkiDroid, so this should be a complete list of the settings

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1689 1. Choose any deck and begin review
2. Touch anywhere on the white area
3. No markings appear but a scrollbar appears on the right side while touching.

When touching the screen while reviewing, no whiteboard markings will appear on the
screen. It behaves just like if the whiteboard feature is disabled even though it is
enabled. Also, a scrollbar on the right side.

No change after choosing &quot;Clear whiteboard&quot;.


It's the same basically every time. 

I have only been able to use the whiteboard once (suddenly started working after using
the app for a while, switching between decks) but not been able to make it work again.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1690 When importing cards from another app like colordict (imports mean adding (+) and using
&quot;saved data&quot; to get the shared data), AnkiDroid 2.1alpha2 (and versions before; on
Android 2.3.6) crashes when adding more than one vocab.

The added vocab is still in the &quot;saved data list&quot;, maybe this causes the crash?
To add more than one vocab, I have to go back twice (to the menu) and do the procedure
again. By this way, the saved data list is updated, the afore added vocab is, like
it should be, missing.

1. Create a Cloze note with the following content:

[latex]
Formula for a Gaussian pdf: $f_X(x)=\frac{1}{ {{c1::\sqrt{2\pi\sigma} }} }e^{-\frac{
{{c2::(x-\mu)^2}} }{ {{c3::\sigma^2}} } }$

This is a problem for other mixed LaTeX-Cloze notes as well.

2. Sync to AnkiDroid
3. Attempt to review it.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is what I see in Anki. It displays correctly there. In AnkiDroid,
I see a box with a question mark for all three cards generated.

happen only one time?
Every time.

This is neither a crash nor a force close. However, in the event that it proves useful,
I have included a log anyway.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1698 When the count of due reviews exceeds the normal scheduled number, I would like to prioritize
reviews over new cards. That is, new cards should only be shown when I am not behind
with reviews.

This was possible with AnkiDroid 1 by putting new cards to the end of the session.
I understand that the new configuration does not support this as there is no total
number of cards to learn per day any more. It would be good to have this back. As new
cards are reviewed twice now, it would make sense to count them twice when calculating
the total.

This is probably a change that needs to be addressed by Anki first.

I would expect the front of Forward cards to be displayed, and the back of Reverse
cards. It is impossible to scan for a card if you only know the back word. Also, there
is no column that identifies if a card is reverse or forward.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1702 I often use AnkiDroid in public places like buses or trains and don't want to play sounds
then. Muting sound globally in the phone is some solution, but it would be better to
add an option in preferences which when enabled causes AnkiDroid even not to try to
play a file (to save a few CPU cycles and battery life).

An extension to #1459.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1703 Hi there, I want to basically use ankidroid as a kind of SRS sound player. 
I'm basically just using cards that have sound on them (reading sentences) but I don't
want to look at my phone, I want my phone in my pocket.

It is almost there and I request 2 features:
1) when &quot;auto-answer&quot; is turned on, have an option (or just make this default) whereby
the &quot;answer&quot; which is automatically pressed after x seconds is simple nothing instead
of  selecting &quot;again&quot; every time. So this means that the cards for today will simply
keep rolling over in whatever order until I select one of the answers for that question.

2) I want to be able to lock the screen yet the cards will keep rolling. This can be
done a few ways I guess, the simplest would be to just create a fake lock in anki that
cuts the screen off and waits for a &quot;lock button&quot; press or something like that.

This whole idea could even be extended at a later date to allow the volume and lock
buttons to be &quot;answers&quot; so that i can simple listen and if i know this one i can press
the appropriate button without having to look at my phone.

Cheers!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1704 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I have only had this occur with two characters so far: ⺮ and ⻊. I created the card

2. I synced my phone (rooted samsung droid charge) via ankiweb.
3. I found that, both in testing mode and in browse mode, these characters do not appear
correctly.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead? When I enter ⺮ or ⻊ into a card
it is replaced with a blank rectangle.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? It happens every time.

information?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1705 When installing AnkiDroid and syncing immediately, a message &quot;Upload or download everything&quot;
appears.
At this point, the local data is empty, so uploading would not make sense.

Proposal: if local data is empty (only Default deck, with zero cards), then do not

This reduces complexity, and avoids the risk of erasing AnkiWeb decks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1706 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.create a filter card of any deck
2.Deselect rescheduling
3.answer again until it reaches the home deck leech threshold

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expect:I expect that with rescheduling off, the card will never be suspended after
it returns to the original deck. It should not even raise the amount of time I pressed
again.

What I see: card is suspended or the amount of time I pressed again on the cards are
still recorded

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time when the leech threshold of that card has been reach

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1709 I happened to study late one night. I noticed that Anki does not consider a 'day' to
have passed until 24 hours have gone by. So Anki showed me the new cards the next day
at night. Until then, the deck read 0,0,0.

What I'd like is for it to consider a day to have passed each night after 3am for example.
That way if I study at midnight, then go to sleep, I can then study the next day at
lunch, rather than having to wait until midnight the next day.

I hope that's clear.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1711 On my Nexus 4, running Cyanogen Mod 10.1 (i.e. Android 4.2.2), the widget never updates,
and when I go into the app it always 0 cards in all columns (after I've reviewed).

If I Force Stop the app and re-run, everything updates correctly.

AnkiDroid version is 2.0.1

This never happened on my old phones.  My *guess* is that AnkiDroid expects/needs to
occassionally get bumped out of RAM/stopped by the background OS stuff, but this never
happens on my phone because OMG so much RAM.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1713 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card in Anki Desktop using Image Occlusion 2.0
2. Open the card in AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
**I should see that the image is placed at the top of the screen on my mobile device.
However, now there is a significant amount of white space above the image, causing
part of the image to be outside the screen. On iPhone devices all cards created with
Image Occlusion appear to be shown properly. 
The problem is illustrated in the attached image.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one
time?
**It happens consistently.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

version)
**Android 4.2.2 with CyanogenMod 10.1



If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
**The program does not crash.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1719 I love the android Anki app and use it on the go very frequently. However, I am unable
to view a card in its 'normal view' (as if during review mode) when I search for it
through the inventory of the mobile app. I'm not sure if that makes sense. For example,
when I see the cards during a review session, I see the picture I included, the format
looks normal, ect. But when I search for the card individually through the inventory,
the card does not the show the picture but seems to be in some odd format (html?).
Is there a way to view the card normally without having to go through a review session
on the Anki app on android? I know I can do this through the browse button on the desktop
version. If this feature is available that would make this the mobile app so much better
(sometimes you forget a detail and want to go to that specific card rather than having
to go through a whole deck in review mode just to find it)!!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1720 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install AnkiDroid from market.android.com
2. Click on the menu icon at the top right
3. Scroll down (Image: http://i.imgur.com/kTNdk7S.png )
4. You can now see &quot;Restart upgrade process&quot;
5. When you click on it, you get this message: http://i.imgur.com/OhV2hM4.png

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
AnkiDroid v2.0.1

On what version of Android?
Android 4.2.2

What's the issue:

For a user, it's not clear what the effect of this action will be. Do I have Anki 1.x
files although I have AnkiDroid v2.0.1? Why is this the case? If I don't have them,
what will be the effect when I click on it? If it does nothing good, why don't you
hide this button for users with newer versions?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1722 The restart upgrade process menu item is taking up valuable menu real estate, and can
be confusing for users that don't know what it is (issue 1720). 

I suggest copying the iOS client by giving a button in preferences, which when tapped
removes the menu item, and the button itself from preferences. I think the code for
the button should also be called on first install/upgrade if there are no .anki files
in the AnkiDroid user directory.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1726 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I m using AnkiDroid to memorise some personal stuff and i dont want that personal
decks in my phone. So im changing path to a UsbDrive in Galaxy S3.
2. In first working it works well. But if you work AnkiDroid without UsbDrive it gives
fault and never works again.
3.even you plug your UsbDrive it wont work.At previous versions i didn't see that problem.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Its not working. I expect if you dont use UsbDrive it still works so i can change the
path to phone drive.

happen only one time?
I tried many times and result was the same. And please add password support to phone

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1728 The new approach is too complicated and somewhat messy. I don't want to have a bunch
of new decks. The way it was before was much better: simple selection if one wants
selective study. Also, the approaches based on having to write search strings not only
require knowledge of the proper syntax but it is annoying if one mistype, mispunctuate,
etc. Selecting options out of a menu or list is much better. 

PLEASE return to a simpler approach. It was great before.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1729 1. With Anki-PC (Version 2.08) I created a deck of 248 cards (text and pictures) and
everything worked fine.
2. I exported a apkg file for the Tablet-PC (Android 4.1).
3. As in the FAQ mentioned I copy this file to the Ankidroid folder, in my special
case
mnt/sdcard/Ankidroid
4. Then I start Ankidroid (Version 2.01) on the Tablet-PC and when I start the import-function
the pop-up tells me that the apkg file must be situated in the folderstructure
/data/data/com.ichi2.anki/files
and Anki reported 'No apkg file fond'!
This folder does not exist!
5. I created the folderstructure under
mnt/sdcard/Ankidroid
as well as under
mnt/sdcard
and copied the apkg file and tried again.
Same result: No apkg file found!
Where is my mistake?
Thanks for help.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1741 Hi!My english was very poor(sorry @_@),but I will try to express the issue.

1、I download the ankidroid new version 2.08 for PC.
2、My computer system was window7.
3、I keyin enlish words to the excel and save as *.CSV .
4、Than I open the csv file from notepad and save as *.TXT(UTF-8)
5、I use the ankidroid(2.08) try to improt the *.TXT,but I can't improt it,because it
can't find file.

6.But if I try to use the old version 1.2.8(PC),it can improt the files,so I think
this is a bug for version 2.08.

Please fix the bug and Ankidroid was a very good software for me.
I can use it to study English words.
Thank you very much.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1748 Hello!
I've been using Anki for quite a while now and I wanted to switch to Ankidroid... I
have a problem though.
In the Anki Desktop, I changed the note type [like in the video in the Manual] to the
one with the additional field where you can type in the answer, and it doesn't work
on Ankidroid.
Have I done something wrong or is it unavailable?
I've attached some pictures to make it more understandable!
Thanks in advance!

I'm using HTC Cha Cha, Android 2.3.5, the newest version of both Anki and Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1749 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Attempting to review recently added cards on a certain deck
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

So this is probably due to some setting I've changed and entirely my fault, but when
I review cards I've recently added to my deck, rather than seeing the normal three
choices at the bottom of the screen &quot;1 minute, 10 minutes, 4 days,&quot; I see &quot;1 minute,
7 days, 4 days,&quot; which isn't what I want at all.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time (but only for cards I added yesterday)

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

Please provide any additional information below.

Although the solution is probably quite simple, I can't figure out at all how to change
it back! I would be extremely grateful if someone could help me.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1751 If the name of a deck contains one or several apostrophes, the 'custom study'-option
after the regular session will not work properly (will find no cards). Renaming the
deck and thereby deleting all apostrophes from the name of the deck resolves the issue.
I propose to you to either fix this so that the search string works even with such
decks or simply to disallow any apostrophes in the names of the decks [NOTE: the desktop
version does not have this problem. custom study works for the very same apostrophe-containing
decks that on AnkiDroid would not]

PS: to avoid confusion, i refer to the custom study option you are offered once you
have finished your daily review. since it is not a problem i have no solution to anymore,
i chose 'propose an enhancement' rather than report a new problem. Sorry if i chose
wrong here :) great app btw

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1752 How about a button inside of every deck, that has three different states and can switch
the way, the cards are being shown:
1. state: all the cards in the deck are shown with their front first
2. state: all the cards in the deck are shown with their backside first
3. state: the program shows the cards randomly with their front or backside first.

Wouldn't this make the learning process much easier and also easier to handle the program
(no fiddling around the controls in the card editor and no time-consuming changing
of card types in huge card decks).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1753 Now my anki database has a peculiar behavior:

1. On ankidroid, create a new note; while creating select a deck
2. Open a list of decks and see that the new note appeared in a different deck, called
&quot;Svenska::Phonetics&quot;
3. Edit a list of notes and move a card to the deck you need
4. Now it looks as it should

I need to change the deck for each new note I create.
It never goes to the right deck during creation.

I believe it started after I tried to edit card templates.

I attach file collectiion.anki from my desktop ~/Anki directory. If you need any other
files let me know

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.0.1
On what version of Android? 4.0.3

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1760 release 2.1 alpha 4 editing is absolutely impossible to use.

I understand 2.1 is in alpha stage, but I just wanted to mention at the outset that
the way the editing goes in 2.1 is not workable. For most of us, especially if we are
creating cards on our android device, we will simply copy from one source and then
paste all the information in one note space, then divide that information among the
note spaces. The 2.1 system makes that simple process almost impossible.

It looks like you've tried to add greater functionality to the card editing process
in 2.1 , but I'm sorry to say you've lost the most basic functionality in doing so.


ALSO, it looks as though even in 2.1 the spacing (both new and mature) issue is still
not resolved. That is, no matter what the settings, new card siblings will continue
to be shown in the same session, and mature sibling cards (no matter the settings)
will also be shown very close together.




That all being said, let me also thank you sincerely and heartily for all the incredibly
great work you've all done!

Feel free to propose UI ideas below, for instance how to pass to the new card, rate,
etc :-)

Also, if someone can pledge to implement the feature if given glasses, please announce
it. If someone is ready to give glasses in exchange for development, please also announce
it below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1763 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set phone to Dutch
2. Open Ankidroid
3. Open statistics of any deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

&quot;Young&quot; and &quot;old&quot; in Dutch should be &quot;jong&quot; and &quot;oud&quot; 
Instead &quot;young&quot; (English, not Dutch) and &quot;verouderd&quot; (means &quot;outdated&quot;, not &quot;old&quot;)
is shown

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) v2.0.1

I think this info should suffice ;)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1764 In the 2.1alpha4, the editor is directly multimedia.
As most fields are usually non-multimedia, it would make sense to start with basic
editor, and have a button at the end of the text input field to access the multimedia
editor in case it is needed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1766 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Wireless router set to the wrong time (eg. incorrect adjustment for daylight savings
time).
2. Sync in ankidroid give &quot;sync error&quot;. Sync works fine on ankimobile.
3. Set router to correct time, sync works properly.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Normal sync.

happen only one time?

Consistent.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1770 No specific steps to reproduce; problem seems to occur randomly, at least a few times
during an average usage session. Very short (but clearly visible; it's pretty disturbing)
flickers of the entire display. Not specific to reviewing, it also happens in menus/other
screens.

This issue occurs on my LG Nexus 4 with stock Android 4.2.2 while using AnkiDroid 2.0.1.
AnkiDroid is the only app with this issue, so I don't think it's a device problem.
Factory reset didn't make a difference either.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1771 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a new card with the foreign language word on card 1 and the English word
on card 2 selecting the option to create reverse cards automatically.
2. When the card 2 displays and prompts for you to guess at what card 1 displays, the
&quot;Edit to customize&quot; words display.

What is the expected output? I should not see the words &quot;Edit to customize&quot;.  It is

I can easily switch between the view with the fonts “Quick update” off and with just

Apart from that the quick update seems to work :/

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1773 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Copying the deck from the desktop version to the sd card in android.
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The cards are being shown in prefixed order, from the first added fact, always in the
same way. Moreover, the cards are being shown without meanings, only words and readings
are visible. I would like to fix this problem because that's completely useless to
have an app like this. I use ankidroid for japanese language, I would like to view
my cards on android in a random order and with all the infos on them, including words,
readings, meanings and notes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens all the time I managed to transfer my decks on my mobile phone. Sometimes
it worked correctly but I don't know what was different and maybe that was another
version of the app, maybe this one have some bugs.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1776 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Add a new cloze card with the following:
[latex]Testing: {{c1::one}}, {{c2::two}}, {{c3::three}}.[/latex]

2. Use &quot;Unused Media&quot; to generate images for the cards.

3. Synchronize Anki, and then synchronize AnkiDroid.

4. Attempt to review the new cards.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I should see a LaTeX image, but all I see is a blue box. I don't have this problem
for LaTeX cards without cloze deletions. This is a problem as of Anki 2.0.9. I have
checked the media folder on my phone, and I can see the new LaTeX pictures there, so
I know that they're being generated and are syncing correctly.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

Please provide any additional information below.
Cards with cloze deletions within LaTeX blocks displayed correctly when generated in
Anki 2.0.8. 2.0.9 added functionality so that they would be generated whenever the
user selected &quot;Unused media...&quot;, so the modified code may be a worthwhile place to
start looking.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1779 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Change the collection path to one that is invalid. This is easy to do since the
path has to be typed in by hand.
2. Exit Ankidroid.
3. Restart Ankidroid. It will crash leaving the user no way to correct the collection
path error.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
  I would expect the app to fail more gracefully, saying &quot;collection path is invalid&quot;
and to allow the user to correct it through the apps GUI.

happen only one time?
  Every time.

Please provide any additional information below.

The only way to correct an invalid collection path setting is to delete the app and
reinstall.

Being able to browse to the collection and set the path that way would greatly help.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1780 From forum:

Our group (Cristina Sousa, João Casal e Nuno Afonso) has finished the usability tests
promised in a post weeks ago. We are concluding the reports and will share them very
soon.
During our tests we observed that the all the users had this problem. When we ask the
students to &quot;Get a shared Deck&quot; they searched for this option all over the app, forgetting
the Android menu button. Usability problem?

Idea:
How about we add a &quot;false deck&quot; that would look a bit different (maybe a dotted border)
that contains a button &quot;Download shared decks&quot; ?
It would be even more visible by beginners, since they usually have one or just a few
decks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1783 Cards consisting of images and Latex encoding are not viewable in the card browser.
Only the coding is seen in the card details. An option to view the card as it would
appear during normal review would be great, since cards with no text and only images
or latex cannot be viewed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1785 I propose the behavior of the plus button is changed so that it shows a dialog allowing
the user to choose between (new card / new deck / new shared deck / new filtered deck).

After adding a new card, AnkiDroid should ask the user whether or not they want to
add another card (to the same deck by default). This will allow users to continue to
add new cards in bulk with a single button press.

This idea is supported by a recent usability study from a group in Portugal: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/anki-android/nW_34OooSSk

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1786 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck with Anki Desktop
2. Edit the deck and change the background color from white to yellow
3. Edit the answers text color from default black to blue, red or green depending on
the genre of the nouns
3. Sync with AnkiWeb and then sync AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The background color should be yellow but it shows black.
The text colors are jammed (yellow instead of blue...)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? Yes, it happens with every new deck I add based on the same edition
changes.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) v2.0.1
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) This issue just refers to Android 4.1.2 running on my tablet (Samsung Galaxy
Note 10.1) AnkiDroid works fine with Android 2.3.4 on my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy
Ace).


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1787 I have duplicates in base.
For example:

First field in card:
Above
Second field
(prep.)

and another card
First field in card:
Above
Second field
(adv.)

If I want to change card &quot;Above&quot;, I can`t, because buttom &quot;Save&quot; is inaccessible. Why?
In windows version it possible to do.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1789 I understand the concept of/need for leech treatment of facts that are problematic.
However, forcing a fact into leech mode and suspending it in Ankidroid, while providing
no way to undo that condition is undesirable. Please, either add a user preference
item to inhibit leech classification in Ankidroid, or provide some way to un-leech
a frozen card. Otherwise, I have to go back to the desktop Anki to un-leech leeches.


Honestly, I'd rather be able to not have Ankidroid designate cards as leeches, but
would be happy with at least allowing me to un-freeze a card within Ankidroid instead
of having to go to the desktop Anki. This could also be considered a bug since leech
is a tag, but for some reason you cannot remove it from a card within Ankidroid using
the Edit Card screen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1790 What steps will reproduce the problem?
I don't know. I started up AnkiDroid today, and the problem appears.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The white AnkiDroid background is turned black, and the text is turned white. My cards
are configured to have a blue background with yellow text, but now they have an orange
background with blue text.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This is the first time it's happened, and I don't know how to change it back.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1791 Please explain your idea here.
hi,
when i study, i also use anki to look up a certain problem of my studies in my phone.
but is impossible to get useful info from the browser since its a mess due to html
code. in the desktop browser it works just fine. the attached pictures display the
view of the same card, one in the desktop browser, the other one in the mobile version.
isnt it possble to switch to a non html mode?
greetings Iglu

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.
available on anki desktop, yes

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1792 Some flash card apps allow you to reverse the answer with the question.  This feature
is good, but a level better would be to have a bank of questions with slightly different
wordings and therefore answers to choose from.  Say we are studying a topic and have
10 questions to answer to cover that topic.  There may be multiple ways of asking each
(or some) of the questions.  Say for example question 2 could be worded 3 different
ways.  We only want to see 10 questions or flashcards total, but when it gets to question
2 (whether working sequentially or in random order) it will randomly choose between
the three options for that particular question.  Giving the questions a tiered heirachy
would allow this.  Base questions could be integers while tiers could be designated
(2A, 2B, 2C, etc) or be decimals (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc).
Example:
Q2A. When approaching a traffic light with a Red Signal, what action should you take?
A2A. Stop.

Q2B. What colour would the traffic signal light be if you need to stop.
A2B. Red.

Q2C. In what situation would you encounter a Red Light telling you to stop?
A2C. When approaching an intersection controlled by traffic lights.

You would only need to answer one of the above questions to indicate your understanding
of the Rule.  But by having multiple questions that could be asked at this juncture
in the question bank, makes revision more varied and less likely to be parrot fashion
answers, but calculated.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1793 I'd really like to have a setting to move the answer buttons (show, again, good etc.)
to the top of the screen. This would make it much easier to use a smart phone to review
the cards with one hand. Now I have to support the phone with my little finger and
bend my thumb into a bad position. With the buttons on the top of the screen I would
be able to grip the phone and use my thumb naturally.

Actually quite many android apps are designed like this, like ASTRO file manager, contacts,
dropbox, etc.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1795 Details initially reported in Issue 1743, but creating a new issue in order to not take
over the original bug described there.

Crash report: http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_crash?crash_id=4994028

I failed to reproduce it with a file named &quot;b+={}$!@$~.jpg&quot;, so there must be more
to it.

@Zach:
Would you be able to provide more details about your device and the exact steps you
take to trigger the crash? I'd like to know how you first got a file with that name
on your device (USB, sync from desktop, etc), and whether it works on the desktop client.

Can you also tell us the language set in AnkiDroid and the system language as well?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1796 I have a mobile device that's non-standard, I can't find its firmware, no root app works.
Without root, I can't install the IPA fonts into system. The Phonetic symbols are all
displayed as white bricks.

Then I noticed this reply on stackoverflow :
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10051915/how-to-install-custom-font-in-android-device

--------
See here @CommonsWare answer, You cannot add fonts to an existing device, except as
part of a custom firmware build, or possibly by rooting the device.

but you can add fonts in your appliction. like:

 TextView txtvw=(TextView)findViewById(R.id.textviewname);

 Typeface typface=Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(),&quot;fonts/burmese.ttf&quot;);

  txtvw.setTypeface(typface);

Note: put your font in assets/fonts dir in project
--------

Could you implement this feature. to allow customized font in a non-system location?
It would be nice to have this ability on devices without root.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1799 I'm not sure how much work it would be, but I would like very much if (for problems
that aren't linked to an issue on here) the user was told the triage crash id, and
the template for submitting a new issue asked the users to post that crash id on all
new issues when it's available.

It can be a bit annoying always asking the user to find the error report on triage
and post a link, and quite often if the user isn't rooted or doesn't reproduce the
problem properly the error log that they submit is completely void of any useful information.

Additionally, it would be nice if the user could click on the error report from within
ankidroid and either be taken directly to the triage error report page, or to the issue
on here if it's linked.

2.If I select Certain Note type and add a word, go to a Browse
3. Check the word that I added just now. You could see the note type of the word changed
to another Note type. Please check attached files.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

happen only one time?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1803 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create a flash card showing the tags field
2. Add a tag containing a non-breaking space (U+00A0), for example &quot;zelfstandig naamwoord&quot;
3. Review the card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect the tag to be showed exactly as I added it, and exactly as the Anki program
for Windows shows it (&quot;zelfstandig naamwoord&quot;), but instead the word order is reversed
(&quot;naamwoord zelfstandig&quot;) and when a second tag is added the word &quot;zelfstandig&quot; appears
even after this second tag.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

problem with the smartphone.
2. there are two problems: again and again there are hang-ups of the App (also with
the tablet, Nexus 7)
3. and again and again, when I start the synchronisation with my smartphone (Samsun,
Galaxy S3), suddenly I become requested to make a full synchnronisation (because the
dates would be too different - but they aren`t!! Only one change, and this could happen!)
That means then, that I loos all changes - here or there on the server!!

Now in the meantime I have the bad situation, that the same files (on the smartphone
and on the tablet) become more and more different!!



What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

thank you in advance for your help - with best regards,

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1807 If AnkiDroid is not closed with the back button, intents targeting DeckPicker are ignored

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1808 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Synching Ankidroid takes hours.
2. Ankidroid downloads the entire media catalogue repeatedly, uses up all data bandwidth
(media is over 200 MB). It says:

Receiving media from server... 
Up: 28 kb, Down: 220179 kb

Then:

checking media counts... 
Up: 28 kb, Down: 220179 kb

3. It seems the entire media catalogue is downloaded again on every sync. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

This happens during each sync since i installed Anki on Android.

1. Log into Android with multiple user accounts (Nexus 7 with Android 4.2.2 here).
2. Try to setup sync account for non-primary tablet user.
3. Receive &quot;A network error has occurred&quot; immediately after clicking  &quot;Log in&quot;, regardless
of what is entered in the boxes
4. Switch to the main user on the tablet.
5. Try to setup sync. Everything works.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Sync account should be setup correctly also for non-primary tablet user. It cannot
be setup. It works correctly only for the primary user.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1813 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a flash card showing the tags field
2. Write a new non-capitalized tag instead of same capitalized tag that already exists
in the tag database (like history instead of History)
3. Add the new tag to the card so that when later adding new cards the tag is already
selected by default

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The noncapitalized and capitalized tags should be merged like they are in desktop and
when browsing tags in ankidroid browser. However they aren't. When creating new flash
cards the noncapitalised tag is selected by default in the full add note view at the
same time as the capitalized tag remains unselected in the add new tags list (and the
noncapitalized tag doesn't exist at the same time in the add new tags list). It seems
that the noncapitalized and capitalized tags work somehow independently and therefore
it is impossible to delete existing noncapitalized tags if the original tag was capitalized.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

it happens everytime

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

4.1.2

Additional information

Switching off and on the devise don't help. Only reinstalling Anki and deleting all
the related data manually worked but there should be an easier way to solve the problem.

The capitalization noncapitalization works vica versa

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1816 Whenever I try to review a deck, the screen starts to flicker (sometimes briefly shows
&quot;Opening collection, please wait&quot;) and then it returns back to the deck screen (the
one with the &quot;Start Reviewing&quot; button).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happened with a few, imported decks of my own, and with the Default deck with 2 cards.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
Tried 2.0.1 (currently available at Google Play) and the 2.1 alpha4 version from google
code.
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Rooted 2.1 on a Nook Simple Touch.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

I was unable to open any deck for reviewing. To isolate the issue, I have restored
the device to the factory state, rooted, installed anki 2.1 alpha4, added 2 cards to
the Default deck. Now the Default deck still won't open. The same thing happens when
I import my personal decks - none of them will open for reviewing.

I have an SD card; also tried to force anki to use internal memory (with no luck).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1817 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Launch Ankidroid
2. Starting a Study Session causes a force close

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Happens every time. I've cleared app data, cleared databases, resynced, but it always
crashes. Even crashes with an empty study deck.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 

I've tried both the latest 2.0.1 and the latest 2.1 Alpha.

On what version of Android? 

4.3 (on Nexus 4, build JSS15J, the latest AOSP build).


I've sent the crash logs via the reporting tool.


I haven't seen any further reports due to this, and I imagine this happens a lot during
new Android version releases, but it would be nice if I could continue studying my
flash cards!

Thanks for the great work so far!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1822 If you're using the option to limit your reviews each day, then you're most likely using
it in a manner where you in fact DO all of your cards and ignore the artificial limit;
the limit really serves to keep morale up since you can only see a portion of the due
count at a time and not the whole pile. 

For people using the feature in this manner (most users I would think), it becomes
pointless because as soon as we hit the custom study option (which most users will)
to increase daily reviews, we see the total sitting right there. This is pointless/counterproductive
since we can peek at the total in other ways, and I feel this should be removed.

Thanks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1823 A polished timeboxing feature built right into anki would serve a lot of people quite
well I think. This timebox would work by revealing the answer after x seconds, and
then marking the card wrong after x seconds if the user presses nothing. There is an
addon for this, but the time needs to be changed each time you switch decks (I'm thinking
the built in version would remember settings for each deck), and overall I think that
this is a feature that would be better off as a core part of anki.

I could describe how this feature would benefit every user and not just a subsection
because of how it seriously helps keep you focused and gives you momentum, or how 6
seconds per card vs 12 seconds can be the difference between a half hour and a one
hour session, or how willing yourself to spend less time per card isn't a comparable
solution, but I'd say just try out the desktop addon yourself for a few days, or use
ankidroid which has this built right in.

Thanks.

The “new day” should begin at 04:00, but instead it starts at 12:00 midday (this is
exactly the 8 hour difference between the time zones).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1828 I have made it so you can control the reviewing via keys,
Here is the code - http://pastebin.com/bwu4kp4h
I placed it right below the gesuture code, where executeCommand() is defined, and above
the 'Inner Classes' code/comment section.

Using this, you can map keys to KEYCODE_BUTTON_1 - 6 from a bluetooth input device
using BluezIME.

If there are only 2 or 3 answer buttons on the screen, KEYCODE_BUTTON_3 and KEYCODE_BUTTON_4
will select the nearest answer.
So if only failed and hard are shown, then the button to answer easy will answer as
hard.

KEYCODE_BUTTON_5 displays the answer and answers as the recommended answer, just like
the spacebar in the desktop anki.

KEYCODE_BUTTON_6 undoes the last card.

Thanks a lot :)

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1831 ** What steps will reproduce the problem?
The problem is unfortunately intermittent. I'd be tempted to blame the AnkiWeb server,
except that Anki for Windows usually can successfully sync when my phone cannot--both
over the same WiFi network. It's actually working at the moment, but has been an intermittent
issue for the last several weeks. 

1. Hit Sync on AnkiDroid, especially after doing a few reviews.
2. It will either hang early on in the sync process, at 0K up and 0K down.
3. The usual result is that it will eventually simply give a failure message saying
sync has failed. Alternately, at least once it crept up by a few K, then failed--corrupting
the deck and giving the options of restoring from backup or doing a full sync from
server.

** What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: successful sync. Encountered: usually sync failure apparently due to timeout,
but once a deck corruption.

** Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It's happened intermittently over the last few weeks.

** What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
I'm on a relatively high-latency connection to AnkiWeb, having moved a month and a
half ago from the USA to Bangladesh. If my memory serves me correctly, syncing worked
well for about the first month, but began to intermittently flake out in the last couple
of weeks or so. Though it may be entirely unrelated, I've also been occasionally getting
prompts within AnkiDroid to submit error reports, though I haven't encountered crashes
that I've been aware of. I'm on a Google/LG Nexus 4 running Android 4.3.

If there's any information that would be helpful to obtain the next time I see this,
I'd love to know what to record.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1833 Currently I adapt css with the mac and sync. But it would be nice to be able to do that
with my mobile phone, too! Or at least to adapt wrong font sizes per deck and not only
generally.
(I use Samsung S4, highres, I have to adapt don't sizes)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1835 hi dear developers

one of best feature in ankidroid flashcard is its ability to look up  words.

for do that user must :

1) While reviewing, long click on the word and select the text
2) Choose copy from the top panel (you many need to first tap button in top-right corner)
3. choose {look up in COLORDICT} from the main menu in right down corner 

as u can see it is a time killer and long process.

i want to ask if it is possible all of this can be done by just one click 

for example :

we can add lots of words as text to ankidroid without answer 
and instead of answer , when we push  {SHOW ANSWER BOTTOM} the ankidroid call it from
colordict or bluedict or so on (same same know but only by one click ).
by this the process of making flash cards  will be very short 
because the answer already exist in dictionary and it can be call from them .

as you know  colordict or bluedict have lots of dictionary whit human voice and pictures
. and also lots of encyclopedias like wikipedia run on them offline 
and if this feature (one click look up  )be available we can add every word and the
answer with voice and picture is available from those dictionary huge databases .

one click lookup , something like  { SHOW ANSWER } bottom  in the botoom of the main
word . 



thanks for your attention

with best regards

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1836 It would be nice if AnkiDroid switched keyboard layout when entering text fields, depending
on front and back languages (when possible). This can make adding of cards faster.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1838 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Select Deck &gt; Deck Preferences &gt; New Cards
2. Specify # New cards/day
3. Observe that all decks share the same # New cards/day

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I was hoping to have one deck with 15 new cards/day and one deck with 25 new cards/day,
but it doesn't seem to be possible when they all share the same setting.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Continuous.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Anki v2.0.1 on Android 4.3

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

Ankidroid on my tablet and on my phone but all of my cards are on my tablet. How do
I sync them or transfer them so that I have them on my tablet and phone? If this is
possible, can it be updated between the devices for example, if I add a card it will
automatically show up on the other device?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1841 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Followed instructions from the Ankidroid doc here https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/wiki/FAQ#How_can_I_use_custom_fonts?

and subsequently the main Anki docs to install custom fonts

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected the font to display correctly but it didn't

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes, all the time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
n/a

Please provide any additional information below.

The issue is the instructions are not clear here: https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/wiki/FAQ#How_can_I_use_custom_fonts?

because when one follows it to the letter the custom font is synced from computer to
web to mobile device and went into the &quot;/sdcard/AnkiDroid/collection.media&quot; folder,
which is where Anki computer stores it. Ankidroid, however, instructs us in the Preference-&gt;display
page that custom fonts needs to go to /sdcard/AnkiDroid/fonts. So I manually copied
the custom font file from /sdcard/AnkiDroid/collection.media to /sdcard/AnkiDroid/fonts
and it worked.

I guess I don't know the reason behind this design but it almost makes more sense to
put custom fonts under &quot;/sdcard/AnkiDroid/collection.media&quot; so Anki works consistently
across platforms.

But I realize a code change is a big deal so if the docs could be amended to tell users
this it might be helpful.

Thank you.

  I use a unicode font (SIL Charis) and a unicode keyboard to add combining diacritic
characters which appear properly in the unicode font. In 2.0.2 Beta 2 apparently the
&quot;default font&quot; setting isn't respected because when using the app the SIL Charis font
apparently isn't used, because the combining diacritics don't combine.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1849 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Select any deck from the main menu screen.  To simplify this issue, I only have
two decks that I made myself in August in Anki 2.0.12

2. Select &quot;Start Reviewing.&quot;  

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
After I select &quot;Start Reviewing,&quot; I expect to see the first card in my deck for that
day.  Instead, the screen stays still for a couple seconds, then goes black for a few
seconds.  After that I am back in my phone's main menu screen and there is a message
indicating that AnkiDroid has crashed.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time.  I used AnkiDroid for about two weeks--starting in August 2013--before
this happened, and it worked great.  One day I tried to edit a typo in a card using
the AnkiDroid interface.  After that, the program ran but felt unstable for a few minutes,
then this crash happened.  Now, as I said above, I can't open any deck without the
program crashing.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) v2.0.1
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
All decks work just fine when I use Anki on my laptop.

I loved AnkiDroid while it was working and think it is an incredibly useful program.
 If I can be on any use trying to work through this problem, please contact me any
time.  

Thank you very much for creating this program.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1856 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use Tanuki Ultima deck
2. See yellow text on white background
3. Switch to night mode and see dark blue text on black background.

I'm sure this is an easy fix, but I don't work with HTML much.  All posts about text
color are for those who want to do spiffy things with multiple colors on their decks.

I just want to read the text on my Android, and these color combinations make that
impossible.  How can I change all the text on all the cards to a simple black text
on white background for this deck?  

Or, ideally, have the deck use other color combinations that are more visible?

Please provide step-by-step directions, not &quot;change the HTML code&quot;.  I am very much
just a user, not a developer.

Someday, I hope to have time to figure out all the neat features Anki has, but right

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1857 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.  On Desktop, create a card with cloze deletion within LaTeX.  e.g. [latex]$\frac{{{c1::1}}}{{{c2::2}}
{{c3::\pi}} {{c4::i}}}\oint_{{{c5::C}}} \frac{{{c6::dz}}}{{{c7::z}}}$[/latex].
2.  Click Unused Media or Check Media from Desktop.
3.  Verify that the proper png files are created in the Anki directory on Desktop.
4.  Sync on Desktop.
5.  Sync on AnkiDroid.
6.  Attempt to view the cards on AnkiDroid.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Since Anki on the desktop has created all relevant media, you expect to see the images
rendered properly on AnkiDroid.  Instead you see an image-not-found icon.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1861 I had several notes with the fields containing simple sound tags:

 [sound:39 - old is walking?.mp3]

They worked fine in Anki desktop, but in AnkiDroid they would not play.

In AnkiDroid the card shows the Play symbol, but no audio is played.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1862 I am using Ankidroid with two devices Samsung Galaxy Note 1 and Samsung Galaxy  Tab
2  10,1.  At Anki version for Galaxy Note there is an option to see  the list of cards
for any separate deck, but this option isn't available  in Tab  version of Ankidroid.
There is also no option to sort cards in the list of cards using alphabet, what I think
would help to see whether new word is already in the list or not.

It happens every time. I have tried to sync my deck, it seems to sync normally but
the problem continues. I have tried to uninstall the application and reinstall it,
but the previous decks were automatically found and loaded, and the problem continues.
I have also tried different decks but the problem continues to happen.

On Android 4.3 the application SendLog doesn't work, and I can't get the log this way.

Please provide any additional information below.
I manually deleted the AnkiDroid folder under sdcard and reinstalled the app + redownloaded
the deck collection from AnkiWeb but it still didn't work. My phone had 750mb of internal
storage and this shouldn't be an issue

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1867 Writing your own cards has the side-effect of creating your own customized knowledge
base for the topic you're studying.

The search function also gives a very good interface to look up a specific information.
However, having lots of LaTeX code and images on the cards, it is not very useful to
just have the source code of each card available.
A simple &quot;view&quot; button would solve this problem, and in my opinion greatly enhance
ankidroid.

For now, I haven't found a solution to display, without having to learn it. This is
quite odd. 

For my purpose, the best solution would be to display the cards by default, when listing
the cards of a deck and offer an &quot;edit&quot; button to actually edit it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1868 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use a collection folder on an external SD-Card (e.g. with an ext4fs, see issue #1158
2. Stop Anki
3. Remove the SD-Card
4. Re-start Anki

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Anki should complain that it can’t find the collection.
Instead it crashes. Afais the only way to recover is to delete all app data and set
up all your configuration data, including the sync account again. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1870 Right now you can build cards that you can see and hear (text, graphics, animations,
videos, sounds).

I'd also like to build cards that you can feel, with an entry like [vibrate:(duration)(intensity)]
or some such. It would need to allow a sequence of vibrations, since my only interest
in this is one more way to present morse code.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1871 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Complete all scheduled cards for the day
2. Leave Ankidroid running, do not exit it
3. When the next day arrives and there are supposed to be cards available, no available
cards are shown
4. No amount of backing up to a higher level screen and re-entering the deck screen
will show that there are cards to study
5. Forcing an exiting the program at the OS level, then restarting the app will finally
reveal the new work to do

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- I expect that once work is available I will be told there is work to do and I will
be able to do it.
- I instead, I must force a halt of the program and then restart it to check if there
is any new work to do.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
- Happens every time

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

- Ankidroid 2.0.1
- Android 4.2.2

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
- Not a crash

Please provide any additional information below.
- A minor annoyance.  Whether is it is big problem is TBD.  E.g., forcing a halt of
a program could cause it to leave data or metadata in a bad state, later corrupting
or immediately corrupting a database.  Only the program architect knows the answer.
 For safety and user's piece of mind, it should be addressed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1878 Please explain your idea here.
In short, a clear-all-tags button.
If one sets tags on a new card, those tags are set automatically on subsequent new
cards, meaning when making a new card the user must manually uncheck each  tag from
the previous card unless they happen to coincide with the new card. A button to clear
all checked tags would be nice.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? 

Don't know

If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

On Android I see DIV between {{#easy}}..{{/easy}} expression with empty content. On
desktop application, the DIV between expressions is not displayed at all.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
All the time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1881 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Turn on text-to-speech in preferences
2. Open a deck and chose 'start reviewing'
3. Problem occurs

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It will do one of two things. Either it will (1) have a pop-up with an exclamation
point that says &quot;Text-to-Speech: No text-to-speech language available&quot; and continue
to review, or (2) go to a black screen and then after a while say &quot;unfortunately, AnkiDroid
has stopped&quot;. If it does option number 2, then going to preference and reseting text-to-speech
seems to help some, but instead of going to the blank screen and exiting it doesn't
work it just goes to option 1 again...


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Happens every single time, either (1) or (2)...yet there may have been some kind of
initial problems with the setup because I haven't gotten to work at all yet. It seems
to work fine without text-to-speech though.

I'm not sure if it is...if it goes to option 2 it opens up a problem window and lets
me send a report somewhere. Not sure where it goes but I sent one.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1882 I often copy snapshots from pdf's into flashcards.  Generally, this works pretty well.
 Recently, I have found that many of the flashcards I have made show blue boxes with
a question mark wherever I have pasted a picture.  I do not know what determined which
pictures would be lost and which would not.  I also have no idea how to recover the

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1883 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use Nexus 5 (KitKat)
2. Create a card with a field that has the following properties:
   a. There is at least one Kanji and one Kana character
   b. There are Furigana markers (in square brackets) over a Kanji, but not including
the Kana
   c. Use furigana: to display that field
   d. Examples:
       奥行[おくゆ]き
       やせ 細[ほそ]る
3. Review the card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expect the bottom and top of the Kana and Kanji to be horizontally aligned,
with small Furigana on top of the Kanji. Instead I see the bottom of the Kana aligned
with the center of the Furigana, and the top of the Kanji is vertically lower than
the bottom of the Kana.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens reproducibly, with different fonts and font sizes.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

This is on Nexus 5 running KitKat (Android 4.4). On my previous phone Nexus 4 (Android

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1884 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enable the setting not to switch off the screen when in review mode
2. Start reviewing
3. Switch off display
4. Attach phone to power cord - the screen is automatically switched on and won't be
switched off automatically

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
If I'm not in review mode, the screen is automatically switched off after attaching
to power cord after about 1 minute. In review mode it is never switched off. You can
always see the login screen.
The same happens when I receive a notification e.g. because of incoming emails while
I'm in review mode and the screen is switched off. Only that it takes a few seconds
until the screen will be switched on after the notification sound.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

AnkiDroid is version 2.0.1
Android is 4.1.2 on Samsung Galaxy S3

would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

Please provide any additional information below.
This behavior results in excessive battery consumption while the phone is in my pocket.
So it would be nice if you could fix it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1886 If you are in the deck browser, you can filter by tag. You are presented with a list
of tags, and you can check more than one; but the tags are and-ed together. There are
times when you want to use &quot;or&quot;. For example, you might want to select  &quot;tag:lesson1&quot;
or &quot;tag:lesson2&quot;.

This isn't a big deal on a desktop, but on an Android device out can be tedious to
typea list of tags in the &quot;regular&quot; search box.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1888 My cards have double questions and the answers of the cards have the double questions
and single answers, meaning if the question is &quot;gato&quot; and the answer is &quot;cat,&quot; the
front of the card shows:

gato
gato

and the back shows:

gato 
gato 
_____ (separator line)
cat

The first incidence of the question is in my chosen font and the second instance is
in something that looks like Times New Roman (serif font). The answer is back in my
chosen font. 

Is there something that I am doing to cause that? I looked at one of the cards in edit
view and didn't see anything unusual (no doubles there).

1. Add flash card with image with big resolution using pc.
2. open tail with this card. Open this flash card
3. display image..

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I see image fit to the screen. However the image is unreadeble because it is to small.
Of course I can rotate view to horizontal but the image is still to small. 
Good solution coluld be magnification feature when the card is displaying or option
&quot;show in real size&quot;. Please consider this because it will very usefull.

this is a very rare occurrence which I have only seen it happen with one card, though

been using it for about 6 months. I never saw this issue with any other cards.

Please provide any additional information below.
I want to put more of a description so it is clear what happened. I have a temporary
holding deck where I initially put cards when they're first made before they're checked
and finished. Then when I have time I go through those cards and finish them. When
they are finished I sort them into other decks. This is a process I have done about
a thousand times and it normally works without fail but I had one card that was stubborn
and misbehaved. I would open the card in question and change its deck and save the
card and when I looked in temporary holding deck the card was still there. If I opened
up the card it showed the right deck (not the holding deck), and it also appeared in
the correct deck when I looked into that deck, but it never left the temporarily holding
deck either. If I looked at the list view of the holding deck the card was still there
even if I hit the magnifying glass liking short notion to refresh the view. I finally
processed all of the other cards out of the temporary holding deck and the only hard
that remained was the problematic one. At this point I decided to go ahead and delete
the temporary deck even though it's still held the problematic card, to see what would
happen. Because the problematic card was also appearing in the correct deck I assumed
it may remain there after deleting the holding back. However, after deleting the holding
back the card in question was gone even from the correct deck.
I often use the check database feature just as good preventative maintenance, and I
did it many times while this problem was on going, but it did not fix the issue of
the card which did not want to change it's deck.
normally what would happen is I would finish a card, change its deck, save it which
would return me back to the list view of the temporary holding deck and then I would
hit the magnifying glass sort button to refresh the list view and the card I had just
edited would disappear out of the list of cards in the temporary holding file as it
should. The card in question would not. It would remain in the list view of the holding
deck even though it showed that it did not belong in that deck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1892 Hello,

I'm a developer of the Acapela TTS Engine for Android.
Some users reported that Ankidroid didn't work with our TTS.

So I did a look in the code and the main problem is that AnkiDroid doesn't wait that
TTS is well initialised (TTS init is async) before trying to read a card.
We did some improvement to speed up this but AnkiDroid really needs to wait TTS is
initialised before trying to speak a card.

I did some code modification on Anki-Android-2.0.1 source code.

I cannot attach it here (quota exceeded) but please send me a mail or reply here and
I will send it to you.
Maybe this is not the right way to do it but this might help.

Modification made on ReadText.java et Reviewer.java

Regards,

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1895 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Setting / view
2. Set don't for card overview
3. Search field ignores it

Or rooted device;
1. use ifont and/or font installer to set system font. 
2. Go to card overview 
3. Search field ignores it

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Search field should react and show Unicode font. But still can't show ancient greek
characters. Only rectangles instead.
Font change works everywhere else, lust  isshown correctly.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Everytime

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
2.0.1

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.2.2, device: Samsung galaxy s4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
All other field work with new font.

The custom font is properly displayed in the PC client. In android 4.2 and 4.3, I put
the custom font file in sdcard\Ankidroid\font folder and it was displayed properly.
After upgraded to android 4.4, the custom font then cannot be displayed. The problem
still continues after I reinstall Ankidroid

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1899 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck.
2. Select Show Answer.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the answer to show immediately (no flash to white).
Notice that the flashcard goes white for 0.5-1 seconds.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every time. And also when marking a card Hard/Good/Easy/Again.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? v2.0.1
On what version of Android? 4.4

Note that I just updated my device (an original Nexus 7) today, and didn't experience
any noticeable lag earlier. I find it a bit jarring now. For what its worth, this even
happens on small decks (about ~50 notes).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1900 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Have a mp3 media attached to a card and placed in collection.media/french folder.
Mind the french sub-folder
2. Properly reference the media like requis[sound:french/A_1385550931.79899149.mp3]
3. AnkiDroid2.0.1 is not playing the mp3 media (Android 4.4 KitKat on a Nexus 7)


Anki desktop is playing properly the same. I suspect the problem is with the french
sub-folder

It is happening all the time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1901 There is another good algorithm besides of Leitners one:
when reviewing cards, those which were answered wrong - to put them in the middle of
the deck. So the complicated cards will be reviewed more frequently during the cycle.

For example, cards: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Cards 4,7 and 11 are answered wrong, then
the cycle will be:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,4(inserted for 10/2=5 places forward), 9,10,11,7(inserted),1,2,3,4,5,11(inserted),6,7,8,9,...

I didn't see this feature before in any tool.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1902 I have been using Anki for a long time but recently when rebuilding filtered decks from
main decks, the cards I have already reviewed will come up as new cards. When I look
at them in the browser though they will have an interval and not appear as new cards.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. rebuild a filtered deck
2. already revised cards act as if new.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
expected output is for the already seen cards, when reviewed again to have good, easy
and hard, instead of just the 1min,10min,3days outlook that new cards have. instead
of the last &quot;3day easy&quot; mode, it will be the interview for the card that can be seen
in the browser.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
yes, but everyday the number of new cards and cards which appear reviewed changes (for
the same cards)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1903 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create new Type called V1.0(I use french version: Types de notes)
2. Add some cards with the new Type and with the default Type
3. Create a filter on Windows version -&gt;note:&quot;V1.0&quot;
4. Synchronize
5. From Ankidroid, synchronize
6. Study and synchronize multiple times (3 or 4)
7. On Ankidroid, the number of cards is 0 after the synchronization

To solve this issue, you have to come back to Windows version and click on the button
&quot;Rebuild&quot; (Reconstruire in FR) in the filter. 

I reproduce this bug more than 20 times

Version of Windows : 2.0.18
Version of Ankidroid : 2.0.1

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1904 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card in Anki Desktop using Image Occlusion 2.0
2. Open the card in AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
*I should see that the image is placed at the Center of the screen on my mobile device
without white spaces on the sides (I already managed to make the white space on top
and bottom disappear with adding the line you recommended on this forum: vertical-align:
baseline;)
I want to do the same with the sides, because like this it comes out so small on my
android (I am trying to make flash cards with labels for my med school and I only found
Image Occlusion- is there a different way?)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
every time


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.0.3

My main questions are
1. how to delete the extra white space on the sides that i see on myp phone?
2. is there a better way to create cards with labels? this comes out so ugly.. or maybe
you have a guide for this i can watch?
3. at the end of each study session i want to review it again for a few times but it
doesn't let me- it says I am all done for today, and then I need to press I want to
review it for the next day ahead of my time.. I don't like all this daying thing- how
can I just cancel the dissappearance of cards so it just lets me see all the cards
in the deck all the time?

Looking forward for you answers! :)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1905 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Since I can't seem to find a way to reset the values, trying to reproduce the error
is out of my reach, but it occurred after having reviews opened and leaving the phone
idle for quite some time.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is obviously positive and within reasonable reach, what I get instead
are huge negative numbers, pretty much alike to the problems of signed/unsigned number
conversion.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
As stated above, it happened once, but the estimates are staying this way for some
days now, probably because old data needs more time to be discarded, if it is discarded
at all for this purpose.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1906 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Try to delete an empty deck from the Decks screen.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the deck to be deleted with no confirmation, just as is done on Anki desktop
client. Instead, I get the message &quot;Are you sure you wish to delete all cards in 'someDeck'&quot;.
This is disturbing as the user feels that he is loosing data when in reality, the deck
is empty.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes, every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1907 What steps will reproduce the problem?
I do not know an assured way to reproduce the problem. It happens to me after some
continued practice. (Maybe after half an hour of practicing.) And it started when switching
to Android 4.4 (KitKat):
After some time of practicing the content of the second side of the card does not get
shown. I just get the buttons. Even if I wait some seconds nothing happens anymore.
When I hit the back button, I can go back in the application. But as soon as I try
to get forward again or I reopen the application, I get the message, that the application
crashed. Asking me whether I want to send a bug report. (I confirmed this several times,
by the way, so you should have stack traces.)
Problem is there on my new Nexus 5 from the beginning (Android 4.4(.1)). On my Nexus
7 2012 WiFi it started after the upgrade from Android 4.3 to 4.4.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I'd expect to just continue practicing. I.e. seeing the next card or its backside.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens again an again. But it is not reproducable, as it does not happen at the
beginning. Just after you continue some practicing.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1908 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Install Ankidroid on a phone with very high display resolution (e.g. Nexus 5 has 480
dpi). Open some of the staticis. All text in these graphics is that small, that you
cannot read it.
It seems to me, that the font size in this graphics is selected by physical pixel dimensions
instead of the dimensions in density independant pixels (dip).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I'd expect the application to select larger fonts (measured in real pixel size) on
displays with higher resolution. Specifying the font size in dip (the Android unit
for sizes) should fix this automatically because a dip in display density independent.
On displays with a higher DPI number, the same dip size automatically selects a bigger
font.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
The problem always exists when the application is used on the Nexus 5.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using?

This happens every time, and I can reproduce it with 100% consistency. It works just
fine on the Desktop, but not with v2.0.1 on Android.

This is useful when learning long texts where you blot out some words (in one text
field using clozes), but having the entire line in another field (blocked out by a
second cloze). This is also the recommended way by the manual to build these kinds
of cards.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1912 Please explain your idea here.
Android devices have limited space. 
I do not want every deck on my phone all the time. 
I do not want to permanently delete my decks.
How can I keep my &quot;Master decks&quot; on my computer, and only have what I'm studying NOW
on my phone?

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1913 What steps will reproduce the problem?
I can't reproduce the problem. AnkiDroid will sporadically fail during card reading.
Usually it is after a certain number of cards read.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I see a white screen instead of the back side of the card. Then AnkiDroid stops and
I have sent several bug reports.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It has happened to me repeatedly over the course of several days. I sent numerous bug
reports via the AnkiDroid bug reports system and via Andriod OS.



What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
2.0.1

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)


It would help if Ankidroid would write more often to the database file or automatically
sync to the server. Then I would not loose my progress.

With the v2.0.2 update it appears the vertical text alignment has been changed to always
appear on top. This feels very unnatural and even somewhat physically uncomfortable
to me, especially in portrait mode. I would like to have an option available in the
Display menu to re-center the text like it was in the previous version.

The sound playback image has a style rule that sets the outer span as display:inline-block;.
This inlines the span and it ends up below card content, making it untappable.

It manifests in this manner on Android 2.3, but the style rule is wrong nevertheless
(it applied to the older table layout which we don't use anymore).

AnkiDroid updated. Then right after the update, the fonts are not working anymore...

Ankidroid shouldn't crash, even less make my device to reset itself...

Happened to me at least 4 times, it seems like some serious memory leak or something.

I always send my crash logs, and it seems this may be known, but didn't see the issue
listed here (although I may have missed it).

Can I rollback to the previous version? that one was working fine...

Thank you.

1. Add LaTex code to a template separating lines using the enter key i.e. use more
than one line
2. Sync, view in AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It is expected the LaTex code will be rendered properly (or it will show a picture
rendered with the desktop cliet).  However, what you see is the LaTex code e.g. [latex]\begin{align*}
etc.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1939 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1.Using Ankidroid on a Samsung Galaxy 4 phone.
Phone is Samsung Galaxy SC-04E
Operating System is Android 4.2.2
Ankidroid is version 2.0.2

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
On previous versions of Android it is possible to use the standard two finger stretch
function to increase the size of a display.  This works for other applications such
as the picture gallery but not for Ankidroid.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens every time.

Given the function works for other applications it is not a complete operating system
failure but seems to be something about the way Ankidroid is working with the operating
system.

Android 4.2.2 has a separate feature which increases or decreases the display size
when the screen is tapped three times rapidly.  This does work with Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1941 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review a card as &quot;Again&quot;, which correctly changes its rating to 1 (&quot;Relearn&quot;).
2. Bury this card the next time it comes up.

Expected Outcome:
Card keeps the same due date and shows up again the next time the deck is opened.

Actual Outcome:
Card is rescheduled as if it had been marked as correct. (Though the rating remains
the same.)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? 
This happens every time.

The same problem used to occur when the card to be relearned was part of a custom deck
and that deck was rebuilt but I haven't checked that for a while.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
2.0.2

On what version of Android?
2.3.7 (Custom ROM)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1942 Thanks a lot for the latest version of AnkiDroid (2.0) which contains a lot of great
improvements and bug fixes.

But the display of the question (and answer) content, which used to be centered vertically,
is now at the top of the screen. I'm not sure whether that was intentional or the result
of another change. But it is clearly more distracting for the user as the question
is now close to the details at the top of the AnkiDroid screen and close to the status
bar for many Android devices.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1943 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start reviewing cards which have to type in correct answer.
2. Whether or not I have written anything, after clicking &quot;Show answer&quot;,
3. Anki tries to &quot;Open collection&quot; and stays in this state.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It should compare the typed in with the correct answer and show me if mine is right
or wrong. Instead it remains in the state of opening collection for infinite time.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Almost every time. But if I didn't type anything and also didn't open the keyboard,
there is a high percentage that this issue doesn't occur.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
AnkiDroid v2.0.2
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Android 4.2.2


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1944 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Place 1K_vocab.apkg, Ultimate_Geography_Countries_Capitals_Flags__Oceans.apkg, and
deutsch_-_russisch__-__A1_.apkg into /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/
2. Open AnkiDroid, select More-&gt;Import cards-&gt;OK-&gt;1K_vocab, wait for import to finish.
3. Select More-&gt;Import cards-&gt;OK again, but now choose, for example, &quot;deutsch_-_russisch__-__A1_&quot;.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: &quot;Whould you like to add the content of file /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/deutsch_-_russisch__-__A1_.apkg
to your collection or replace your collection with it?&quot;
Actual: &quot;Whould you like to add the content of file /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroii/1K_vocab.apkg
to your collection or replace your collection with it?&quot;

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes. The question still mentions &quot;1K_vocab&quot; even though I already deleted it from AnkiDroid
directory.
After restaring AnkiDroid I also got &quot;Whould you like to add the content of file null
to your ...&quot;. The actual import is working and uses the correct file.

1. Open AnkiDroid
2. Select Get shared decks
3. Try clicking though and installing something

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected: it is successfull or shows some clear error message
Actual: if keeps on &quot;Loading available shared decks&quot; indefinitely, shows just white
screen or fails to react to clicking on links or &quot;Info&quot; button sporatically.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens most times (usually prevents from successfully installing a deck). Hovewer
after rebooting the device and immediately starting AnkiDroid it worked well once.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1947 Here's what I did:

1. uploaded the AnkiDroid collection file, media, and backups folders to my laptop
desktop with AirDroid.  Uploaded material is correct with the correct dates and times.

2. opened the collection file collection.anki2 with desktop anki, by double-clicking
the file, or right-clicking and choosing &quot;open with anki&quot;.

The file does open, but the number of due cards is not correct, and the two decks I
imported from the public website do not appear.  However, the media files from the
newly imported decks are present in the media folder, and the collection.anki2 file
has the correct date and time.

anki Version 2.0.20 Qt 4.7.0 PyQt 4.7.3

AnkiDroid v2.0.2

Ultimately I want to edit my AnkiDroid collection with desktop anki.  However, syncing
with the server does not work .... the sync begins normally, but aborts after about
a half hour and about 30 MB are sent to the server with the message &quot;sync error&quot;. 


Any suggestions?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1948 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Reviewing my flashcards on ankidroid - at random, the number of cards left halves
- all &quot;new cards&quot; dissapear.

2. I try to sync to get the &quot;correct&quot; review queue back, and one of two things happen.
1: deck syncs without any change (the faulty queue is unchanged) or 2: anki speaks
of a syncing conflict and asks me to chose between local source or anki-web. I choose
local in order to keep the status of the cards i just reviewed. When i sync from local,
the correct review queue reappears. Until the problem repats itself - seamingly without
reason.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the queue to change normally - instead, a significant part of the cards dissapear
at random.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It has happened repeatedly, however, when syncing, the problem isn't always resolved
(as descibed above)

1. Go to preferences.
2. Choose category 'Language'.
3. Click Language to select app language and select either flavor of Spanish or either

4. Hit the back button until AnkiDroid closes. 
5. Restart Anki and notice it is still in English (or system default)

I would expect to see foreign text in most places, and that is what I see for French,
Swedish, Italian, etc.

Every time. I do not know how many other languages it may affect besides the 4 options

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1952 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Was using Linux Mint 13 64 bit, audio on Anki worked fine.
2. Switched to Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, restalled Anki, synced with Ankiweb, downloaded
decks from Ankiweb
3. Created new cards with audio. New audio works on Anki desktop. The audio files appear
on Ankiweb and Ankidroid, but never play.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect all audio files to play on all Anki platforms. Currently the old audio is
playing on all platforms. New audio only plays on Anki desktop.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1954 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enter a text with unicode soft hyphen characters in a flashcard, e.g.:
Antidisestablishmentarianism­Antidisestablishmentarianism­Antidisestablishmentarianism
2. Open the flashcard in Ankidroid.

The expected output would only show the hyphens when an actual break is needed (seems
to work on the desktop version), while in Ankidroid, all softhyphens are shown as hyphens.
This happens reproducably

I usually copy context phrases out of hyphenated ebooks on Kindle, so the text contains
softhyphens, which are not displayed on the desktop versions. I don’t care much for
the hyphenation, just hiding them would be ok.

AnkiDroid could import definitions into a special &quot;Google Translate Phrasebook&quot; deck,

:

I'm seeing frequent instances of AnkiDroid posting a successful call to applyChunk
and then failing to finish the sync:

2013-10-11 23:23:38,346 568     200 OK  finish: /sync/start
2013-10-11 23:23:41,967 072     200 OK  finish: /sync/applyChanges
2013-10-11 23:23:45,786 080     200 OK  finish: /sync/chunk
2013-10-11 23:24:04,349 070     200 OK  finish: /sync/applyChunk
2013-10-11 23:26:21,774 896     
    (another sync started)

This causes problems because the existing sync is still running. The above session
key fix will at least prevent conflicts, but it will mean users have to wait a few
minutes until their previous sync times out. I tried to look up related errors on the
triage tool, but it's giving internal server errors for any operation performed on
v2.0.1. At a guess, perhaps something in sanityCheck() is firing a runtime exception.
It would be great if it could catch any exceptions and post null to AnkiWeb, as that
way the server is able to clean up the sync.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1959 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use this deck https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2743658753
2. Open on PC, you will see 〜 character in many cards
3. Open on AnkiDroid, the 〜 character does not display.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect to see the 〜 character on the cards that have it. I see a blank space instead.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time, the 〜 character never displays

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1960 Hello! Thanks for your program :)!

Is there a possibility to add a &quot;real&quot; fullscreen option and remove buttons and progress
bar (not only menubar)?
I use only gestures with Ankidroid and I never use buttons. Also I don't use progress
indicators, drawing board etc. But there is no option to hide this excess functionality
from interface.

This control elements can occupy up to 30% of the screen on small smartphones. They
are always distract me. And the problem is even more severe in landscape mode. This
redundante controls eats up to 50% of screen. And when I trying to look at some images
(chemical formulas, etc), I saw only half part of the images (very annoing).
Maybe it is possible to reduse this controls in size, somehow?

I'm not a programmer, but I'll be very glad to help for Anki/Ankidroid project in any
other way. Sorry for my English.
Thank you!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1965 There are cases where a user sets his phone to silent because he's in an enviroment
in which he would disturb other people through audio.

In that case AnkiDroid currently still gives the user cards that contain audio information
but doesn't play that information.

I therefore suggest that when the device media loudness is that to zero, Anki simply
skips all cards that contain audio information.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1972 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Syncing a deleted deck between droid/ankiweb.
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I want to sync from my droid, but it just syncs from AnkiWeb.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
KitKat

Please provide any additional information below.
I use AD on two different droids: a nexus 7 and a moto x. I was getting frustrated
with one of my decks messing up constantly on the nexus 7, so I deleted it and synced,
thinking it would just re-download the deck. As you can probably guess, it instead
synced in the opposite direction, deleting the deck from AnkiWeb as well. I tried to
go to my desktop version of Anki and change a few things on that end before syncing
(answered a few flashcards). I was hoping that the system would see the difference
and ask which version I wanted to keep, Anki's or Ankiweb's. Instead, it just synced
FROM Ankiweb this time, which means the deck is now gone from my desktop version as
well.

Therefore, the only proper version of the deck is saved on my Moto X. I don't know
how to get the data back onto AnkiWeb. I tried syncing, but it just started downloading
data rather than uploading, meaning it was just syncing from AnkiWeb (and deleting
the deck from the last device that has it). I tried restoring from a backup on my desktop
computer, but it doesn't save my progress. Instead, it makes me start from zero, with
none of my flashcards' progress saved (i.e. they're all new now, rather than most of
them being mature).

I also tried the process laid out here (https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/wiki/FAQ)
under the heading &quot;How can I copy cards from AnkiDroid to my PC without using sync?&quot;
but that didn't work. It only tells me that anki2 files are not designed for importing.

Is there any way to fix this, or am I out of luck?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1979 I was thinking that it would really improve the efficiency of the app if there were
more entertaining methods of study. For example, if crossword puzzles were made out
of random cards in users' decks, that would greatly enhance their studying experience.
Other games/activities such as word matching etc.. could also be incorporated to improve
the app.

Thanks for your consideration

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1982 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.sync
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I got a stack of cards with images in it, they are shown on the pc version, but not
on the android mobile version. Media sync is activated. I can only see a little sign
with a question mark in it.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
problem exists every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
mobile: v2.0.3
pc: v2.0.21

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1983 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Make a large deck, i.e. 1000+ cards in the deck
2. Put a hyperlink on the back of each card, i.e., a custom link that leads to direct
look up of the word in an online dictionary
3. Export this deck from your Anki desktop, copy apkg to phone's Ankidroid folder,
and import
4. Import stops at or during &quot;Import of cards&quot;

I'm not sure if it is the hyperlinks causing this, or if Ankidroid has a limit placed
on the total number of cards/decks on the phone? If the latter, what is the limit?

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Successful import of cards. Instead I get crashing during &quot;Import of cards&quot;.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

90% of the time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

I tried using SendLog but it stated it had no permission to create logs. I also wasn't
sure which format to choose.


Please provide any additional information below.

These are the two bug reports I found for my phone on your bug report site. The same
errors have been preventing ankidroid studying for the last two months:

http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_bug?bug_id=2583422
http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_bug?bug_id=6745576985067520

I would immensely appreciate it if someone could help me get to the bottom of this!

Thank you!

I also previously posted my issue under a similar issue: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=1694

Not sure if that was the correct way, so am trying this now!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1986 
When I play an mp3 file associated to the answer of a card with Ankidroid, by clicking
the play button, the one or two last syllables are missing. When I play the same mp3
file with Anki on my computer, the mp3 file is complete.
Ankidroid seems to cut the sound too fast.
It doesn't happen when the mp3 file has a few seconds of silence after the last word.
But mp3 files generated but Awesome TTS (for example) stop just after the last word,
so I can't hear the last syllables with Ankidroid.


I'm using Akidroid v.2.0.3 and Android 2.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1987 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Activate sync operation
2. Make some changes (i.e. review the cards) and sync again.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
At the end of the first sync it displays the message:
java.io.IOException: open failed: EINVAL (Invalid argument)

The syncronization at this stage seems to be correct, but after the review of one of
the decks (not always) trying to syncronize again ends with the error:
Syncing error, type 409, message: Conflict

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time the first error, often the second error.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1988 We currently have options &quot;Collapse Deck&quot; and &quot;Inflate Deck&quot;, for hiding and showing
any subdecks, respectively. These options are available by long tapping on a deck.

Considering even Nicolas wasn't clear on what these do (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-android/Mkfqn1SS4NU),
I suggest the following changes:

1) Change the strings to the simpler &quot;Hide Subdecks&quot; and &quot;Show Subdecks&quot;
2) Only show &quot;Show Subdecks&quot; on decks which actually have subdecks

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1989 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. start lesson
2. do about 30 cards
3. stop
4. start again and after abotu 10 to 20 cards app will stop.

I can only see last card without any reaction for using buttons. Then app will stop.
Moreover my network connection is also stopped then getting back after a minute or
so. 

This problem occures every time I try to use AnkiDroid.
AnkiDroid v2.0.4.
Android 4.2.1.

Unfortunately I can't use SendLog because my phone which is GoClever Insignia 5, it
doesn't have root acces. I sent report from aplication instead.

See the attatched file.
My statistics have been messed up during the last 6 months - What i am thinking is
that this is exacly the time when ankidroid 2 was released.

Scroll down to see &quot;anmeldelsestid&quot; which is the acumulated time of reviews since i
started using anki two years ago. Some results come up negative and are useless  -
you kan see it reflected on the graph, when the light green line dumps.

I wish i were able to use my statistics from the whole period, but i fear that it might
be corrupted and the the correct number at some point was erased from the database.


Which other info's could be helpful?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1995 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Normal reviewing
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the card to show up normally - A text, with one cloze marked out in blue.
When i click the answer button i am suppose to get the answer to the cloze as well
as a soundfile played.

What i get is an empty sceen as if the card had no text in it - when i click the answer
button, i still get no text, but, the sound is still played.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This is not completely consistent. A card can start doing this after having worked
perfectly fine for a while, and without me modyfing anything. I usually supend the
cards when this happen. Only solution seems to be to delete the card and start anew.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1996 hi there.at first i want to thanks for your great app.
i was wondering if there is any way to have the notes which we write on the screen,using
the whiteboard tool or any other one,to be saved on the cards as a part of them ,like
when you are reading an example sentence in the answer and you wanna draw a circle
around a specific word or write a note in a specific field or on the card itself ,instead
of typing it.in fact the very unique ability that a paper flashcard gives you is that
you can write your own notes on it,which is a very useful way to better memorizing.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.
 i don't think so.

thanks a lot again!

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2001 What steps will reproduce the problem?
(unfortunately, this is hard to reproduce. Something odd must be going on in the background)
1. Turn off 'automatically display answer'
2. Open a deck
3. Wait an unspecified length of time (sometime 5min, sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes
never happens!), and Anki will skip from Card1 to Card2. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
&gt; This occurs regardless of whether you are on the front or the back of Card1. It also
occurs regardless of whether the phone is active or asleep.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
&gt;This has happened to me over 100 times. However, I still cannot consistently reproduce
it! I am at a loss

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2007 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck for reviewing, that has TTS preferences for the back side of the cards.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect the first card due for the day to show. Instead a message appears &quot;Init TTS&quot;
for 1 second, and the first review card is skipped past. When you get to the end of
the deck, the &quot;Congratulations, you've finished&quot; screen appears, even though that first
review card is still due.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Even if you go into the deck again to try and review that last card left to be reviewed,
the &quot;Init TTS&quot; appears, and the review card is skipped past, so you see the &quot;Congratulations,
you've finished&quot; screen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2014 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Syncing sometimes causes it, if I haven't exited the program before (just minimise
it) and try to sync sometimes that causes it
2. It will randomly crash and after that sometimes that causes it
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect it to sync properly but it crashes then when I open it again it has a message
saying there is a major update to anki which I need to install even though I have the
latest version already. I tried everything like not choosing not to upgrade trying
to go back to the old deck, trying to install back ups (it says they are not valid
apk files) then I always end up with no decks left and I have to sync with the deck
online and so lose my progress.
Or sometimes I just open it and the same message is displayed (I think that may be
after crashing but I don't remember as the last one was a couple of weeks ago)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens sometimes.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) v2.0.4
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) 2.3.5


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
I now have send log so I'll send it the next time it happens

The method selectAndCopyText() from Reviewer.java is broken in Jelly Bean... I don't
know how to fix it, and couldn't find anything on the net except for this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7581131/how-to-enable-the-default-highlight-menus-in-android-webview)

But do we really need to have a menu item for this? Does long-tapping on the text and
selecting copy work on all Android versions? If so, instead of having that menu entry
double as &quot;select text&quot;/&quot;lookup in x dictionary&quot; , we could just remove the select
text functionality entirely.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2021 Suggestion to create an intent to call synchronization externally
That is great to use with automation tools (tasker, llama)

Suggestion of Parameters:

Parameter: conflictResolution
Description: How resolve conflict situations. Use other than cancel at your own risk!
Options: 
 - cancel (default, cancel the sync if conflited), 
 - forceDeviceData (override server data with device data),
 - forceServerData (override device data with server data)

Parameter: preventOverloadDelay
Description:
A suggestion to prevent multiple calls to this intent. Buggy automation tasks can overload
anki server, this parameter tries to reduce this issue.
Maybe ankidroid can save last sync date. On intent call, it compares with this parameter:
If actual sync date is earlier than (last sync date + overloadDelay), don't sync
Options: integer value representing minutes (default 10 minutes)

1. Open AnkiDroid
2. Press on the Sync button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The sync (in this case, download of data from Anki computer) process doesn't complete
- it starts up and stays on 
'Preparing syncing... Up:0 kb, Down: 0kb' for quite a while (~30 seconds)
before a 
'Sync log: An error has occurred. Please try again later.' message appears.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes, every time.

AnkiDroid - version 2.0.4

I've only been using AnkiDroid for a week (but the computer Anki for a year or so),
synced ~70mb over from the computer the first time and uploaded a few times from the
phone without any problems. Made a new deck and 70 or so cards today and wanted to
sync them on to the phone.

I thought the problem might be caused by a lack of storage space or by a poor connection,
so I deleted 1gb or so of media, and went into a good coverage spot, but no luck, so
it seems these aren't the problems.

Thank you for any forthcoming help.

Firstly thanks for your app, it is very helpful and I cannot imagine a day without
it!

Could you please add the button &quot;Clear Whiteboard&quot; while reviewing cards? In present,
&quot;Clear Whiteboard&quot; is in a list, and it is very inconvenient to do two taps (open the
list - clear whiteboard) each time. 

Clearly it is usability issue.

Thanks in advance

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2024 What steps will reproduce the problem?
The following steps likely require a source deck with certain properties, namely a
fair amount of new along with some due for review cards.
1. Create a filter deck from some deck, using default values. You want the resulting
cram deck to either be all review cards, or at least have some review and some new.
2. Without reviewing a single card, go delete the cram deck (which may crash due to
issue 2009, which has been addressed and will not be the cause of this issue)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until eventually you have only new cards in the cram deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expect the exact same deck to be generated each time, with no changes. Instead,
it is either handing me new cards (I don't know), or upon deleting the cram/filter
deck it is changing the scheduling or some other property of the cards such that they
appear new rather than as reviews. Perhaps, it marks cards as &quot;seen&quot;, such that the
default critera of oldest not seen is selecting a new set of cards, but, the cards
have not actually been seen! So this would not be a proper result.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I don't know and haven't tried.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

I was on a dev version, after the v2.1beta6 bump, specifically at commit 482ee8fb7afbbc...
in git.

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.1.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2025 Anki Desktop has a check media function, which first shows a list of unused media, and
then deletes the unused files if the user desires.

We have a method which deletes all unused media:
col.getMedia().removeUnusedImages();

Before AnkiDroid 2.1, it was previously called every time a deck was deleted, but as
per issue 2009 this was inconsistent with Anki Desktop and removed.

Change the &quot;(+)&quot; text currently shown in the deck picker for indicating existence of
subdecks to a clickable button which performs expand (i.e. &quot;show subdecks&quot;) operation,
exactly like in Anki Desktop.

The onItemClickListener for the adapterview class which shows the deck list doesn't
provide the horizontal position where the user tapped, so presumably an actual button
would have to be added to each row, which seems like quite a lot of work.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2032 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set the mentioned option to Use current deck
2. Enter a new word, the offered deck will not be the current, but some other
3. Manually choosing the current deck will suffice only for that word alone. Try entering
another word, again some other deck will be selected as the destination deck. In my
case it's always some other deck that I don't use so often. 

This option was working well until a couple of updates ago, then started happening.
I didn't write down exactly when. 

It happens this way every time now. I tried wiping cache, but nothing changed. 

Running always the latest beta (don't hold me for the word, but I think it started
with beta 7. Latest stock Kit Kat 4.4.2 on N5, with Xposed and GravityBox modifications.


Thanks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2033 Just using the shared deck for &quot;ASL Browser&quot; you can see that the mp4 videos are not
displayed.  I was wondering if anyone had submitted this previously or if anyone had
looked into it.  I played around a bit with the code and got them sorta displaying
out of playSound() with a bit of ugly hacking.  Getting them to look nice would involve
adding a VideoView to the layout and passing the Activity into playSound() as an argument
since playSound() lives in libanki.  A library of shared routines we presume.  That
change would ripple through a number of files in the project.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2037 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Turn on night mode
2. Start learning
3. Go to next flashcard

What is the expected output? 
No flicker.

What do you see instead?
Before displaying next card, black background turns into white for fraction of the
second causing screen flicker (see movie below)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every time, but only on Xperia Tipo.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
It occurs on versions greater than 2.0.1
On v2.0.1 everything is ok.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2038 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set your AnkiDroid to night mode
2. Review a card, and attempt to edit that card
3. In the editor, hit preview, and see a blank card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The text should show up in white against the black background. Instead the card looks
or is blank.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Every time.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,

AnkiDroid disables &quot;reschedule my answers&quot; whereas Desktop enables it.

Let's try to be consistent with Desktop as much as possible.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2045 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start Ankidroid
2. Chose a deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Instead of showing the card, Ankidroid shows a message: &quot;Init TTS&quot;. The message doesn't
disappear. Pressing the &quot;back&quot;-Button makes the message disappear and shows an empty
card. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens on every deck, always.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
AnkiDroid v.2.1.1
Android 4.3.1


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
Before I updated to this version, TTS worked only sometimes, but cards and decks were
shown without problems.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2051 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.I'm working in a specific deck (ex: Deck N1) and suddenly want to add a note but
for another deck. I change the Note Deck field name to Deck N2 and add my word.
2. Once I added my word, the Note Deck Field is still on Deck N2

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
As I'm still working &quot;under&quot; the deck N1, I expect the Note Deck Field to automatically
select again what should be the default Deck Name (ie ; the current Deck Name). Instead,
after adding my word using a different Deck Name, The field for the next new note still
use this Deck Name. But 99% chances that the next word will be added under the Current
Deck Name.
This was working well in the previous version.

Yes, everytime.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2054 What steps will reproduce the problem?

- Import a shared deck which has the same name as a local deck.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

- The shared and the local decks get mixed up somehow. The app flags the deck as imported
shared deck but it still shows the local decks cards. It might simply add the shared
decks cards, I'm not sure about that.
Expected behaviour would be to show a warning that the deck name is already in use
and ask for a different deck name to use for the import.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

- Happens all the time. I tried it with the shared deck &quot;BWI&quot;. My local BWI deck has
lots of sub decks but that's probably not relevant.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2055 I loved the 1x1 widget in the past, but I just bought a new phone and now there is only
the 2x2 widget which takes up too much space and looks distorted on my phone.

I've been trying to search for documentation stating why you changed to the 2x2 widget
and removed the 1x1, but haven't found anything.

If it's not too much to ask, could you please put the 1x1 widget back, or create a
widget that can have the size adjusted? You don't have to remove the 2x2, if people
prefer that, they can still use it, but please also include the 1x1 widget.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who preferred the 1x1 widget.

Love the app and appreciate all your efforts to keep it current.
Thank you.

I would love it if it were possible to automatically add images to your cards based

sides and &quot;apple&quot; is on the front with &quot;Apfel&quot; on the back side, the feature could
select the image file with the title &quot;apple&quot; from a specified folder of images, and
so on, for all of the cards in the deck.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

Not to my knowledge.

Thanks! :-)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2060 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Do daily new cards/reviews on Ankidroid.
2.Don't sync windows Anki for a few days.
3.Add/modify cards in windows Anki. 
4.Sync windows Anki.
5.Sync Ankidroid.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output is that card modifications/new cards made on desktop anki will be accepted
by ankidroid without losing ankidroid review/new card progress. 

Instead, new cards/modifications were updated on ankidroid, but all ankidroid progress
was lost at the same time.(See image)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This has happened a few times.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
v2.0beta23
android version:2.3.3


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
On the enclosed image, you can see the 21 cards(3 days worth, 871-891) that were overwritten.
Curiously, the new cards done earlier in the day were not overwritten.

We can override this behavior as described at the beginning of this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7765336/226958

We could just move the file to the backup folder.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2062 Since Android 4.1, Android apps can not only see their own log.
Apps like LogCollector don't work anymore.
It becomes very difficult to debug user problems.

A solution could be to implement a mini LogCollector inside AnkiDroid, which would
allow users to send their log.
Should it POST to a server, or send an email, or a copy/paste?
I think data should only be visible by a few developers, not public.

Feedback welcome!

This allows for more expressivity than plain text, for instance boxes and arrows are
quickly drawn.
Even for pure text this might be faster than typing, depending on device.

Any proof-of-concept of how this could work/look are welcome.

- Ankidroid 2.1 added a preview button in editing mode. This button is set on top of
the fields with the texts and moves these fields for editing down. If there is a lot
of texts in the fields they might be moved so much down that one or more fields may
get covered by the keyboard. I think that the preview button is rarely used that why
it should be move down, at the bottom or at least below the save/close buttons which
are used much more often.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2067 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. From deck picker, long tap on a deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- The options menu appears (with show subdecks/rename/delete), but as soon as the tap
is released, the deck is then selected, showing the study options, and preventing an
option from the context menu from being selected.
- However, the menu is still accessible by clicking the back button to go back to the
deck picker.
- Ideally, the screen would not go to the study options, but instead, stay on the deck
context menu.

- I experience the error on AnkiDroid 2.1.2 on Android 4.4.2 (Nexus 5). The problem
continued even after uninstalling/reinstalling.
- However, the problem does not occur on AnkiDroid 2.1.2 on Android 4.2.2 or 4.0.4.

- Not a force close issue

Please provide any additional information below.

- I'm guessing that for whatever reason, both mDeckSelHandler and mContextMenuListener
are being called in DeckPicker.java.
- Thank you very much for looking into this, and I appreciate all the work that has
gone into this!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2074 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install Application on Galaxy Note 3
2. Open Application
3. Wait a couple of hours then entire OS starts to Lag, with CPU Maxed out

Tested with on/off days for around 15 days. Issue occurs on the 7 days that AnkiDroid
was installed, and issues not seen whilst uninstalled on the remaining 8 days. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This is repeatable, however, It seems to take some time for the CPU usage to kick in.
And since the offending issue is running within the System UI process, its hard to
say its definitely caused by Anki, other then the correlation strongly suggesting it.


This is Android KitKat, on Galaxy note 3. 


Whilst I'm not looking for a solution here, or for anyone to start looking into, Mostly
wondering if anyone else has seen the issue or knows anything. 

Since Im an Android developer, I'd quite like to get to the bottom of this myself,
and will keep updates and findings here

As my phone is rather small, this effect is actually noticeable and wasting space that
is in short supply.

I have made a few screen shots. The red line is at the same height in all four of the
images. The button in the first one should be only as high as those in the second one.

Also, i think the idea behind this line:
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/807207601c60e8d6b60197844ca688113d79a520/src/com/ichi2/anki/Reviewer.java#L1751
was to avoid this issue. Either it is not working, or i don’t understand the code.
(The second option is quite likely.)

In version 2.0.4 Clear Whiteboard is not in overflow button. Clear Whiteboard is in
overflow button, other buttons takes to much space. This happens even when changing

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2079 When I downloaded some shared decks, a number of new tags appeared on the left side.
This makes sense because these cards use them. However, when I deleted the shared decks,
these tags remained. I tried to remove these tags by highlighting the tag and click
&quot;remove tags&quot; and selecting the tag I wanted to remove. This does not do anything.
I did a test by creating new tags by clicking &quot;add tags&quot;, but again I can't remove
the tags by clicking &quot;remove tags&quot;. Is this a bug or is there a way to remove those
tags from appearing on the left menu if I no longer use them?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2080 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review some cards 
2. Later, review other cards 
3. All cards are white. But when you edit them, you can see the content 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Instead of having the content
of the note, the card is blank. When I answer, I don't see the animation. It happen
with every type of cards I have. 


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? It is the first time for me and I solved it with reinstalling
the app, without uninstalling.

I don't think I have done something different than other times so I can't see anything
that can cause this bug.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2084 On my Galaxy S2 device running Android 4.1.2, calls like the following in the reviewer
only end up playing the answer, because the question is interrupted.

https://github.com/timrae/Anki-Android/blob/feature-replay-action/src/com/ichi2/anki/Reviewer.java#L2543

Sound.playSounds(MetaDB.LANGUAGES_QA_QUESTION);
Sound.playSounds(MetaDB.LANGUAGES_QA_ANSWER);

I think we might need to do the addSounds() work in playSounds() so that we add both
the question and answer when required, and then let Sound.playSounds() deal with the
cascading issue.

I am not sure whether the decks appear ordered by deck id, randomly, or something like
depth-first.

for windows! Please! Please! Please! or many idiots like me have to upload or download
the whole database very very often, because i always forget sync manually in ankidroid,
which makes the reviews data lost so frequently!


Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? 
Yes! available on Anki Desktop!

Is there any way I can edit the card info to remove the wrong info and actually review
those cards properly.  It has messed up the stats.

Please help.  I've googled and search to no avail.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2096 What steps will reproduce the problem?
creating a new fact in the deck. When I check the card type it shows me both cards
but it creates only the recall in my deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect two cards for my fact. I got 16 facts with both sides and after I created
them it's only one side now every time.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It worked before but it stopped and never worked again after that.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

Please provide any additional information below.

I tried adding cards on the desktop version as well, same result.
On android it even says that two cards were created but only one shown up in the list
and in the reviews.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2098 When a full sync is necessary, even the settings are overwritten so ankidroid takes
the settings from desktop Anki. That's unwanted as I only use Anki to create notes,
so even full syncs should not care about settings (there is no reason to sync settings
after a change that forces a full-sync like changing a note type).

Possibly related #680

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set &quot;next day starts at&quot; and &quot;learn ahead limit&quot; to something else then the default
on ankidroid (assuming both Apps used the default before).
2. Do a normal sync from ankidroid - the settings will not be synced.
3. Initiate a full sync from Anki - settings on ankidroid will be lost.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2099 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Every time I try to sync my Ankidroid with my Ankiweb I get an error when I try
to upload my decks from my phone which screen says &quot;Your database is corrupt. Please
fix it before trying again to sync. See 2131231612 for information about repairing
your database.&quot;

Additionally, when I have tried to download my Anki web onto my desktop (new computer
didn't install Anki yet) it won't sync with my web account. It keeps telling me that
my username or password is incorrect... despite the fact that I just used them to log
into Ankiweb.

I wasn't able to figure out which version of Ankidroid as I wasn't able to access the
menu options listed below. I am using a Samsong Galaxy 2 Version 4.1.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2100 I can not browse card after updating my version. It will just collapse and force close
the application. 
I had no problems with other versions at all!
The force close happens when I start browsing one of my decks

should be already selected as soon as the card is created, before filling in any info

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

Yes, this is how Anki desktop for the Mac behaves, I assume the other desktop versions
are the same.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2103 Now that there is a &quot;replay audio&quot; menu entry included in AnkiDroid v2.2, we might want
to consider a preference which removes the inline buttons for playing audio.

Such a setting exists in the iOS version, and also has the advantage of making the
cards display exactly like Anki Desktop.

Please star and/or comment on this issue if you would like to see this setting introduced
into a future version of AnkiDroid.

We could either implement it as a checkbox, or perhaps a multi-choice list, which allows
a bit more customization, such as promoting the replay audio menu entry to the action
bar.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2105 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Try adding a note of Front/Back type
2. Upon trying to save it you will be greeted with a pop up dialog window saying &quot;This
note shares its primary field with another note. Save anyway?&quot;
3. As far as I can tell it's caused by imperfection of Front/Back type of notes, which
means creating two notes so that the user could be asked both front and back side at
some point while learning.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I do not expect this message when creating Front/Back type note. I have to dismiss
it every time I create a note

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

This one on v2.2alpha is too dark.

color used in v2.1.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2107 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use a new 2.2alpha version, e.g. 2.2alpha56
2. Use German or, presumably, some other language
3. Go to the deck browser
4. Select the „Frage”, i.e. “Question” in the second column drop down/spinner

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The question should be shown
Instead you see the tags.

I am pretty sure that i have identified how this happens:

At some time the values here: https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/develop/src/com/ichi2/anki/CardBrowser.java#L143-L156
and here: https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/develop/res/values/02-strings.xml#L52-L67
were rearranged. The translations, e.g. here: https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/develop/res/values-de/02-strings.xml#L133-L142
have not caught up.

In the image the spinner says „Frage“==“Question”, the right column shows tags.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2108 Please explain your idea here.

It would be nice if one could filter cards by tags for targeted topical study The Anki/AnkiDroid
documentation suggests using tags rather than decks for card organization, but the
apps don't really let you make good use of the tagging.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ?

NO

If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2109 I learn words from foreign language using Ankidroid.
Ankidroid feeds me with new words that I should memorize.
Also I often encounter new words in other contexts (articles, web sites, movies) that
I translate using dictionary and try to memorize.
Often new words from other context already in deck that I learn, but they too far away
from my current &quot;learning window&quot; and will appear when I completely forgot them.

It would be nice feature to be able to reorder cards in deck, to move cards closer
to current &quot;learning window&quot;, so that new cards will be learned not random, but from
real life context.

Expected: the &quot;flip side&quot; of the card to appear. 
See: the &quot;front side&quot; with the &quot;Show Answer&quot; area outlined in red.  It never changes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time. I can't get it to run properly at all.  And I have done as suggested, which
is to uninstall and re-install.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

AnkiDroid v2.1.3

I don't know how to do this, or I would do.

I would really appreciate at least a prompt email letting me know if this can be worked
out and how long it might take.  Thank you.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2120 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. First we need to have a database on AnkiDroid that differ in such a way from the
database on AnkiWeb that a &quot;Syncing Conflict&quot; occurs.

2. Try to sync from AnkiDroid. Notice &quot;Syncing Conflict&quot; warning message.

3. Choose the option to replace the AnkiDroid database with the database from the server,
AnkiWeb.

4. Now you will see the message &quot;Full sync from server&quot;. And you can once again (without
reviewing any cards) press sync. No complaint about &quot;Syncing conflict&quot; this time.

5. *However*, now review one card in AnkiDroid and then press Sync again. The &quot;Syncing
Conflict&quot; warning message pops up again. 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is that the AnkiDroid database should be fully consistent with
the AnkiWeb version, even after one card review.

Instead the database seemingly differs again after full sync if you review one card.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Happens everytime with my current database.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

4.0.4 Galaxy S2 / Tablet



Please provide any additional information below.

* What solved the problem for me was that I reviewed a few cards on desktop Anki. Synced
Anki. Then I successfully synced again on AnkiDroid. The only visible changes in AnkiDroid
database was that the recently reviewed cards were correctly accounted for and removed
from the review-queue.


To summarize: During the whole time I could successfully sync and review cards on desktop
Anki. But even after doing a full sync on AnkiDroid on both my phone and tablet I could
not review any cards without getting a syncing conflict warning message again.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2121 I'd like to propose to enable decks to be distributed through the Google Play Store
(or Amazon or whatever other). I see a lack of quality decks for Anki. This could in
part be alleviated by offering paid decks to create and incentives for high quality
content creation. 

Would this be feasible?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2123 Hi,

I study English with AnkiWeb most often. I have created a deck and add 3 example of
each word in seperate cloze deletion fields. 

When I review a card, I try to listen each example by copy and paste each sentences
to a TTS app and try to repeat them my self.

I think it is great feature to have single button infront of each field so I can hear
the field without doing too much job. you can also see this feature exists in many
learner's dictionaries witch a speacker button exists beside of every sentences.

Best Wishes

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2127 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. It happens randomly in almost every second card. When I click &quot;show answer&quot; it does
not appear, I have to enter card edit menu to have a look. The rating of tree answer
is available. 
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would like to see the answer. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
 Randomly, I think for different cards. 

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Kitkat, but also my other phone 2.6

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2131 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review cards that were due some weeks ago. Used a filtered deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The cards that weren't answered 'again' shouldn't be marked as leech. However, it happened
for some cards that were answered 'good' or 'hard'.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I have reviewed those old cards for three days, it happened all the time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2133 Suggested by robert.fuller in https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=2132:

The options menu item (three dots) on the top right corner while reviewing is hardly
visible in night-mode, as it almost has the same color as the background.
The color of the night-mode options menu icon should therefore be improved.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2136 I have 42MB worth of data in my anki account. I downloaded an anki mobile app and synchronised
so that all the data would synchronise to my mobile app. However after sync there was
no data in my mobile app, only a `default` empty anki card and when I logged to my
account in my PC it also showed a default card instead of my old cards. It still says
`Disk usage: 42.19MB (42.13MB media)` however I can`t see any cards except the default
one.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2137 It would be useful to make Ankdroid able to record audios as the desktop version does
(press F5 there). A tandem partner (best would be a native speaker) could speak the
voc into the device's micro and thus complete the card with an audio. It should be
syncable. Best would be a file format that Anki's desktop version can replay also.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2142 It would be nice to be able to bury a card while reviewing instead of having to browse
the deck for it. Why? Because sometimes Anki makes you review siblings too close together,
plus there may have been outside events that can temporarily influence your memory
of a note. And some other instances where you feel you'd better try to answer a particular
card some other time.


This is, of course, already available in the desktop version either through the 'more'
drop-down menu or the keyboard short-cut.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2143 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Review/create cards with the desktop version.
2. Review cards on Ankidroid.
3. Sync.
4. Compare review time statistics on mobile and desktop versions.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect the reported review times to be the same each day on both platforms. Instead
they are different.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

I don't know whether it happens every single time I review on both platforms in a given
day. But, it looks like the time reviewed statistic differs between the two platforms
for most if not all days. There are many examples of the time reviewed being over a
specific tick mark on the y-axis on one platform, and below that same mark on the other.
Sometimes the Ankidroid statistic is higher, sometimes the desktop Anki statistic is
higher.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)

AnkiDroid v2.1.3, Anki for Windows v2.0.26

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

Android v4.4.2, Windows 7

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

I do almost all reviews (and all card editing) on the desktop version. I will often
do reviews on one platform, then do reviews on the other platform without syncing from
the first, and then sync from both.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2145 &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Save a card &quot;for later&quot;, e.g. imported from dictionary
2. open it from the list of &quot;cards saved for later&quot; and add it
3. you will get back to the list, the added card is still there
4. Clicking on any card will cause the AnkiDroid to crash

&gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The added card should be removed from the list. Clicking on another card shouldn't
crash.

&gt; Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
&gt; happen only one time?
Every damn time.

&gt; following would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app,

Sorry, doesn't work. SendLog.zip is empty.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2146 If I want to see the list of cards saved for later I have to edit any other card and
find &quot;saved data&quot; there in the menu.
Should be one level above in the card browser

On the other hand in order to see details on a card, like when it will appear next,
I have to stay in the card browser and make a long tap.

I suggest to switch both items.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2147 I am using a flash card set based on a text book.
The selection of words is weird, but to make it worse, they appear in random order,
not lesson by lesson.

1st suggestion: make them appear lesson wise.

I want to learn a word a word that is in the set, but has not come up yet. My workaround
is to put it in another deck, save and then back into the correct deck.

2nd suggestion: make an option to bring forward selected cards

the second whether the second is hiding subdecks or not.

3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see only the top-level decks with pluses after them to show there are subdecks.
I do see this but in addition I see the subdecks of the third deck, though grouped
under the second one.

happen only one time?
Every time.

Ankidroid 2.1.3, Android 4.3.

If I press &quot;show subdecks&quot; on the third deck it works as it should. Also the names
are correct, they use the third deck as the path.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2152 There exists an Anki Desktop addon which resolves one of the fundamental problems with
the current Anki scheduling algorithm: Card Due spikes on certain days. This addon
checks amount of cards due and when a spike in the Cards Due is detected on a specific
day, then adjusts the next scheduled review accordingly. The maximum amount of days
forward or back to which cards can be pushed can be configured.

This feature is available in Anki Desktop as an addon:

Note that it is one of the highest-rated and most-downloaded addons for Anki Desktop.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2161 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use a 2.3beta build
2. on an 18cm tablet
3. and rotate that a lot.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It should be consistent what happens when, for example, you touch the back button during
reviews.

Instead, depending on which way you held the tablet at the moment you started AnkiDroid,
a single touch of the back button brings you either to the deck options or to the combined
deck picker/deck options, a double touch brings you either to the deck picker, or to
the Android home screen/launcher.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time. That is working as designed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2162 This is a suggestion to make a version of the desktop Browser mode.
Currently, the one in Ankidroid is hard to just look at the note/card.
A better layout can greatly enhance how this app is used - 

imagine, itself is already a sqlite database, and searches are instant, so, it kinda
functions like Evernote.

But, instead of having two steps of writing notes AND then making quizzes out of it,
the notes in Ankidroid can be used as both - 

The setting I'm talking about is in medical school (which is a huge niche use sector).
On the wards while I'm being grilled by attendings, I can search through ALL my notes
I took and get the data I need. If the Browser mode is enhanced, this can totally increase
the useability of this application.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2165 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Write a new card with a latex formula on pc, sync it
2. Sync android device, see that the formula is being properly displayed
3. Change the latex formula on pc again, sync it
4. Sync android device

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Android device should have the corrected latex formula,
instead it does still show the old formula

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
v2.1.3

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.4.2

Please provide any additional information below.
I suppose upon sync it is not being checked/recognized that the latex equation has
been changed.
So I would suggest either to check the picture data more accurately (size, date added
/ modified) or to give the card a new state &quot;graphicChanged&quot; or &quot;LatexChanged&quot; or similar.

Workaround for now:
1. Delete the latex equation on pc.
2. Sync pc.
3. Sync android device.
4. Add the new equation on pc.
5. Sync pc.
6. Sync android device.

Now the new formula should appear.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2172 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Went to preferences
2. Clicked on reviewing
3. Clicked on learn ahead limit
4. Increase amount to 50


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I am trying to study more every day.  I have a lot of cards to study and want to spend
a long time every day reviewing.  Anki's preset amount of cards that I get is too little
for me.  I get a congratulations screen that says there is a way to increase the study
amount.  The above procedure was my attempt to resolve this, but it doesn't seem to
have worked.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)  Cannot find &quot;decks list&quot; to be able to answer this.
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) Cannot find &quot;menu&quot; from homescreen so cannot answer this.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,

Please provide any additional information below.

Only would comment that setting the daily card limit should be a very easy thing to
do for flashcard programs, and not require technical support, so I hope that this can
be improved in previous versions.  I have seen many comments on the internet saying
this is a known issue with anki not having this most basic flashcard feature working
very well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2174 I have a single deck for various computer programming languages. Right now I'm adding
c++/R/bash/etc to the text in order to determine if a question like &quot;What does &quot;source&quot;
do?&quot; (bit of a contrived example)

If it were possible to show the tags it would save me a lot of time editing and review
time lost answering the wrong question.

If this is issue is accepted I will glad to take on implementing it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2175 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Run audio flashcards on Ankidroid on Moto G 4G using earphones.
2. Unplug earphones.
3. Speakerphone does not work. Can't hear phone calls, nor can the other person hear
you. Adjusting volume using rocker buttons doesn't produce the usual beeping sound.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
See point 3. above

Happens every time, even in safe mode. Doesn't happen when using my earphones for other
applications e.g. music player.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2176 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open any deck for review.
2. Look left and right.
3. You see wasted screen estate.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would like to use all of the available space for content, not for &quot;decoration&quot;. This
is critical on devices with smaller screens. Not everybody carries 5&quot; phones. Even
if you do, it would be nice to use all of it. This is especially critical in the use
case I describe below.

I use 
AnkiDroid v2.1.3 
on
Android 4.3 / 4.1.2 / 4.1.1 /2.3.6
(depending on the device I have closest to me).

I really like your app and use it frequently, but studying countries of the world always
angers me not to be able to use all of my screen, especially when I cannot find smaller
countries. I would be very happy to have such an option.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Synchronisation is expected. Instead I see the following:

An error occurred. It may have been caused by a harmless bug, 
or your deck may have a problem. 
To confirm it's not a problem with your deck, please run Tools &gt; Check Database. 
If that doesn't fix the problem, please copy the following

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2181 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review with a model that uses non-trivial CSS
2. Open the navigation drawer (see below)
3. and switch to “Simple interface”

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The nice styling of the model should disappear.
It does not, at least not at once. The setting *is* applied (showing non-styled cards)
after going to the deck overview and starting reviewing again.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

betas.

no crash

Please provide any additional information below.

I tried it with the &quot;Simple interface&quot;, but this may be a somewhat more general problem.
Looks like settings are applied/loaded into the reviewer only when it is opened. Which
worked OK when you could reach the prefs only before you opened the reviewer, not during
reviews, which you can do now.

crash occurs. The crash report can be sent, which I do almost every time.

「指定のページにジャンプ」ですが、
今見ている単語から、自分が「ココ!」と

現在、韓国語の漢字語の語彙を増やそうと

例えば「관심(関心)」という単語があった時、
次に「심(心)」のつく単語を知りたいケースが
あるのです。そこで、「관심(関心)」から
一気に「심(心)」のつく単語(「심신(心身)」や
「심리(心理)」など)に一気にジャンプできれば
便利だな…と思ったのです。

ページ番号をつけて、「現在のページから○ページに
ジャンプ」といった方法でも構わないのですが、
このような作り込みは難しいでしょうか?

以上、よろしくお願いしますm(_ _)m

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2188 I am likely to use the Add picture to card feature from e.g. magazines or books and
the keyword is often near/in the picture which should be taken out.

It would be good to facilitate basic editing capability before saving the photo, or
even better, just allow invoking one of the phone's editors by adding a button to deal
with this.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2190 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I attached a screenshot. On the main Decks page, the time remaining is cut off.
For example, today I have 195 due cards and 50 minutes remaining. However, what I see
on the decks page is &quot;195 cards due (50...&quot; To fix this, maybe the cards due and time
remaining should be on separate lines. You could probably decrease the font size of
those lines and the font size of the word &quot;Decks&quot; above it. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
See above

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) 2.2
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) 4.2.2


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2200 Hi Team,

I love the app and been using it for 12 months. 

In the last two updates the Statistics and Sync buttons were moved from the bottom
of the main screen to the top of the screen, making Statistics a two touch menu operation
to open, and also meaning user must use a finger to open the settings menu or click
the sync button since thumb can't reach from bottom of screen to top of screen.

Hence my feature request to restore Statistics and Sync buttons to bottom of main screen,
or at least an option in settings to have them appear at bottom of main screen, so
that users can use single thumb click to press.

Another thing changed was that the Cancel and Save were buttons in Edit Card were reversed
left and right, so that long term users can accidentally hit Cancel where they used
to hit Save. Just a small annoyance, but please be wary of making such UI changes in
future updates.

Cheers!

Peter

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2201 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Select deck, choose Custom study
2. Complete custom study, upon completion hidden related cards are present.
3. Anki prompts to press unbury- But there is nolonger any no unbury option, nor is
it displays.

What is the expected output? A button I can push to unbury the hidden cards.

What do you see instead? A prompt to press unbury, but no option, or button.

If you re-select the original deck, the unbury option appears, you then must exit that
deck, and go and select the custom study deck. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every time, since today's 2.2.2 upgrade.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

In the attached deck, once you are expected to type “peace, friendship”. 
For the other, you have to type the name of the cocktail once on Anki desktop, and
“Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary” on AD.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2212 hello. my name is Sinan. i am using Ankidroid and Anki Desktop. i am studying russian
and arabic. and i want to thank you for new realese of Ankidroid. it has great features.
now i can easily add pict to my cards from web or from my pict gallery.  

my suggestion is can you also make same thing for sound files? because i have text
to speech application for Turkish, English, Arabic and Russian languages on my cell
phone.

on one of my decks i have sentence, sentence sound, unknown word in sentence, word
sound, and definition. this deck is for russian. and with android app named 'Talk',
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ktix007.talk) i can record russian
sentence sound or russian word sound to a .wav file using text to speech engine. 

So if you can add a sound option like pict option that i can easily choose a sound
file from cell phone gallery 

Or 

if you can add a sound option that with one click i can add a sentence sound or word
sound using my installed text to speech engine

would be perfect... thanks a lot for your great efforts in advance

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2220 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Take a picture on my Galaxy S5, add the picture to my card
2. try to sync with ankiweb (and not send anything more than 4ko)
3. try to show the picture on a card will crash the app

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is to make it sync on ankiweb and being able to show the pic !

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Everytime yup..


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

2.2.2.

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.4.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

sorry can't find the way to use sendlog properly, I sent you the log &quot;original&quot; from
android

hope you can help me !

thanks !

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2225 It seems that audio replay buttons have disappeared from AnkiDroid (something so good
that folks implemented it into Anki Desktop via this plugin: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/498789867).
It's extremely useful for cards where one would have multiple audio files (e.g. MCD
cards for language learners), and it's a shame it's gone from AnkiDroid. Could the
feature possibly be brought back?

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2231 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Sync on Ankidroid. Don't sync on Anki desktop after that.
2. Reduce your available bandwidth (e.g. have a shitty ISP or set your torrent client
to unlimited DL/UL)
3. Review a few cards
4. Sync again.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect it to sync correctly or time out. What happens instead is that after a long
time sending little bits of data up and down, Ankidroid decides that after all, it
needs to do a full sync.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens often enough that I try to remember to close my torrent client when I'm
going to sync... for the shitty ISP, I unfortunately have no solution. So not 100%,
but clearly many times.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
The latest version (but it's been doing that for a couple of months, since I moved
to a new place and have a shitty internet connection). Android 4.3

It is extremely annoying: if this happens when my available bandwidth is low, then
replacing a sync of a few kilobytes by a sync of dozens (/hundreds?) of megabytes is
not pleasant at all.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2235 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. go to create a new card
2. select a deck for the card (other than first deck in order)
3. add cards to deck (finish creating the card)

new cards should be in the selected deck, instead, they are always placed in the first
deck, which is incorrect

happens every time without exception

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2236 I use AnkiDroid to study a foreign language. I recently discovered TTS (text to speech)
functionality, and it is awesome, but there is one quirk - I really don't want to hear
the translations in my own tongue, but only the foreign pronunciation.

A setting such as this would be awesome:

Front side TTS: Yes/No
Back side TTS: No/Yes

What do you think?

The expected output is that I see older vocab which is in time about to be repeated,
instead I see every day the same vocab over and over again. Only the new vocab is changing
from time to time.





What version of AnkiDroid: 2.2.3.
On what version of Android?: 4.4.2.

This problem is appearing in my chinese deck which has no media. I also have a japanese
deck but there is no problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2244 When I use Anki, either on desktop or on my android device, two temporary files are
generated as long as Anki is open : one ended in .wal, and the other one in .shm
On the desktop, those files disappear as soon as I close Anki. But they remain on my
Android device. When I manually copy my deck elsewhere, the lastest changes are not
included in the deck, unless I erase those files manually (which can corrupt the deck).
Even if I kill Ankidroid with a task killer, and clean the cache, those files tend
to remain (even after reboot sometimes). Would it be possible to have a proper &quot;close
anki&quot; button in the menu, cleaning up those files ?

I use Ankidroid 2.2.3 with a Nexus 5 (Android 4.4.4)


Thanks for help

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2245 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.'Start Reviewing'
2.Tap 'show answer'
3.Cancel with Android's back button
4.'Start Reviewing' same card again
5.May repeat from 2 to 3 or...
6.Eventually evaluate ease of card - ie 'Again' / 'Hard' / 'Good' / 'Easy' 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The card should have the review 'time' according to the last time of the above loop.
Instead it gets a zero.
This may also cause it to be elevated in interval 'ivl' because of the falsely low
review  'time'.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
The frequency is often enough for me to constantly look at the sql revlog table to
ensure cards are not falsely speeded up to zero review time.
Of just over 10000 revlog entries, there were about 400 zero review times and one negative
review time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Ankidroid 2.0.1
Android 4.3

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
Not applicable.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2248 I was looking into implementing better support for this application on the OUYA console,
but wanted to know if the powers to be would even consider submitting it to the OUYA
Store?

This application is great but the lack of button support just kills it's usability
on devices like this.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2249 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Click on a deck (all decks have the same problem).
2.Click on the &quot;Add&quot; option at the top.
3.Click on the &quot;Cards...&quot; button (to Customize Cards).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

A.)Expected - I want to see a screen when I can fully customize each card.
What I see instead - a message that reads &quot;An error occurred. It may have been caused
by a harmless bug, or your deck may have a problem. &quot; (Please read the full error message
below).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

A.)It happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

A.) AnkiDroid V2.2.3

However; the feature I am having the problem with is only on my desktop version. I
cannot find the same option (&quot;Cards...&quot; or equivalent option) on the mobile version.
My desktop version is V.2.0.28

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

A.) Adroid V4.2.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

Please note: I have tried running &quot;Tools &gt; Check Database&quot; dozens of times to fix the
problem, and it does not work.

Here is the exact error message every time:

An error occurred. It may have been caused by a harmless bug, 
or your deck may have a problem. 
To confirm it's not a problem with your deck, please run Tools &gt; Check Database. 
If that doesn't fix the problem, please copy the following
into a bug report:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2254 Guys, thank you for great app and a lot of job you've done with it.

After last update to 2.2.3 I decided to downgrade to 2.0.4 despite new version is smoother,
faster and looks prettier.

Things which I dislike in new version are:

1)New buttons positions. 
Now, at the time I try to export card from external dictionary to anki using my &quot;hands
memory&quot; I tap into &quot;Close&quot; instead of &quot;Add&quot;. When I attempt to start learning a new
deck, I hit onto &quot;Deck options&quot; wich placed right where prevously was &quot;Start reviewing&quot;,
and when I want enter into card browser I eventually do &quot;Create tutorial&quot; deck instead
(which I need to delete every time later). It's frustrating.

2)When I spend out limit of new cards, deck description says &quot;you have some new cards
left&quot; instead of showing me its amount like before. That is not very informative.

3)Every time I enter in the card browsing mode, I need to select menu &quot;show all decks&quot;
instead of &quot;show focused deck&quot; and &quot;show to which deck cards belong&quot; instead of &quot;Show
answer&quot;. It would be better if app could remember last user's choise.

Anyway, Anki is great, thankyou again for you work!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2255 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Enter deck
2.View first card
3.View card answer - media is visible and can play.
4.Do anything other than hit one of the answer buttons.  Some examples:
 a) Dismiss the card (via bury card or bury note)
 b) Use the back button to go back to the deck summary screen.
 c) edit the card.
5. View next card
6. View next card answer

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the card answer with the multimedia image associated with that card.
Instead, I see no image.  No other card in the deck will view images ever again, until
AnkiDroid is forcibly reset, or the phone is rebooted.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every Time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2257 &gt; Please explain your idea here.
Have buttons whose actions is configured by the user.
Currently this is available for gestures, 
but gestures are not available when using the whiteboard.

One Use case that needs this:
Draw CJK characters with cards that do not fit the screen, as it is the case with cards
that include enough info.
Whiteboard needs to be switched on and off frequently to scroll the cards; for instance
to look at a stroke order diagram or or to look at kanji composites. The button present
in 2.2 has been removed in 2.3 and this has made reviews extremely painful.

see discussion in 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-android/kCVim4Oq1bk


&gt; Is this feature available on similar apps 
Available for Ankidroid's gestures though the actions currently do not include switching
the whiteboard on and off.

One way to implement this would be dedicated bar, with 4-5 buttons.
It's important that the buttons be always visible and actionable as any additional
click when multiplied by hundreds of reviews becomes a problem

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2264 Hi,

I have just upgraded and noticed that in 2.2.3 moving the 'statistics' and 'browse'
buttons worsened the user experience.

The release notes mention simplifying the menus and buttons. Unfortunately in this
case it means that the user has to *click around more* so the simplification is purely
visual and detrimental to the usability.

Instead of having a direct access to these options from a deck's 'home page' (see attachment)
now every time you want to access them you have to go to 'StudyOptions' hidden menu
first (unnecessary extra step).

I personally access the browse feature frequently enough to find the new way quite
annoying. I think that these two buttons should be back where they were before (see
attachment), especially that there is plenty of space available there. Why hide then?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2265 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Open a deck A for review. Say it has 1/1/1 cards to learn (new/forgotten/to recall).
2. Using the slider select the Card Browser and browse a *different* deck, say B.
3. Using the hardware Back button go back to your review. The reviewer shows you that
you are in the deck B (wrong) but you are still reviewing the deck A (correct).
4. Now edit the current card, change something and save. The card disappears from the
review (wrong) and the counter shows either 0/1/1, 1/0/1 or 1/1/0 depending on the
card type that was changed.
5. Complete the review regardless and go back to the deck list. You can see that the
gone card reappeared and the counter shows either 1/0/0, 0/1/0, or 0/0/1 respectively.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

As above. I like the idea that the system remembers the last browsed deck, i.e. if
I review deck A and then go and browse deck B, then go back to the review, then go
and browse again the system will show me deck B in the browser. But obviously this
shouldn't have any impact on the deck being reviewed.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?

every time

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2266 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Simply opening the deck. Every note in this geography deck has an image in the front.
I am not sure if the same happens in other decks.
2.
3.

What is the expected output? Image in front; text on back. What do you see instead?
Sometimes what should be, mostly no image in front but text in back. If the front includes
text, the text is visible but the image still isn't. The image sometimes disappears
when I reveal the back.

The workaround to this is, while reviewing, to go to the &quot;help&quot; page and then go back.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2267 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.download a set of cards(on android)
2.study
3.answer displays. Click show answer, and question displays.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I want to see the question first, and then the answer.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android 
version)


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2268 I found a problem with the scrolling momentum. 
If it reaches the bottom of the list, when I'm not touching the screen, it removes
the bottom bar's shadow. I can see it flashing fast. Because of that, instead of stay
at the bottom of the deck list, it returns to the middle.
It doesn't happen keep touching the screen while scrolling down.


Using Anki 2.3 alpha 8, and android 2.3.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2271 Bug 1:
1. Try to do import (add) into fresh collection with typical shared deck such as this:
https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1687853
2. Take note how deck &quot;Current Study&quot; with subdecks is created
3. Repeat step 1 but doing import (replace) instead of import (add)

Expect to see same result, but import replace ends up with all cards in default deck.

Bug 2:
Try to do import (replace) with a fairly large collection.apkg generated by exporting
your whole collection in Anki Desktop. AnkiDroid immediately crashes:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2272 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Open the application
2.select a deck to study
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Every day I want to study my decks I have to go to :
setting &gt; advanced &gt; reset languages
and then when I open a deck a question will pop up asking me what kind of language
do I need to play ( I am studying for my TOEFL exam and I need the pronunciation of
the words). After that I choose English (United States) and then everything is OK and
without any Internet connection my Galaxy note 2 can pronounce the words ( the words
don't have any sound attached to them).
But the next time that I open the application, when I want to study a deck a message
pop up:
&quot;No text-to- speech language available&quot; 
( I have attached the picture of the message for you)

and then to solve the problem I have to follow&gt;
setting &gt; advanced &gt; reset languages
and that happens every day that I want to study my English words.



Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every day!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2278 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. tap on any deck, even the &quot;Tutorial deck&quot; works after a fresh install.
2. tap &quot;Study&quot; button.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expected a normal anki study session. Instead, phone reboots within ten seconds,
like the whole OS crashed or something. When it doesn't crash instantly I can see &quot;The
clipboard history was cleared&quot; toast and a study session starting, with buttons working
as expected. The reboot happens within ten seconds even if I exit ankidroid by rapidly
tapping back or force stop ankidroid through application manager/app info settings
(which is hard to do within 10 seconds btw). No other app has triggered this effect,
just ankidroid's &quot;Study&quot; button.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

AnkiDroid v2.2.3
Android v4.1.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

I'm not sure if the logs persist through a reboot. I don't know what SendLog format
you want, but I'll try the default &quot;time&quot;.

Please provide any additional information below.

It's a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, T-Mobile, I have root and Xposed installed. I have uninstalled
ankidroid, deleted AnkiDroid folder and cleared databases in Android settings. After
fresh install, old decks are absent and I'm no longer logged in to ankiweb, as expected.
I created the offered &quot;Tutorial deck&quot; whose study button causes the same issue. Every
time.

Oh, and sometimes the blue LED notifier stays on after reboot.

Ankidroid is completely unusable in this condition. I cannot possibly be expected complete
a study session in less than ten seconds. When an app crashes it really should not
take the whole operating system down with it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2283 Hi, I am learning indonesian and downloaded the 5000+ flashcards. I am taking classes
in parallel, through which I am learning a lot of vocabulary. I would like to use Ankidroid
to review the words from the lessons, and avoid forgetting. Unfortunately I cannot
find an easy way to select the flashcards that come up for review in my daily Ankidroid
study. Learning new random words on top of what I'm trying to remember from my lesson
is increasing complexity and I'm getting lost. Not to mention the words learnt with
the teacher are selected in a more meaningful way than the Ankidroid suggestion (although
I realise it's not totally random). Please help me to select the dozens of words that
I'm trying not to forget, instead of giving me more new words!! Only once the words
I pre-selected are exhausted am I ok to take on new words selected by the app.

Using Ankidroid 2.2.3 on a Nexus 5 operating Android 4.4.4

Thanks in advance for your help!!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2284 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.I downloaded anki to a new computer. It did not download my old files.
2. I added new cards/decks to the anki on my computer
3. I tried to sync and thought that uploading would just add the two new decks I created
to the old account. Instead, it wiped it out. I still have several decks on my phone.

every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? I only synced once. I'm afraid to sync from my phone and lose
all the information I just put into anki on my computer and vice versa syncing from
phone.

version)VS980 4G LTE



Please provide any additional information below.
I'm looking for some way to create a backup or something of at least one side (phone
or computer) and then merge the two sets together. Or at least a way to put one set
of decks on a different profile or something so I don't lose it.

   On the first card in a study session, the soft keyboard shows automatically, however
on subsequent cards the soft keyboard does not -- this is an inconsistency. Since the
soft keyboard shows opens automatically on the first card, the expected behavior is
that it should open automatically on every card. (After all, if a user doesn't want
to type on a card, they can simply remove the &quot;type&quot; field from that card.) Perhaps
this is an Android bug? Note that enabling/disabling fullscreen did not fix the problem.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every time. (As mentioned above, enabling/disabling fullscreen did not fix
the problem.)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2297 Making your own flashcards means gathering recordings from all over internet. 
Unfortunately, all recordings are almost always done by different people, with different
microphones recording at different volumes.

I suggest to implement an option to equalize the volume of all recordings within anki.
At least one setting (a button which once pressed would equalize all volumes of all
flashcards within a given deck or all decks) and maybe a slider to fine tune the volume
of one particular recording in a flashcard, in case the global equalizer doesn't manage
to equalize it, or for personal conveniance or any other reason.

If the &quot;Back&quot; of many notes are same, I would like one (clubbed) reversed card, instead
of many.

For eg, if the following contents are imported..
2x6;12
3x4;12

it would be nice to have one reversed card as follows..
Front:
12
Back:
2x6
3x4

 Except for the action of &quot;Answer better than recommended &quot;,
 all actions concerning answer bottons work as &quot;Show answer&quot; in front screens.
 I like this (unspecified) working because I can study cards with quick tempo by using
an only gesture.
 I would appreciate if you would add the same working to the action of &quot;Answer better
than recommended &quot;.

When &quot;Unbury&quot; button on the congratulations message screen is tapped,
the standard study-options screen for that deck appears.

(Under the present system,
after tapping &quot;Unbury&quot; button, 
users who want to study the unburied cards need to tap the hardware back button to
go back to the decks-list screen, and then need to select the deck.)


Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

Yes, it is available on Anki Desktop as the attached file.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2316 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I put some cards here, but I wanted to put them in another deck.
2. So I go in &quot;Delete Deck&quot;
3. I loads 1 seconds and the deck isn't deleted.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The default deck continues and works normally.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
- Everytime


What version of AnkiDroid: Version 2.2.3

On what version of Android? 4.2.2

The Default deck only appears in pc version, but I clicked the sync button and the
default appeared in the cellphone.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2318 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Make latex flashcards on Linux desktop (Debian)
2. Flashcards work properly on desktop, run sync to AnkiWeb
3. Run sync on AnkiDroid.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see all the cards transfer properly. Instead, only some of the latex images
appear, and others appear as just a small gray box (presumably the &quot;missing media&quot;
box).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I cannot get it to work not matter what I do, every time some latex images appear and
some do not.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) 2.2.3
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) 4.4.2


I have tried completely removing AnkiDroid from my phone, as well as force closing
it and clearing the data, however all data remains either way! After reinstalling it,
the problem repeats exactly as described above. I also tried going on the desktop and
forcing a one-way sync, then doing a one-way sync on the phone. The same cards remain
just small gray boxes.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2323 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review with whiteboard on
2. Try to write/draw a stroke starting at the left screen edge


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The stroke should be drawn.
Instead the navigation drawer is opened.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 
On what version of Android? 

(Android 4.1)

AnkiDroid 2.3.beta17

If it is a crash …

No crash

Please provide any additional information below.

This problem has been discussed before
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/anki-android/drawer$20whiteboard/anki-android/UPS89D6fmzc/BYMkiW_624oJ
and the navigation drawer was only shown through the app icon (top left) during reviews
with whiteboard. This looks like a regression.

Afaik there has been some changes where code was moved from the AbstractFlashcardViewer
class to the Reviewer. Maybe that bit got lost on the way?

Also, when you tap whiteboard on/off 「あ」 button twice to switch the whiteboard off
and on again the swipe gets disabled.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2324 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Sync
2. While the sync is running, lose the network connection. For example tap the &quot;WLAN&quot;
in the quick settings to switch off the internet. Or be a passenger in a moving vehicle
that moves to an area with no reception.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

There should be some error shown that the sync did not work.
Instead AnkiDroid crashes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Some of the time. My guess is that the connection has to be lost at exactly the wrong
time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2325 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. When connected to the internet, ANKI droid do not open up and repeat the loading
page endlessly
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

- I downloaded the app in Korea and have been using it in China. Since I have cone
to China, the app is only available when the internet, including WIFI and cellular
data, is off.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

- Yes it happens again and again. It is inconvenient, however, I can still use the
app when I turn off the internet. Once you turn the app, it does not shuts off even
if I turn on the internet.

Please provide any additional information below.

- I guess the bug is somehow related with China blocking the web. It would be great
if there is an option to prevent the app from sending data to somewhere.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2326 Please explain your idea here.

  I think it is desirable that the current icons of whiteboard be replaced by icons
like the images below.

  There are two reasons why I think so.

  For one thing, one of the current icons, Japanese letter &quot;あ(a)&quot;, isn't easy for users
all over the world to understand the feature. Moreover, even Japanese can't associate
the icon with whiteboard and handwriting, because the form of the icon is one of the
most popular printing typeface in Japan (Ming-cho typeface).

  For the other, I think that the designs of the icons of whiteboard (including the
X mark) are not as refined as other icons of AnkiDroid. I feel a sense of incongruity
to the icons.



Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a page explaining
the feature.

   Please see the attachment below,
or please look for &quot;whiteboard icon&quot; images on Google.



----------------------------------------------------------------

  l always thank and respect you developers for making great efforts to improve AnkiDroid.

  Please don't be offended at my remark.
  I would appreciate it if you would consider the matter.

  Thank you for reading this to the end.

1. Start AnkiDroid 2.3.beta19 or beta20
2. Initiate server sync

I expect that Anki syncs with the server and comes back to the main screen. Instead
I get a crash report.

It happend many times. (All times but one.)

I want to do this to individual cards within a deck, but when I do this it turns every
card I make in a &quot; type in the answer&quot; card, unless I change the fields back to how
they were. 

How do I make specific cards &quot; type in the answer&quot; cards leaving the rest of the deck
as regular front/back cards? Thank you.

It seems like the runtime pauses or stops the app after a certain timeout. This will
mess with the sync in progress. Will have to investigate if the timeout can be disabled,
or if the sync process can happen in a more robust way in the background.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2338 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open Statistics
2. Change language


Crashes everytime:
http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_crash?crash_id=5503176123875328

The problem seems to be that the onCreateView() methods of the fragments can be called
before mTaskHandler is initiated in the Activity via onCollectionLoaded(). This problem
may or may not manifest in other ways.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2341 (Then, the study options screen is displayed again.)


What steps will reproduce the problem?

Perhaps it might be reproduced by tapping &quot;Study&quot; button on a deck which has non-due
learn cards.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

On Anki Desktop,
when the &quot;Study&quot; button of the same deck is clicked,
a message &quot;No cards are due yet.&quot; is displayed.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2344 There used to be a way to hide time left while reviewing I think. It might sound like
a very small issue, but it can be very distracting for me sometimes. Maybe it could
be included with the 'show/hide number of cards left' option.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2347 Anki could be used as a knowledge base program (outliner) with tree structure.
You would be able to put into it any information preserving its structure and order,
such as a book consisting of nested sections. Then you could memorize each section
of the book (note) separately using standard Anki methods.
You could make one-field note for each section of the book and put the notes in a tree
structure (outliner) preserving the hierarchy (structure) of the sections of the book.
Doing so, you could read the book from the beginning until the end or study it memorizing
separate sections of it (notes).
The problems is that Anki does not allow building tree of notes. You can build a tree
of tags but not notes.
If somebody develops a plugin for it, Anki could become the best in the world knowledge
base program (outliner) with a unique feature for such programs - possibility to memorize
the contents. It would be nice to have such feature in AnkiDroid too.
SuperMemo already has such feature: http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Tree
Though SuperMemo does not have Android version.
As an example of an outliner, check the best outliner TreNotes (Windows and Android
versions): http://discoverfuture.blogspot.com/2012/09/best-knowledge-base-programs.html

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2348 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start from scratch
2. In empty deck picker, click on sync button
3. Select `Login`
4. Enter credentials
5. Click `Login`
6. Crash

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
No crash.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
2.3 Beta 42 in Chrome OS

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
See attached log.txt.

Please provide any additional information below.
This is new, I have successfully entered my credentials several times in the last couple
of days (I think yesterday, too). Will run some more tests at home, including if the
crash occurs in the Nexus 10 emulator.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2349 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Created a deck with around 5000 entries and 100 tags on Anki Mac
2.Imported the deck to ankidroid successfuly and it works fine
3.When I want to add a new entry in the deck, only a limited number of previously created
tags appear. Probably tags were not imported properly.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: All tags imported with the deck and visible when a new entry is created in
the deck
What i see: Only around 10 tags visible

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2350 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have several decks with lots of media (17k in my case) on the Anki central server
2. with only changing the decks (not adding/removing media), sync ankidroid
3. wait for several minutes for Ankidroid to check for media changes.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It seems that the code for checking out whether there were any media changes does not
scale well. I'm sure there's a much faster way to check for changes. Right now, it's
quite unpractical to sync, with every time having to wait for many minutes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2351 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Editing note: tap on &quot;Tags:&quot;
2. search for a tag to remove
3. tap on the red tick mark, deselecting it
4. tap Select
5. the tag will still be present

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

When instead only scrolling down the tag list and tapping on the red tick mark to deactivate
it, then Select, the removing of the tag works fine.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Can be reliably reproduced.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2352 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Download a shared deck via Firefox
2. Open the download (pick AnkiDroid if asked)
3. Watch the import dialog in AnkiDroid
4. See that all four items in that dialog are checked or at 100%

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

When the fourth line got its check mark, i assumed that the import was finished, but
it still took quite a while.

I then pressed the home button and went back to AnkiDroid. The import dialog was gone,
but apparently the import wasn't finished. 

Then i touched &quot;Sync&quot; and after a while got &quot;Sync finished&quot; an an empty deck overview.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

The empty deck overview happened only once.

i' ve started using &quot;Cloze Deletion&quot; on Ankidroid, but this prozess is very slow because
i've to type {{c1::...}} everytime manually and it's very uncomfortable when i add
a lot of sentences: is it not possible to add a simple Cloze botton in Ankidroid? So
it could possible to select something (1 o more words) and then just clicking that
botton.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2358 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a cloze card containing latex equations (either within or outside the cloze)
2. Click &quot;show answer&quot;
3. latex equations (sometimes!) disappear in the answer, even if they were visible
in the question. All plain text is still visible. No question mark is shown.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the same latex equations that I saw in the question.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens with most, but not all, of the cards I have that have latex on them. It
is not consistent per-card: a particular card may show all its equations one time,
but not show its equations the next time I view it. Some cards do seem to have the
problem more often, though (usually cards with lots of equations).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
2.2.3
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
This problem only occurs on my phone, which is android 2.2.1. My tablet is running
android 4.3, and has no such issue (with ankidroid 2.2.3).

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

Not a crash, no visible error.

I've forced a full media sync, and it hasn't fixed the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2361 Steps to reproduce:
1. Install ankidroid 2.3
2. Load shared deck. e.g. Mastering Chinese Characters 01: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/959998085
3. Run through flashcards. Occasionally a card will appear with _no text_, just the
picture. When a rating is given and the card is &quot;flipped&quot;, no text appears either.
See screenshots.

Expected output: text should appear.

Repeatable: yes

Software version: ankidroid 2.3 

This problem did not occur with ankidroid 2.2

1. study lots of cards on the ankidroid client
2. sync ankidroid to ankiweb
3. sync windows client.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

After sync, both versions should show the same studied cards. Instead, while I studied
&quot;1454 cards in 152 minutes&quot; according to ankidroid (which is accurate), with all of
my 20 decks displaying &quot;0 0 0&quot; (also correct), the windows client shows &quot;823 cards
in 84 minutes&quot;, and has some green numbers at some decks still.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

This is a consistent behavior since the upgrading to 2.3 Ankidroid yesterday.

I'd be happy to help with debugging if needed.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

Ankidroid 2.3, Android 4.1.2 (Galaxy Note 2)

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2365 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open the card browser for any deck and search for a word
2. Press back without clearing the search box
3. Go to search again, but this time clear the search box before pressing back

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
In step 2 the search results remain on screen and you cannot easily get back to the
main card browser screen. You have to follow step 3 to do so.

This happens every time, not sure if the behavior is intended or not but it doesn't
seem intuitive

Version 2.3 of AnkiDroid, version 4.4.3 of Android

Cheers,

Ben

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2366 Hello, I'm sorry but I'm a bit confused about where to leave this feedback. There is
only 1 thing I would change about this app otherwise I love it. Please allow the user(me)
to turn on and off the deck control settings when I want to. I would love to just be
able to tap a deck and then start studying without have a daily limit notification
or having to do custom study and figure that out etc. It's inconvienient, I'm sure
it works and all but I like having more control over my education.

Thank you for your great app, enjoy your evening

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2373 I open a note to record within a field.  After recording, I test the playback and it
sounds fine.  I then save the recording (via the check mark at top right).  I now hit
the playback button but no sound. 

I have used this feature in an earlier version of Ankidroid and it worked fine (can't
remember which version though) but now not working in version 2.3.

Devices used: GN3 and GS3.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2374 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Make sure ankidroid is properly synced with the server
2. Study all the cards available for the day in ankidroid (in my case around 150) 
3. Sync with the server

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Since there is no conflict sync should work just fine.

I installed AnkiDroid 2.3 three days ago and every day when I synced after finishing
studying AnkiDroid said there was a conflict and forced me to do a full sync. Today
AnkiDroid had synced several kB of data when it decided that there was a sync conflict,
usually if there is a real sync conflict it detects this before it starts syncing data
for real.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It has happened for me 3 days in a row when syncing after studying all cards. I've
tried syncing after just studying a few cards and then it hasn't been any problems.
Adding a few cards on desktop and then syncing them to Android is never a problem either.

I'm getting this problem with AnkiDroid 2.3, I never had this problem before upgrading
to 2.3.

My phone is a Nexus 4 running android 4.4.4

I'm always on the bus with slightly shaky network connection when this happens, but
not sure if this has anything to do with it.

This behavior began yesterday, happens every time, for all my card types, but only
for this one deck. It never happened before and makes the deck useless to me. 
Background: I'm using &quot;Safe display mode&quot; but it makes no difference. Switching to
&quot;Simple interface&quot; displays only a small box for the question.
I've used Anki for over 2 years, which means I upgraded the deck to migrate to Anki
2.  
Please help. I've enjoyed Anki on Linux, Windows, iPhone, and Android (note that I
happily paid $10 USD for the iPhone app). But for me, this bug is critical and shakes
my confidence in the software.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2385 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.load a deck which uses the {{hide:example}} field, which can supposedly hide the
actual word {{example}} on the card. (is used to differentiate notes with same Front
words showing up).
2.on the test/preview card page, the field still isn't hidden and appears hideous in
this way.
3.desktop mode works perfectly so I suspect that it's something that the android version
still hasn't implemented.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
already stated.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
yaaar

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2390 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. almost completing a study session and then finding that the again cards are left
2.Then it goes back to deck itself without completing those cards
3.Then when I tap Study, the cards don't open at all.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expected the deck to open the again cards for study so as to complete them so that
at the end it shows - congratulations. Instead, the deck doesn't show those cards to
complete them unless I go back to all decks and then enter and do a thing or two to
make it show me one card and then again a few cards are not shown. I have to go through
this process again and again. Earlier there was no such problem. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happened in three chapters I reviewed. And it tends to happen everytime I repeat
those steps.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2395 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Somehow produce a sync conflict
2. … and start &quot;check database&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The check should run. (Ideally, it should fix the sync conflict, as, in this case,
i didn't really do anything that needed the check.)
Instead AnkiDroid crashed Android (reboot).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

With the collection in this state every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2402 It's pity I don't see an option for interleaved practice using Anki, which shows that
people have +1/3 better results than using 'blocked' practice. In my case, I have a
parent deck containing various sub-decks (this is for organization). When I study the
Parent deck, however, the cards in the sub-decks are showed one-by-one, in a sense,
until I finish all cards in deck X, cards in deck Y aren't shown. What if I wanted
to study all cards in all decks, in random order? So suppose a card in deck X shows
first, then a card in deck Z, then in deck Y etc.  This is called interleaved/varied
practice (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varied_practice ) and there's PLENTY of
research to support that this kind of practice produces better learning in the long-run.
My question is: Is there a way to do this in Anki currently and if there isn't (or
there is some hack) do Anki creators plan to do this for the near future (in 1-3 months
maybe?) Spaced repetition is powerful enough for retaining knowledge, but interleaved
practice is another amazing addition which enhances learning. And Anki is all about
learning better, right?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2403 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.  Run a Anki Droid from a phone without an SD card (in my case, I was trying to use
an AVD but the SD card doesn't work for some reason)
2.  See text: SD card not mounted.\n\nYou can store your collection in the internal
memory too, though it\'s not recommended as you cannot access the file that easily.
You can activate this in the preferences (open them by touching this text).
3.  Click the link, go to settings

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect to see a setting that would let me use internal memory.  But I cannot find
the setting.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It happens every time.


What version of Anki Droid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

Latest


On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

4.4.2


Please provide any additional information below.

I suppose I'd prefer to use internal memory, but thats only for the AVD scenario. 
As you've determined it makes sense to remove the setting, its probably appropriate
to remove the UI referencing the setting.

I expect to see normal non-bold fonts and instead some groups of words are randomly
displayed in bold. This is not a problem for the English content, but the Chinese characters
I'm learning can become illegible.
After pressing the edit button the card content can be seen to include the html code

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2412 After upgrading to Ankidroid 2.3.2 my phone battery strarted draining really fast. After
testing a bit more, I found that ankidroid is keeping the phone awake while on wifi.

Uninstalling Ankidroid solved the problem.

Attached picture shows battery usage without calling or surfing (idle). Points 1-2
are idle+wifi+ankidroid installed. 2-3 idle+no wifi+ankidroid installed. Point 5 is
where ankidroid was uninstalled.

1. Study a deck in ankidroid
2. Open another app e.g. notes
3. Switch back to ankidroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
All prior versions maintained the app as it was before the switch, this was very useful
for taking notes in a study session as you can use the pie to flick to notes, then
flick straight back to your study session. Now you have to scroll to the deck and reopen
it, plus you don't always return to the same study card this way.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2417 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have a deck with Russian words (written in cyrillic) and English as answer
2. Have the query word be Russian (the reversed card does not have the problem)
3. The word will show up with 'y' in front of the word. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected is the word as written in the database, it will show up with an 'y' in front
of it (card edit shows that the 'y' is not part of the word.  

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens all the time if the first word is Russian. If it asks me the reverse (English),
it doesn't show the 'y' before the English, nor for the Russian answer.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2420 Hi,

There's probably an answer for this already but I've had a thorough look and can't
see it.

Anki currently shows me cards from the deck in groups of ~5.
When a card is learnt, a new card is added to learn and the remaining four continue
to recycle.

I would find it more beneficial to study a larger number of cards in thie 'block' at
once. I can't figure out if it is possible to edit anki in this way however?

I'm using the latest downloaded PC version from the Anki website.

Thank you very much in advanced for you assistance.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2421 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.open decks with a custom font (a japanese one and a chinese one, well displayed in
Anki and in previous Ankidroid versions)
2. the fonts are not displayed and replaced by default font


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.4 Alpha 14 
On what version of Android? 5.0


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The ttf fonts are in collection.media. It worked well with Anki 2.3.2 but as I had
new TTS problem with 2.3.2 after installing Lollipop, I decided to get 2.4 alpha 14.
Now TTS works well, but I lost the custom fonts :-) 
I'm using epxorting/importing apkg to communicate with Anki desktop. Did I miss something
?

Change the number of new cards/day for a deck, and you'll find it changed for all other
decks.  What this should do is change the amount of new cards/day only for the current
deck.

I (and I expect many other people too) am learning multiple decks at different rates,
so I currently need to readjust this setting for each deck every day, which is inconvenient.

to go out Ankid, cut it in the Phone gallary app, come in Ankid again. It's so cumbersome.

It would drastically improve the app if we could save whatever we write using the whiteboard
to each note or card 

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

The Original picture stored in Ani has a big resolution. But Anki shows me a too small
picture, So I can not read the text on it.

How can I force Anki to show me the high and Width.

It is no problem if I have to scroll the picture after I see it. 

here my templets. I hope there is an addon or a code to improve the picturesize: I
am not so good in Html. Please tell me accurate where exactly I have to put your codes.
Thats why i copy here my codes:

Front

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2433 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Add a card in AnkiDroid w/&quot;see new cards in order added&quot; checked
2. Open the deck in AnkiDroid -&gt;view new cards due today for that deck; OR Sync to
Anki desktop-&gt;Open the deck w/same &quot;see new cards in order added&quot; option -&gt; view new
cards due today for that deck;
3. The Cards added via AnkiDroid most recently will show up first in the new card will
show up first, at the top of the stack.  

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Usually the cards added are thrown to the bottom of the new card stack in a deck. 
When AnkiDroid adds, it puts them at the top; rendering the &quot;see new cards in order
added&quot; option in an inconsistent state. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Everytime


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) 2.3.2
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)4.4.4


Please provide any additional information below. Bug makes it only possible to add
cards when I can access my desktop, due to Ankidroid scheduling them incorrectly

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2434 I add a card with some colored words using Anki for Windows (color is picked from the
standart set).
After moving the card to my Android device the color isn't displayed.

Maybe it's not a bug, but I am sure it's crucial to maintain colors in the Android
version as well. For example, it's very convenient to use the colors to identify and
to memorize the gender of the foreign nouns.

Android 2.3.4, last update of AnkiDroid installed

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2441 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create two decks: TEST A and TEST B.
2. Open TEST A and add a card with front containing 'test' and back containing whatever.
3. Open TEST B and add a card with front containing 'test'. The field gets highlighted
red and it is not possible to add the card.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

In step (3) it should be possible to add the card.

My current workaround is to append another character(s), like a comma or underscore,
to the front content, e.g. test_ or test__.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2446 AnkiDroid 2.3.2
Android 4.4.2 on non-rooted device

What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create deck in Anki for Windows. Style front field to use custom font, per instructions
in Anki manual. Deck works on Windows.

2. Export deck as .apkg including media (file attached) and transfer to Android device.

3. Open .apkg file using AnkiDroid. Deck installs without problems, font file is present
in AnkiDroid/collection.media folder, but fields styled in custom font display in default
font instead. 

Problem has persisted through complete reinstall of Ankidroid and recreation of deck
from scratch using Windows Anki.

Ankidroid should do so too. When open the app and when finishing with the daily program,
Ankidroid should sync the state.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2452 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Click synchronize
sync result seems null after transferring all the data and waiting for the finishing
steps. following up/download changes.

then if i try resyncing right after that it says only one client can access at a time.
so i had thought maybe it was a timing thing or a null data for one deck i deleted.

happens consistently every sync now.
maybe this comes from using Android booster that came once while the Ankidroid Sync
got stuck without sufficient connectivity.

This has been since 2.3.0,1,2 and still present with the 2.4 beta 2

1. Anki desktop: Edit notes with any LaTeX expression, view the cards in order to generate
the images 
2. Sync on desktop then on android
3. AnkiDroid: Do menu -&gt; Check media. It finds unused LaTeX images (which are actually
used) and asks for deletion (if you do delete, then LaTeX fields won't show correctly)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It should not find unused LaTeX images if they are associated with a note or a card.
It should find only unassociated LaTeX images.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes, it happens every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2455 I wanted to copy all media files from Anki Desktop to sd card, so AnkiDroid has them
too.

If I put the files in a container, (e.g. .7z), it takes some seconds to transfer the
files to the sd card on the android phone. That's how fast it should be. But unfortunately,
I have to unzip the container to the correct collection.media folder of AnkiDroid.
That takes a long time (~1h).

It would be nice if Anki could somehow handle the files that are in a container (no
compression) like 7z or zip, without the need to unzip the files.

This would also solve the problem with limited number of files in FAT32.

I wanted to be able to type the answer in and followed steps on youtube, but decided
it was too much hassle. When I tried to use the basic note to make normal cards, the
answer either wont show up or {unknown field back} comes up instead of the answer.
This has therefore made it impossible to see all the answers from decks using the basic
note type

1. Do some reviews in AnkiDroid
2. Press the sync button
3. Wait

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the sync to complete successfully. Instead it gets stuck during &quot;Upload changes&quot;
after some amount of changes have been uploaded (e.g. 3 kb) and after some time times
out.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time, regardless of whether I do a regular sync or a full re-upload.
However, it only affects uploading; when downloading changes it never gets stuck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2463 Hi there

I opened up the we page of the shared decks. I selected Spanish and got a list of cards
to choose. I press info and nothing happens on any of them.

I selected another category (biology) and can download those with no problem.

I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.

Thanks for your help.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2464 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.add tags do a card by clicking on the tags field and check existing tags checkbox.
With multiple tags already checked add a new tag by typing it in the appropriate box
and clicking to add it to the list. the new tag will be added however all previously
checked tags: will become unchecked. 

What is the expected output? 

the previously selected tags should remain selected and the new tag be added and selected
as well. 

What do you see instead?

the previously selected tags are D selected when adding a new tag

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2466 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. mark some cards
2. make a filter deck sorting on the tag marked
3. study that deck. Even though all of the cards in the deck appear some will not be
marked any longer.

What is the expected output? I'm expecting that the cards should stay marked unless
explicitly unmarked by the operator 

What do you see instead?

the cards seem to randomly become unmarked. Perhaps I don't understand the way cards
being marked should function.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

it seems to happen every time

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2467 Please explain your idea here.

I think the Anki logo should take back to the decks page. I don't like having to click
twice and you can access the menu via swipe.

If it works also, a sync button woukd be useful on the card page.


Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

On the iOS app, there is always one click access to the decks/home page via the UINavigationBar.
Sync is always a button on the desktop version.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2470 What steps will reproduce the problem?
--------------------------------------
1. Open the attached deck in AnkiDroid (minimal test deck; one card with three fields)
2. View card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
-----------------------------------------------------
The card notes should be self-describing (three fields: one with clozes only, one with
furigana only, and one with both).
Expected: All three fields should show correctly.
Actual output: Cloze-only and furigana-only fields are shown correctly. Field with
both clozes and furigana is not shown at all.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
----------------------------------------
Tried with 2.3.1 and 2.4beta2, no difference.

On what version of Android?
---------------------------
Cyanogenmod 11.0 (Android 4.4.4).

Please provide any additional information below.
------------------------------------------------
The test deck works fine on the desktop version of Anki.
It can also be downloaded via AnkiWeb: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1123769585

I've tried switching the &quot;cloze:&quot; and &quot;furigana:&quot; tags in the fields around, to no
avail.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2472 Opening this because i do not know how visible comments on closed issues are.

Direct link: https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=2440

Short summary:

- requested a certain feature
- was told to try and convince Damian to implement it in anki core
- made issue for that in the anki tracker: https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankidesktop/10934-allow-anki-to-store-media-library-in-sqlite
- Damian opined on the ankidroid tracker that no implementation in anki is necessary
and that ankidroid is prepared to take in this feature without compatibility issues;
then closed the issue in the anki tracker

Would you take a look at 2440 again and maybe reopen it?

I have been making flashcards for study but wanted a more convenient, quick method...
this app looks fantastic but I can't get images to display correctly.  After I had
issues, I went to Browse --&gt; Cards... --&gt; and added the following string: 
&quot;
img
{max-width:none ; max-height:none}
&quot;
but images are still incorrectly displayed! I need to memorize over 600 anatomical
features for a pinned final and this is the app that will save my butt if I can get
it to work!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2476 I think we are wasting a lot of time on issues where the user has enabled simple interface
and forgotten about it, which then ends up being the cause of their problem.

It would be useful to show something on the screen to indicate that they are not using
the &quot;normal&quot; mode intended to be used so they might have an idea of which setting to
change when things aren't working the way they expect.

I'm looking for a simple mechanism, maybe even for android notification drawer or as

exists) to a specified deck and! schedule this word for the same day /next day queue.

Otherwise I loose interest by the time i get to it.

What happens instead: app crashes, textbox &quot;Ankidroid has stopped&quot; appears

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Never happened until yesterday, now happens every time (attempted syncing about 10
times -&gt; crashed 10/10, sent error feedback several times). The decks that are already
in the list still work fine.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
AnkiDroid v2.0.1

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Kindle Fire; System version:7.5.1_user_5170020


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

Sorry, not sure how/where to get SendLog... But will check around a bit more :) Thanks
for your help!

About &quot;Cards due &quot; notification number, 

(a) When the deck list is being shown,
   it means &quot;the number of the due cards of the collection at that time&quot; .

(b) When a deck overview screen (or its study screen) is being shown,
    it means that (a) + &quot;the number of the cards which are not ready to be reviewed
in the deck&quot; 

(c) When the home screen of Android is being shown,
    it means (b).
    (To be more precise, (a) + &quot;the number of the cards which are not ready to be reviewed
in the last selected deck&quot;.) 

    (the number of the widget is the same as it.)


For example, a short time ago, 
the number of the notification on my AnkiDroid changed one after another as follows.



    home screen (199)...(c) 

--&gt; deck list (190)...(a) 

--&gt; overview of deck &quot;A&quot; (199)...(b) (this deck has 9 cards which are not ready to
be reviewed)

--&gt; deck list (190)...(a) 

--&gt; overview of deck &quot;B&quot; (193)...(b) (this deck has 3 cards which are not ready to
be reviewed)

--&gt; home screen (193)...(c)



Is it intentional design?



Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2498 What steps will reproduce the problem?
hard to reproduce probably:
1. have a large set (116k cards, c. 30 decks), using windows client + ankidroid. full
sync from windows -&gt; clean slate.
2. after a while (doing some editing in the browser? exporting/importing data?) of
syncing between the 2 clients, there's a database problem in the win version. I repair,
then sync again.
3. probably after that, the two versions (win/droid) are not perfectly in sync. For
one, I sometimes get cards as &quot;new&quot; that I already did the day before for sure. One
other strange thing: I can press Sync on win, then droid, then win, then droid, over
and over, without ever telling me there are no changes. it always syncs some kilobytes.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
win client 2.0.31
droid 2.3.2 on android 4.1.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

Every time.

Via pressing back I can close the app, but the same error happens every time I try

Reboot of the device does not help it.
It is not possible to send debug info, because I can not get into the app.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2511 What steps will reproduce the problem?

My database got corrupt today as usual (see issue #2484 discussion for context) during
reviewing. AnkiDroid displayed a dialog asking me whether to close it or do something
else. Simultaneously, on top of it, it displayed another dialog asking me to report
an error and kept displaying it and reporting time and time again until I finally clicked
&quot;Cancel&quot;. Then I managed to click &quot;Close&quot; in the original dialog and close the application.

I have restarted the tablet and tried to run AnkiDroid again. It has shown the loading
screen and immediately asked me to report an error. I did and then it just kept loading
- I think it just hung. I tried it several times with exactly the same result.

When I rebooted again the application started properly despite the corruption. Curiously,
the collection passed AnkiDroid's database check. When I restarted the application
and tried again, it failed it as expected.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

If it gets an error on startup because of the corrupt database, it should display the
&quot;can't open collection&quot; dialog and let me remove the collection or do a full sync.
It should not get stuck on the loading screen.

I was advised never to touch the collection files because it can lead to corruption
so I can't clear the database manually. If the application hangs on startup, the application
becomes unusable without any way for me to get it back to a state from before corruption.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It was reproducible until I restarted again.

The reports I have sent should contain specific line in code and exception type. I
hope it'll be enough to find out why the handler did not display the dialog and let
the application hang instead.

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

AnkiDroid Version = 2.4
Android Version = 4.2.2
ACRA UUID = 87b6eb50-f685-426e-b948-bbf8619ea1cf

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2515 Hi,

My cards are zoomed to about 2x by default. I know this because with each new study
card, I am able to zoom out.

I am unable to view my entire cards because wrapping is disabled while zoomed. Very
frustrating

If I center-align my card, I have to scroll over very far to the right to even see
the card

With each new study card, the zoom is reset to about 2x

All my scaling settings in AnkiDroid are set to 100%

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2525 Please avoid that words entered within ankidroid are auto completed (this reduces the
effect of learning) and are inserted into the global dictionary (properly wrong spelt
words are added this way). Auto completion can only be turned off system wide and it

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2527 
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Trigger a caught error, for example when syncing (access a non-existant property
of a JSON object for example in media.java)
2. You will see a message on screen, but no stacktrace


If you know how, could someone add a Stacktrace to Anki's error message window? It
is a problem because I got last night a socket error and I don't know where it was
from (I dimmed the screen, so I think it was due to Android turning off something).
There is no way to report errors caught within the application. I'll maybe post this
to the other site as well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2532 What steps will reproduce the problem?

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: Generates new filtered(? - don't think it's an actual deck) deck that includes
notes matching selected tag
Instead: Generates empty deck with no note. Says congrats, finished studying for today

Android Version = 5.0.2

ACRA UUID = efcb96f4-eceb-4e0f-a8c6-bbdc5546fa4e

/!\ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION /!\

The problem seems to come from the fact that the generated search field for the custom
study limited to a particular tag doesn't have quotes around the tag: it goes:

deck:&quot;Deck1&quot; (tag:foo(bar) )

and fails, whereas it would succeed as:

deck:&quot;Deck1&quot; tag:&quot;foo(bar)&quot;

I don't know why there is an added space, I also don't know why it isn't:

deck:&quot;Deck1&quot; tag:&quot;foo(bar)&quot;

Maybe '))' acts like a specific syntax and the space is to avoid that, but it fails
because ') )' registers as the same syntax?

anyway, it should be an easy fix. I would gladly do it but I'm not a developer.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2534 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Reviewing cards.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It seems that the first card reviewed doesn't count to change the number of cards due.
For instance, if at the start it states that I have four cards due (at the top: 0 0
4), then after correctly answering the first card I still see 0 0 4. Then after second
card: 0 0 3. After third: 0 0 2. After fourth: returns to main screen. 

The bugginess is also there but a bit different if there are incorrect cards involved.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It seems to happen every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2540 The attached deck (with only a single Cloze card) was created on Anki for Linux where
it works fine, but when synced to AnkiDroid, the Cloze card displays the error message
&quot;Edit this note and add some cloze deletions.&quot;

I'm not entirely sure how to reproduce it. I have been able to reproduce it a couple
of times, starting with a basic Cloze template, then adding/renaming fields, and changing
the FrontSide template. Eventually, having multiple fields on the front side causes
the above mentioned error.  If I delete the second field from the template, leaving
only {{cloze::Text}}, it starts to work again.

Since the reproduction steps are (at least so far) unclear, I suggest trying the deck
I have attached, hopefully running AnkiDroid in a debug mode (I hope such a thing exists!
:)

If I can be of further assistance in reproducing this, please let me know.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2541 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. opening the website, shows 0.00 mb media
2. trying to use ankidroid but not getting my images to load (just see question marks)
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I thought I would see my media on ankiweb (a size, at least) and then be able to sync
with ankidroid to see my cards.  Unfortuantely, I cannot see my media on my ankidroid
or a the size of my media on ankiweb.  On the desktop version of Anki, I see my cards
with media (images) without problems.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).


Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2544 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a Cloze card with multiple cloze fields, and multiple &quot;extra&quot; fields
2. Create a template using {{#cN}} ... {{/cN}} markup as described here: http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#cloze-templates
3. View the card on AnkiDroid, and all the fields are shown; the {{#cN}} .. {{/cN}}
fields are never hidden on the back side (I haven't tried on the front side of the
card).

I have attached a Test.apkg file with a single 6-field Cloze card for demonstration,
as well as a screen shot from my phone demonstrating the problem.

AnkiDroid Version = 2.4.1beta12
Android Version = 5.0.1

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2550 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Load this deck and open the one card in it. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
&gt; expected output: In Desktop Anki, it shows the card without any problems (both during
learning and as preview).  

&gt; output in Ankidroid instead: it says, that the template contains an error and that
I should correct this error in Anki Desktop (both during learning and as preview).


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes, it happens every time. You can try it with the attached file. 


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

AnkiDroid Version = 2.4.1beta15

Android Version = 5.0.2

ACRA UUID = cdc6ac28-9d32-439b-81e0-85efce11c715


The template (and therefore the card) is quite big and contains a lot of, but necessary,
information. Furthermore, the information is structured good, so that you only see
the information that you need.

I would hope that AnkiDroid might eventually open. I get the collection loading error,
and am given the option to restore from backup or download fresh, but none work, it
just hangs on &quot;Collection loading failed. Press back to close AnkiDroid&quot;

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Happens any and all times I try to run AnkiDroid. I have uninstalled, deleted any files
associated with it, restarted, and can't get it to work


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

I can't even get to the AnkiDroid options to paste debug info. I've sent the crash
info it offers when it loads initially 
Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2555 If possible, it would be ideal to disable the auto-complete feature when typing in answers.
 Most Android keyboards of course suggest spelling corrections etc, which often defeats
the purpose of entering an answer from memory.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2556 I have a deck where most of the cards have 2 cloze c1 and c2, and it worked before 2.4.1.
Now AnkiDroid displays the text twice, once with [...] and once with the answer already
there each time, side by side.

For example, the field foo{{c1::bar}} will show up as foo[...]foobar

The deck works on Anki for Windows still.

Alternatively, this could be related to {{#c1}} conditions I have in the cards, I'm
not sure. Maybe the wrong true/false is being set for those now.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2557 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create an ImageOcclusion card on desktop Anki using the ImageOcclusion plugin
2. Sync cards to AnkiWeb
3. Download cards to AnkiDroid
4. Study deck containing ImageOcclusion cards

What is the expected output?
Card should display the original image with the missing term blocked-out with a red
box. (see attached desktop.png file)

What do you see instead?
Card displays the original image, but the overlay box is white instead of red and therefore
appears invisible when viewed in AnkiDroid. (see attached ankidroid.png)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This began recently and may have been associated with the an update to AnkiDroid or
with the Android 5.1 update.  The error affects all ImageOcclusion cards, whether created
before this problem began or after. In attempting to resolve this problem, I uninstalled
AnkiDroid, deleted the data folder, and then reinstalled and resynced Anki. The problem
persisted. I also tested new and old image occlusion cards and confirmed that the problem
does not occur with the AnkiWeb online card viewer.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2558 Ankidroid currently only supports the addition of images or sound recordings to notes
from the  gallery or by making a new sound recording. Neither of these is convenient
when downloading images or sounds from sites such as forvo. 

It would be a simple enhancement to support the selection of a file from an existing
folder or the defalt download folder.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2559 The multimedia card editor already allows one to record a sound for inclusion in a flashcard.

Another useful feature would be to be able to add an existing file from the SD card,
like it is possible to add an existing image file.

Launching a file selection intent would probably be the best. Being able to preview
(listen) the sound file before inclusion would also be a nice bonus.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2562 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have lots of subdecks, with lots of cards due. 
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Each card in a subdeck should be counted only for the top level deck. 
Instead it is counted twice, for the subdeck and the top level deck. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

No crash, so I won't paste the uuid

AnkiDroid 2.5alpha4 
Please provide any additional information below.

I think this is a regression. I think it was fixed in 2.1 or something.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2563 What steps will reproduce the problem?

Not sure, it suddenly started occurring.I had made no changes to the deck.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Previously it would display the contents of the field rather than this error. Here
it should display Smith [1959]. This display issue is not happening for me on my computer,
only on Ankidroid.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It is constantly happening. I have tried re installing ankidroid, re syncing, changing
the name of the field. Nothing has worked.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2570 Using the example of myself, I would like to be able to create cards that just say &quot;do
a calculus paper&quot; And then allow me to put in the percentage that I got on the paper.

This would then be used to decide when to next do another paper. i.e. 85% would make
me do another paper in 10 days and 93% would make me do one in 13 days.

I think this would be useful because there is a very limited supply of past papers
and as a mathematics student, I find that they are the best way to prepare for tests.
If there was some way of using the app to just remind me to do a paper at the correct
time acording to: how well I have done in the past; how many papers are available;
and when the test I am preparing for is, that would be fantastic.

If there is already a way of doing that, I apologise for overlooking it and would be
greatful if you could tell me how I can go about setting that up.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2573 On a rooted Barnes and Noble Nook Glowlight (Android 2.1), when &quot;Safe Display Mode&quot;
is enabled and &quot;Simple Interface&quot; is _not_ enabled, Anki crashes when opening the review
screen with a message similar to this: 
&quot;Ankidroid has encountered a problem. We are letting the developers know.&quot;

However, I do not see the crashes here:
http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/report_crashes/

This is with Ankdroid 2.4.1beta14. AnkiDroid 2.4 had the same issue on
this device.


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enable &quot;Safe Display Mode&quot;
2. Disable &quot;Simple Interface&quot;
3. Click on a deck to review it.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the review screen. Instead: crash.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

Please provide any additional information below.
I understand that Android 2.1 is no longer supported. I would appreciate help in diagnosing
this bug to see if maybe I can fix it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2577 It would be nice to be able to set a different color per card or per label group.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2579 This is a generic enhancement ticket for any issue related to the appearance of the
application. I will merge any issue into this one that relates to:

- Themes
- Night mode
- Colours
- Layouts
- Icons

The current development build of AnkiDroid is undergoing a UI re-work. It mainly consists
of an update to Material Design and improved support for theming and night mode handling.
Any issues related to the topics above are assumed to be eventually resolved or made
redundant once the UI work is completed.

Discussion of the UI re-work is taking place on the AnkiDroid forum. Feel free to start
or contribute to any discussion if you feel your issues are not being addressed by
the update.

1. If we reposition the Cards in Anki (Version 2.03 on Linux) so that the cards are
siblings ... (Order 1-1,2-2,3-3,4-4) The Linux Version does not show the other Sibling
immediately after the other Sibling like Ankidroid does.

Ankidroid is showing me My Card1 and right after my  Card2 - but since they are siblings...


The PC Version is programmed to give it several more cards before a sibling reappears,
which is key for forward-backward learners.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2585 Hi guys,

Thanks so much for providing this awesome app!

Recently I repeatedly thought that it would be cool to be able to adjust the repetition
spacing in decks. I noticed that the repetition space does not necessarily have to
be increased every time. If I've known card after 2 months for instance, I'd like to
increase in small steps.

In case I can provide better detail, let me know.

Would be very happy if you can make that happen :)

best regards,
Andre

following webpage:

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Sync AnkiDroid with AnkiWeb
2. Reset Smartphone  and reinstall Android on Smartphone
3. Download AnkiDroid
4. Reset your collections by syncing with AnkiWeb

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect that after syncing with AnkiWeb, my collections show the number of cards to
repeat (green number). But instead, the number is always 100 or the maximum number
of cards, even if didn't have due cards before formatting my smartphone.
Furthermore, befor reinstalling my phone, each card displayed the number of days above
the buttons (difficult, easy, …), but now there are only the buttons, so I don't know
when to re-learn this card.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes, I just re-installed my phone. The bug is still there.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2601 An option to save your drawing if you want when you edit a card. Now you can attach
media, of course, but using external programs for file creation first, and then resizing,
and then saving the file, and then adding it to Anki is too much of a nuisance. A simple
drawing board to save in a card just like existing whiteboard would solve the problem.
Flashcard Deluxe has this feature, for example.

I use my phone and computer to do anki several times over the course of a day, but
my phone is running out of storage. I tried to move it all to an external hard drive
but then when I opened anki it showed a blank deck. I resynced but now my phone is
running out of space again. How do I make it so that when I sync my flashcards with
the online deck it goes automatically to my external drive, but still allows me to
access them?

Synchronization feature should be faster, automatic and should be running in background.
I waste a lot of my time just in sync and the app doesn't allow me to learn anything
while syncing. Please make it possible
Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I agreed to the new terms on my computer after an update sometime in February/March.
2. Synchronized my collection.
3. Opened up Ankidroid on my phone.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Both Ankidroid and my collection load. Instead I see just a loading screen with a message
saying that report is being sent to the developers.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I can't repeat the steps that led to a problem, since I don't get that &quot;new terms popup
window&quot; on my laptop anymore. 

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).
I can't get the debug info since the program doesn't load. It's stuck on the loading
screen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2637 Installation of the app through kindle-store worked fine. 

Installation of a smaller deck also worked without a problem because I hit the popup
immediately. 

I tried to install a larger deck then. The download took 15-20 minutes. I missed pushing
the button. When I accessed the file through the File explorer I had the message that
the 'apkg' (?) file was faulty and couldn't be installed. I tried this twice using
different methods. The third time I erased the files on the file explorer, downloaded
the files again and watched the downloading process closely on the pulldown menu. When
the download was almost finished I went back to your website, the popup appeared and
after hitting it the decks were installed. 
I'm very excited about this appband will give you a great feedback. 
Thank you for developing this.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. With a 2.5alpha version
2. Set the Answer button size setting to 170%
3. Review

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The buttons at the bottom should be bigger.
Instead they stay the same size, but the ease buttons get uglier.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

Exact version 2.5alpha36, b9a59ec 
Android 4.4.2

Please provide any additional information below.

It looks like extra space is added between the time and the ease on the ease buttons,
or above the ease when you have showing the times off.

In the left half of the image the size setting is at 100%, in the right half at 170%.
The only difference is that the text is shifted, breaking the symmetry and looking
not as nice as on the left.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2642 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card with katakana and furigana readings, preferably one where the width
of the katakana expression will be larger than the width of the furigana.
2. Review the card.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
You would expect to see the furigana above the katakana without additional spacing
within the composite expression. Instead the furigana is formatted so that the width
of the katakana and the width of the furigana are equal.
Screenshot 1 is from Anki on PC showing expected result, screenshot 2 is from android
showing the &quot;messed up&quot; version.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every time and was introduced with one of the latest updates.

Debug Info:
AnkiDroid Version = 2.4.3
Android Version = 5.0.2

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Using ES File Explorer, move Ankidroid file from internal memory to SD card
2.Using ES File Explorer, copy path of newly placed file
3.Enter Ankidroid and paste in new path
4. Receive error - &quot;Collection not opened&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Always - please see below
Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the

Please provide any additional information below.

I have a Galaxy S5.
I am trying to move AnkiDroid and my decks from the internal storage to the SD card
because I have run out of room.

However, I cannot seem to replicate the success stated in either of these pages: https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=2209
and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-android/F__t9kxW5DE

Can someone please provide me with a step by step method for doing this? I'm usually
very good with technology but this has got me stumped. I've tried every combination
I can think of, but it either says it is an invalid directory or it doesn't but still
throws me an error stating &quot;Collection not opened&quot; and &quot;Collection loading failed&quot;.
I have tried about 20 times with no success.

Using ES File Explorer, I move the Ankidroid folder from the Internal memory to the
SD card. 
From there, I copy the path using ES Explorer, so unless it's doing it wrong I know
there should be no errors.

Am I missing any steps or anything?
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Seriously, thank you for all of your help in
advance.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. (Spend some time in other apps so Android closes the flashcard webview)
2. Touch the “STUDY” button to start learning

AnkiDroid should switch tho the reviewer in the background, so that when you go back

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2666 Please explain your idea here.

The feature to mail off an exported apkg file is quite nice.
While a) most (some) of the time people will use it to mail it to themselves, and b)
when not they can type a message in the e-mail client, a bit of boilerplate¹ text would
be nice. Something like &quot;Hi, This is a flashcard deck, send from AnkiDroid. Try importing
it into AnkiDroid or Anki vor desktop&quot;, with links to the two web sites, maybe a bit
more self-promotion.
The exact wording should probably be discussed in the forum.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

Web services that send automatic mails usually contain a bit of boilerplate. Look at
the last “your password was changed&quot; or &quot;you signed up at XYZ&quot; mail. One case where
you get the chance to edit the text that still contains boilerplate is Firefox Hello
(their video chat). You click on &quot;Mail link&quot; or something, and you get some standard
text in your e-mail client.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Import a deck with just a single card.¹
2. Look at the dialog after the import


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The text should use a singular form.
Instead you get the one-case-fits-all “import_log_success” string “Imported 1 cards”

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

I’ll skip this. The text has been this way forever.

Please provide any additional information below.

¹ This problem is of course not visible when you use an UI language that doesn’t use
plurals, like Japanese, but probably *is* visible for other card counts in e.g. Eastern
European languages with more complicated rules.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have a deck with some media, e.g. 5 no video desktopexport.apkg
2. Long press the deck name, touch Export
3. Touch/check “Include media”

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The exported deck should include the media. In the exapmle case, it should be about
230 kB big.
Instead a too small file without media is produced, 4 kB in the example case.

Maybe the fix for #2594 overcompensated and now thinks some avi with video are audio-only?
No idea if this video file has an embedded thumbnail. I think that was used as a test?
In the past (AnkiDroid 2.4) similar videos were played.

(Also, it is the same deck as i uploaded for #2668, and it can be used to trigger #2667)

button. You need to have one.

Up to alpha40 it was white on dark in night mode. Maybe this element was missed during
the otherwise laudable themes clean up.

(And my quick attempted to fix this myself was too quick and didn't really work.)

Ceterum censeo answer_field esse delendam. If the input tags worked on Android 2.2,
that is.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2678 Request: Return (+) button to one-click Add Note.

Rationale:  Adding a new note is far more common than creating / importing a deck.
 With this update it now takes 2 steps to get to the very common (+) function.  

Suggested Alternatives: 
1) Move &quot;Create deck / Get shared deck&quot; functions to Main Menu drop down on top left.
2) Give an option in Preferences as to how the (+) should work (also it's size and
position).
3) Make one tap of (+) to be Add Note and double tap (or long press) to give deck option
4) Add a second button next to (+) as the Deck menu.

Improvements:
The (+) can become a very useful tool is it was made to be multi-functional - i.e (one
tap / double tap / long press / directional flicks (up/down/left/right).

Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2681 Please explain your idea here.

With a tablet, where deck picker and deck options are on the same screen, some separator,
such as a light gray line, between the two would look better.

Especially with a fresh install, with one deck (default, 0 cards) in the top left corner
and the review graph on the right in the middle the whole screen looks lopsided. At
first i thought that the centering of the deck options was broken, because there was
no indication that the white space to its left was reserved for decks.

Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc) ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

Looking at the settings on a tablet, there is a gray line between the left (categories)
and right (individual settings) side.

It would be really nice to be able to shortly switch to a different app (eg, dictionary),
and be able to switch back to AnkiDroid without having to open the deck again. Right
now, it's impossible to look something up when editing a card. not only will it close
the editor, losing all changes without warning, there's even a good chance that when
re-entering the deck, a different card will appear, making it very hard to find the
card that was the reason for the app change. AnkiDroid is a great app already, but
this would really enhance its possibilities.

Looks like a light gray background or coloring the text in blue would be the way to
go, rather than the red background. http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html

(Anki desktop uses a gray¹ background to mark the selected deck.)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2690 When I go to the Statistics -&gt; Card types view, I see 'Suspended: 25' marked with the
yellow color in the legend. Then I go to the browser, choose '...' -&gt; Filter suspended,
and I get not a single card. I was very confused.

Then, I noticed in Anki desktop that the yellow color actually says 'suspended+buried',
and the 'is:buried' filter returns the cards which are buried.

Enhancement proposal: to avoid confusion like mine, just update the descriptions in
the 'card types' view to match the desktop version.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2691 I elected the notification option to notify when &quot;Pending messages available&quot;, but I
did not get a notification when new cards or due learn/review cards became available.

I ran a couple of experiments to characterize the issue and have included them in the
reproduction steps.


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Out-of-the-box (no settings altered), the option to notify when &quot;Pending messages
available&quot; is selected by default.
2. Added a deck and ~80 cards to Anki, resulting in 20 new cards pending.
3. &quot;Study&quot; the deck until Ank says I'm done.
4. Wait until next day 11am for new/learning/review cards to become due.
5. Observe that a notification does *not* appear, even though, in the AnkiDroid app
it clearly indicates I have 35 cards due (20 new and 15 to review).
6. Change the notification option to notify when &quot;More than 10 cards are due&quot; and return
to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
7. Observe that a notification appears, indicating 35 cards are due. 
8. Change the notification option back to notify when &quot;Pending messages available&quot;
and return to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
9. Observe that the notification persists, indicating 35 cards are due.
10. Change the notification option to notify when &quot;More than 100 cards are due&quot; and
return to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
11. Observe that the notification disappears.
12. Change the notification option back to notify when &quot;Pending messages available&quot;
and return to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
13. Observe that the notification does *not* reappear.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: When selecting the notification option to notify when  &quot;Pending messages
available&quot;, a notification should appear when there is at least 1 card due.
Actual: The presence of a notification seems to be determined by the previous notification
option selected, and the &quot;Pending messages available&quot; seems to be non-functional.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I've only had one opportunity to observe this once, thus far (since cards become due
every 24 hours).


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2692 With Windows 10 Microsoft add an Option to use Android Apps on Windows.

They Say only &quot;small&quot; changes need to be made. Because the Google Services are not
available as example. I guess that in short future the Windows Store becomes more important
and these services are not used in this great app. I would also pay for such a version.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2697 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install AnkiDroid (2.5beta only?)
2. Look at Settings/General settings/Error reporting mode
3. See that the setting says “Ask me”
4. Crash AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

An error report should be send.
Instead, logcat produces lines like
&quot;E/ACRA    (21299): ACRA is disabled for com.ichi2.anki - forwarding uncaught Exception
on to default ExceptionHandler&quot;
and you get the standard Android app crash dialog.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).


AnkiDroid Version = 2.5alpha47

Android Version = 4.4.4

ACRA UUID = fa28bbf1-3e5e-4093-85da-8409da7acd68

Please provide any additional information below.

This seems to be a problem with the prefs value.
When you switch it to &quot;never report&quot; and back to &quot;ask me&quot; and *then* crash AnkiDroid,
the ACRA crash reporter comes up. But somehow only once. When you uncheck the &quot;Send
error reports automatically&quot; in the &quot;⚠ Feedback&quot; dialog, send one report and crash
again you seem to be back on square 1. ???

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2698 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use Android ≥ 4.0
2. Set error reporting to &quot;Ask me&quot;
3. Crash AnkiDroid
4. Look at the ACRA dialog

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

For Android API ≥ 14, Cancel buttons should be on the left, positive buttons like &quot;Report&quot;
on the right.
But the button order is reversed, “Report” “Cancel”

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time

ACRA UUID = fa28bbf1-3e5e-4093-85da-8409da7acd68

Please provide any additional information below.

Not sure if we can do anything about this, as this is a 3rd party component.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2699 This pertains to the 2.5alpha46 BETA. If this isn't the right forum for that I apologize.
Please point me in the right direction.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. create a new card and edit a text area so the onscreen keyboard appears
2. while editing it, try to scroll to something that's behind or below the keyboard.
3. sometimes the entire card scrolls you can get to content that's off screen, sometimes
you can't.

What is the expected output? You should be able to scroll to get to something off screen
like the tags section. What do you see instead? Sometimes you have to make the keyboard
go away to get to what you want.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? It often happens.


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).


Please provide any additional information below.
I'll see if this happens in 2.5alpha47 as well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2700 Please explain your idea here.

I like that Anki and Ankidroid have two options for making filtered decks. There is
the custom study session and the filtered deck. I wish that we could make as many of
those filtered decks as we want. I really like being able to choose something from
the content of the cards or the tags and cull out just those cards for a targeted study.
 I use this feature enough that I often have to go in and re-added options for the
filtered decks. If I could make more filtered decks I would.


Is this feature available on similar apps (Anki Desktop, AnkiMobile,
AnyMemo, etc)  No ? If yes, it could help to include a screenshot or link to a
page explaining the feature.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2701 I'm using the latest available on Play store. When I change the 'next day starts at
x hours after midnight' on the phone and then synchronize, the new value is overwritten
with the last one synchronized from the desktop version. That is: the desktop version
does send this setting to the cloud, while the Android version can only load it, and
never write.

		The pluralized string stats_today_cards_not_bold in values_NN/06-statistics.xml is highly visible. That is the “Studied x card(s) in y minute(s)” at the bottom of the deck picker. I think it should be moved to 01-core.xml. I could just move that, as i am working on code related to that string, but am wary to do that. When a string is moved from one file to the other, does it keep its translation at crowdin? Similarly, i think the naming should be the other way around. The stats_today_cards_not_bold should be something like cards_studied_today and stats_today_cards something like cards_studied_today_bold. I guess that one should stay in 06-satistics, as it is used only in the stats activity. I guess renaming these strings, if done, should wait until i am through with my time formatting changes (soon) to avoid merge conflicts.

		*Steps to reproduce: Open the card browser Press the menu button/three dots Choose &quot;Filter Marked&quot; Observe that the amount of cards displayed is shown in the top left Now press the search magnification glass icon Search with any filter you want or simply the existing &quot;tag:marked&quot; Now the amount of cards is no longer shown Personally I like to do searches like &quot;tag:marked -is:suspended&quot; and then go through and fix the cards I have marked. However I can't see how many cards I'm working with except for trying to manually count.

		I have Ankidroid notifications turned on so there's constantly a little Anki star-shaped reminder on my notification bar. I also have an Android watch, which displays the first line of every notification. Ankidroid's current setup is like this: First line: Cards due Second line: 185 Ankidroid cards due I propose that it be changed so that the first line says 185 Cards Due so as to be more readable on smartwatches and less redundant on all devices.

		How about adding summaries (supplementary explanations) to some more items? For example, &quot;Graduating interval&quot; &quot;Easy interval&quot; &quot;Starting ease&quot; &quot;Easy bonus&quot; &quot;Interval modifier&quot; &quot;Maximum interval&quot; &quot;New interval&quot; &quot;Leech threshold&quot; Especially for beginners, The items seem to be too difficult to understand without reading Anki manual carefully. For the moment, it seems to be troublesome for them.

		I was having trouble getting my CSS styling that worked on Windows and Mac Anki to work in AnkiDroid. It turned out that the problem was my use of custom CSS classes &quot;question&quot; and &quot;answer&quot;, which apparently have special meaning to AnkiDroid, but are not documented in the manual. The link to the discussion that led to this realization is below. https://groups.google.com/d/topic/anki-android/8F283rkTZVU/discussion

		I was doing reviews on my tablet, finished a few decks, decided to sync and left the tablet for a while. Then I came back and I saw the error reporting dialog. So it must have crashed because of an exception. It was the third of fourth sync today. I let Android update a few apps in the background and the update might have been still running while I was syncing. I don't know if it has any relation to the crash. Sorry for an overly generic title of this bug report but AnkiDroid did not show any details of the exception and I don't know what to say about it apart from the fact that it happened. I can't even search for similar issues. I have sent the report from the app so you can look at it and see what the error was. AnkiDroid Version = 2.4.3
Android Version = 5.1.1

		Since when I select full screen mode for reviewing, only the top status bar is hidden but the bottom buttons remain. This produces an issue for me. Since these buttons are right under the Ankidroid buttons it's easy to tap on the wrong button when I'm focusing or getting slightly quicker on learning. So I wonder if the real completely full screen available yet?

		Pretty often, but not always it seems, when I try to do my last reviews for the day on ankidroid and I still have tens of learning cards (not new cards) to do, each time I press the study button, a single card is presented, and after I answer ankidroid goes back to the deck screen, even though there are still many cards to do. If I get that card wrong, the same card is presented over and over, until I answer correctly, and then I am brought back to the deck screen. If the problem is appearing, it seems to persist until the next day. I have custom learning steps of 1 10 120. I also enabled notifications on ankidroid.

		My daughter is a quite regular user of Ankidroid - thank you for this great software! However, during the summer holidays she nevertheless has built up quite a backlog of old cards to repeat. During the school year, she should concentrate on learning and repeating the newly added cards, while not totally ignoring the older cards. How can I configure this? My idea: In the &quot;repetitions&quot; section of the stack options, I'd like to see some way to shift the weight towards recently learned cards.

		When a study session is done, the 'Congratulations! You have finished for now.' screen is shown. In this screen, the 'undo' button to undo the last operation is shown (but why would it be there?) and clicking it changes the state of the deck (I guess it really undoes the operations) - this can be seen as the screen changes to the one with the 'Due today' information, and clicking the button more times changes the state each time (the numbers change). Seems like a bug.

		I think a new fresh look would give Anki a wider range of users and take the user experience a bit further to the next level. I have here a few alternatives that I hope you all like. I used a font called RussianQuality, the creator Samuel Park says in his README: &quot;Feel free to use them in personal, non-money-making and fun stuff&quot;, I guess we fit in that description, if we don't please let me know.

		After studying an &quot;again&quot; card, it says I have 0 2 9 card to review (the again counter doesn't decrement). But In fact, I have only 1 other again card to study so it should be (0 1 9). The problem keeps on until I tap on back button (or complete the deck) Just taping on the back button shows the real stats (0 1 9):

The deck you touch gets the nice ripple effect, #3661, but the deck picked like that is then not marked with the gray background color. That stays with the deck that was active when the whole list was drawn first.

		On 2.5alpha61. Steps to reproduce: Have a deck (Parent) that contains no cards, but does contain subdecks (Child1, Child2, etc) that DO contain cards. Try to tap Parent. Receive error message at the bottom of the screen that the deck is empty. My workaround is to add a note to that parent deck to get AnkiDroid to recognize that it's not empty. Having done so, if I tap Parent, it displays the cards from Child1 and Child2 as I'd expect.

		In the second screenshot, you can see that the window height is no greater than the window height in the first. Instead, there's a blank black bar above the deck title that simply takes up space. Full screen mode is supposed to hide the status bar and reclaim that space for the study window, right? That was the behavior I was used to seeing until I updated to the latest alpha (though I sadly couldn't tell you the version number under which this was most recently working).

		In the screenshot below, there's some wasted space to the right of both images. This is despite my having changed the image zoom setting to a high value. If the images were to be stretched to occupy the full width of the screen, images that contain text would be more readable, and I wouldn't need to rely on pinch to zoom. I know CSS is outside the scope of this project, but I'll ask in case anyone has advice: Is there a CSS value I should add to the note to force the image to scale to the full width of the screen? I don't want it to just be stretched disproportionately - I want it to scale the height and width properly.

		On 2.5alpha64: Steps to reproduce: Have a filtered deck with some cards in it. Open the filtered deck. Empty the filtered deck (either by hitting Empty or by completing all the cards, which sends them back to their home deck). Go back to the deck list. Try to tap on the filtered deck to open it (which is the only way you can access the Rebuild button that repopulates the deck with the cards) Get error bar at the bottom of the screen saying this deck is empty. This error message prevents you from opening the deck and getting to the Rebuild button. Workaround: Manually create a new filtered deck using the same parameters... which is tedious to do, since it requires naming it, entering all the search terms, adjusting the card limits and other settings, etc.

But it becomes a real problem when you want to use the whiteboard: Try this: On a tablet With 2.5alpha67 Review Switch on the whiteboard Try to write an F Instead of drawing the vertical stroke, a bit of the stroke is shown, and the drawer opens. That bit of the stroke is replaced by the start bit of the next stroke when you close the drawer, a game you can play again and again, open, close, open, close.

I think, at least for me (Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, with the latest CyanogenMod (5.1.1)), it is not shown when i start in Portrait mode: And gets added some time later (i think when some activity is restarted) when you are in landscape mode. With the app running, you can force the minidrawer to appear by toggling night mode in portrait mode and force it to disappear by toggling night mode in portrait mode.

		I’ve been using Anki via the desktop version and my phone for many months (probably years) without any issues. However, I recently downloaded a shared deck that included a lot of mp3 music clips. On my laptop it was no problem, but when I synced to my phone, the sync failed because it ran out of room on my phone. I am not very experienced at dealing with the Android OS (this is my first issue with storage). To try to solve the problem, I: Completely removed the new deck from my Anki collection via my laptop. I’ve been in and out of my collection via the desktop version numerous times since then, including activities like changing a card type which resulted in a full sync with Ankiweb. I then tried to sync again on my phone but it still gave me error msgs related to storage I uninstalled Anki from my phone and reinstalled – still errors I uninstalled Anki again, and also deleted a folder that I found under System Settings --&gt; Storage --&gt; Misc --&gt; AnkiDroid (333 MB) – still errors I tried again just now to uninstall, delete folder, reinstall and again I got an error msg. I'm sorry I don't have better info on the error msgs, but they seem to vary, and just now when I tried it again, it gave me no info except that it is going to send a report to the developers (which it often says), no other info about what the error itself was, though in the past they usually mention storage. I never got them before this mess with the huge shared deck I downloaded, and since I deleted the shared deck, I’d think the size of my collection would be back to the size it was before when I didn’t get errors. By the way, after the error msg, Anki sometimes appears open and acts like I can review, but within a few cards it gives me an error and will not let me review anymore or sync what I’ve done so far. Other times Anki won't open, or immediately gives me an error (no info) and may or may not open. Any ideas?

Its colors have more toned-down tinge. Could you replace this set of colors or let users choose it on their own? Sample of colors: http://i.imgur.com/cPHODU5.png

		So I'm using a custom rom that has the expanded desktop option(which exists as an app as well right now). Basically it hides the status bar at all times unless you swipe from the top. The problem is that in the main menu I get a white empty panel where the status bar is supposed to be. Settings looks fine and when doing the actual reviews it looks fine, it's just the main menu that has this problem. I'm running 2.5-beta2.

It doesn't occur when cards are made with default red. But when cards are made in different color, this problem occurs. Thanks! This problem occurs no matter in beta version 2.5 or the normal 2.5

		(Sorry if the process for remarks to the new material design is supposed to be different than using the issues.) I have just downloaded the 2.5beta2 version to try out the night mode, something I've been longing for for a while. In general, I really, really like the new material design and especially the night mode applying to the whole application - I see myself using it a lot. I also like the fact that it is so easy to switch between day and night modes. In general - thumbs up! Now my remarks - the buttons' colors seem to be too vivid. For example, the 'plus' floating action button in the decks screen is blue, but the blue is too bright (for me). I would like the blue to be like the 'new' cards number or 'virtual' decks blue - more pastel. Similarly, I find the answer buttons too bright, especially the red 'again' button. The red and green used for the counters in top-left corner are softer and better fit the overall dark theme. In the day mode, I think the status bar's blue is too bright as well, seems too distracting. I know I can use the night mode all the time, but I kind of prefer the day mode during the day, due to less contrast. In the same vein, I think the answer buttons are too distracting as well. I think the 'old' design had them white and only the texts were colored; the new design has the buttons colored, and somehow it doesn't fit it well.

(especially embarrassing on pop menus where some text is in English between the Hungarian) The &quot;setup&quot; itself is full with english phrases &quot;Add&quot; (plus sign) popup: the last menu point (small plus icon) is wrong. The correct one is &quot;Új kártya hozzáadása&quot; Is it possible to correct immediately somewhere in a translation file? (and later I send you just this translation file)

		I use a shared css stylesheet for a number of decks so that they can easily be made consistent. As such, the css of my decks just lists the following: @import url(&quot;_StyleSheet.css&quot;); This stylesheet specifies font-sizes etc. However, when the &quot;Card browser font scaling&quot; option is changed from 100% to another value, this has no effect on font sizes specified in the imported stylesheet (i.e., AnkiDroid continues to use the font-sizes specified in the imported stylesheet without applying any font scaling). Changing the &quot;Card browser font scaling&quot; value only seems to work when the css that specifies font-sizes is included in the styling section of the card itself.

		I'm using the 2.5beta2 version on a Nexus 6 with Marshmallow. I set the Settings-&gt;Reviewing-&gt;Answer button size to 170% (the maximum) and generally it works. Sometimes, though, when I initially go to the reviewer, the button which says 'Show answer' is small (probably the default size), and either gets bigger without user interaction (but it is noticeable) or the answer buttons that replace it on click are bigger, and from that point on all is well.

		I live in Germany, and we have just had a DST time change the night before - at 3:00 25.10.2015 the clock was reset to 2:00 again. I have my 'Start of next day' set to 0:00 and it normally works. Except for today... Currently, my time is 23:28 in the current time zone (GMT+01:00 Central European Standard Time), but with DST applied it would be 0:28 (GMT+02:00 Central European Summer Time). Apparently, Anki got confused about the hour and thinks it is after midnight. I started using Anki while we had DST applied, so I guess all its timestamps are saved relative to that or something, and it doesn't store the TZ anywhere. Or whatever, I have no idea about the internals. I guess a similar issue would manifest itself if I created my collection now, and waited until the first night after DST applies again - the 'next day' would start one hour after my setting. Will it 'fix itself' on somehow, like when the times are saved again, this time with the new TZ? The desktop version has the same issue, so I guess this is not an Anki Droid thing, but who knows. Are you aware of the issue? Should I just file an issue upstream?

		I'm not sure exactly where this is coming from, though i suspect the fact that i have my &quot;start of next day&quot; configured to +5 hours. What will happen first is that near the end of a learning session it'll show my todo status on the deck as something like (10 30 0), but when i go to review, despite my having selected &quot;new cards after review&quot;, it will give me all the new cards first. Then, when i get through the new cards, and the display is (0 30 0) and i start review, it'll give me one of the &quot;learn&quot; cards, and if i select 1 hour, show it to me again, immediately, and then end the review session, with a state of (0 29 0). I tried digging around in the code a bit, but it was a little too cryptic for me to make any headway into that.

We could do some dependency forcing with Gradle if really necessary, but it might just be easier to wait for appcompat 23.1.1 to come out, which hopefully doesn't break something else. I don't remember the last time a version of appcompat was released without a major regression tbh. :-/

		Hello, I'm using card tagging a lot lately, and noticed an area that could be improved. When creating custom study session while inside a particular deck, the option to limit to specific tags displays all the tags ever created, not those specific to the deck. If I select one of the tags from other decks, I end up with empty custom deck, which is of course to be expected. What could be improved: remove (hide) the tags that are not specific to the deck you're creating the custom study session inside Hiding those tags would also declutter this window, as it's getting hard to navigate with over 50 tags or more. Anki version 2.4.4 Thank you for you consideration and hard work on Ankidroid. Best, Lucas

		I'm not 100% sure if it IS the root cause, but it is the only thing i can think of that would be a smoking gun. What happened was that, at 4AM local time (with start of next day set to 5 hours) i noticed in the statistics that ankidroid apparently thought it was already the next day. (UTC issue? I'm at UTC+1.) So i decided to set the start of next day one hour forward to 6. Afterwards i noticed that in the statistics the forecast was empty. I figured it was a display error and went on my merry way. 2 days later i noticed that i wasn't getting any &quot;young&quot; review cards. I synched to desktop and inspected the data in the card browser, and found that numerous cards were suddenly scheduled for 2018, some with only an interval of a few days. So, something messed up the data in the sqlite db itself. Inspecting the data, the relevant cards come up with: select * from cards where type = 2 and did = 1403740766368 order by due 
 For now i've fixed my own data by applying the following, where due - 858 sets it roughly to ivl - age_in_days. update cards set due = due - 858 where type = 2 and did = 1403740766368 and due &gt; 800
 It's also notable that &quot;check database&quot; did nothing in this case. In the next post i'll try to attach a file with backups of the desktop and ankidroid clients respectively before and after the corruption.

		Can always reproduce it, AnkiDroid 2.5beta10. Steps to reproduce: From main screen → Manage note types → long click on Basic note type → Edit cards. Front template is &quot;{{Front}}&quot;, change that to &quot;{Front}}&quot; or &quot;{{Front}&quot; or &quot;{{Font}}&quot; or similar → Preview. This will generate an exception (&quot;AnkiDroid has encountered a problem, a report is being generated&quot;). If the modified type is saved instead of previewed, when loading a deck which uses that type will result in a card that reads &quot;Empty card. Run &quot;Tools&gt;Empty Cards...&quot; on the desktop client.&quot; If the back template has unbalanced braces, it won't crash the application.

		I sometimes downgrade AnkiDroid to compare the new version with the old one. To do so, I have to uninstall AnkiDroid in advance. Moreover, after downgrade it or upgrading to the latest version again, I have to log in to the AnkiWeb again, and have to reset 'Gesture' preference again. I find it troublesome. Is it possible to allow the system to downgrade AnkiDroid without uninstall it?

		Setting one deck to random order appears to set all decks to random order, and vice-versa. Just go into one deck and change the order, then go and look at another deck - its order has changed too. Unfortunately, by this point it has already done irreversible damage - even if you (for example) switch a deck accidentally changed to random back to deck order, some of the random cards have already been queued up and will appear in your study schedule. This is very frustrating if the new cards are highly dependent on knowledge of previous cards in the deck. Meanwhile, I have other decks where the deck order is arbitrary and studying in deck order would be boring. What I need now is not only a fix for this bug, but also a way to return cards that have already appeared in my study schedule permanently to their correct order in the deck. Suspending the cards is not a desirable solution - the deck is very large and it would require me to work out exactly when to unsuspended the cards in question.

		Hi, I have been using v.2.4.3 from F-Droid. Last night, however, I installed 2.5 beta 12 to see how it was all coming along. I attempted to do some studying, but immediately ran into an issue. The beta is showing me spelling corrections. This wholly conflicts with my &quot;Misspelling&quot; note type, where a TTS mp3 speaks a commonly misspelled word, to which I must type an answer and have that checked on the back. Obviously since I'm being shown the answer while typing the answer this defeats the purpose. Please revert AnkiDroid back to 2.4.3 behavior of not displaying spelling corrections while typing an answer while studying. I'm sure many others use Anki this way as well. Thank you. Attached:

		@hssm The immersive API is not designed to be used together with an action bar, and touching it (the action bar) leads to the status bar appearing on top of it. This is only slightly annoying when tapping a button, but when it's the overflow menu the status bar ends up getting in the way and it feels really buggy. How about removing the immersive mode flag in v2.5 (i.e. revert to v2.4 behavior) until we can come up with a better way to workaround the limitations of the API? Alternatively, I can think of a few workarounds if you're motivated to spin something out for 2.5...?

		I see there are 200 cards ready due today, after I study about 25~30 cards the remaining card would be around 170. At this time if I press undo button for a card I found out that the remaining card suddenly drop to 125! This happens every time and I am wondering where the real problem stemmed from. Note: I always monitor the remaining the remaining cards at the top left corner of the screen.

		I use a Bluetooth keyboard to send commands/shortcuts to AnkiDroid when reviewing my cards. In version 2.5beta17, the keyboard shortcuts don't seem to be working. It's almost as if the window is losing focus. Here's what happens: A question appears. I try to press Space on the keyboard to activate &quot;show answer.&quot; Nothing happens. I press Tab on the keyboard, and the &quot;show answer&quot; button changes to a lighter color to indicate it's selected. I press Space again and it does activate &quot;show answer.&quot; The above behavior is the same in both immersive/full screeb mode and normal mode. However, in normal mode, I can then press 1, 2, 3, or 4 on my keyboard to choose Again, Hard, Good, Easy. I can also hit Space to activate the default answer (Good). On the next card, Show Answer is already highlighted, so I don't need to press Tab to bring it into focus again. In immersive mode, nothing happens if I press 1, 2, 3, 4 or space. The keyboard is still sending the keystroke, but I think the keystroke is being sent to the wrong layer or something. Hope this makes sense! Let me know if there's other information you need. I took a break from Anki for a few weeks, so I unfortunately don't know which version broke this behavior.

		The new immersive mode/true full screen hides the bar that displays whether the card is new, learning, or due, and hides the remaining number of cards in each of those categories. It also hides the timer. AnkiMobile for iOS deals with this by putting the new/learning/due counts in the Show Answer part of the screen. If AnkiDroid could display the information there, along with the timer, it would improve Immersive Mode. Otherwise, would it be possible to have two options for full screen? One that preserves the old full screen behavior, by displaying only the upper menu bar, and one that has the new Immersive behavior? Since I really want to see my timer and card counts, I'm turning off the fullscreen setting, which is a step backwards for me.

		On 2.5beta17, with fullscreen enabled, you can temporarily unhide the menu bar by swiping down from the top of the screen. If you're in landscape mode when you do this, you'll find that the three-vertical-dot menu icon is hidden beneath the Android controls (back, home, running apps). The timer is also hidden. See here: With fullscreen disabled in Settings, landscape mode displays the menu bar icons and timer correctly, like this: I like to review in landscape mode, and this issue makes it clumsy for me to edit my cards as I review them.

		The &quot;Automatic display answer&quot; feature (which should probably be renamed &quot;Automatically display answer&quot;) sounds great in theory, but I don't like that it automatically selects Again if I don't answer in time. It would be better if users could select the action that AnkiDroid takes if the time runs out before he/she rates the card. Personally, I would love to set it to Bury the card, so that I don't upset the SRS algorithm by being inattentive at the wrong moment. The current &quot;Again&quot; behavior can lead to a case like this: I'm chugging along, answering cards, when suddenly I'm distracted by someone walking into the room. A Mature card comes up on my phone, the time runs out, and it gets rated Again and sent back to relearn, breaking the SRS algorithm. This could happen several times in a row before I realize and put a stop to it. While it's true that in this case I could hit Undo over and over until I get back to my last truly answered card, it could be difficult to remember where I last left off. Also, if Anki goes idle for some time, or I clumsily navigate to the deck screen to stop the onslaught of cards, or I relaunch Anki from the notification bar, I think I'd lose the Undo capability. On the other hand, if I had it set to Bury the card if it went unanswered for X seconds, I could always unbury that card later. Worst case scenario, I see the card the next day. This is much less disruptive to the SRS algorithm, while still having all the benefits of keeping me focused.

		On 2.5beta24, when you have Night Mode enabled and you rate a card Hard, the two indicator dots that pop up above the card are impossible to see against the gray background of that bar. If I watch reeeally closely, I can just barely make them out. Having them be so faintly contrasted against this bar makes me wonder &quot;Did I perform the gesture right and trigger the Hard rating? Or did I perform the wrong gesture, triggering Good or Again, and just miss seeing the indicator dots?&quot; A cleaner solution would be to change the color of those dots to black, or change the gray background of that bar to black. Since the default card background in Night Mode is black anyway, changing the background to black would get my vote here.

		Is there a keyboard shortcut for Undo? If so, what is it? If not, can it be mapped to z or u or some other single-character shortcut? In Windows at least, the typical shortcut is Ctrl+z, but I'm using a gamepad that doesn't support multiple simultaneous keypresses so Ctrl+anything is impossible. Even on a normal keyboard it's more sensible to require as few modifier keys as possible, for speed's sake.

		A user on the forum sent me his collection that wouldn't open and I've reproduced the issue. I've pasted the stack trace below; the crash seems to be happening due to calling mCol.getDecks().confForDid(did) where did is null. After looking at the code, it's not obvious to me why it doesn't fail MORE (i.e. whenever there are a few levels of nesting), but on the surface the code appears to be the same as Anki desktop. (Note however that Anki desktop doesn't crash with the same collection, so there's obviously a subtle difference somewhere) I can get the collection to open by changing it to confForDid(node.did), but that's not what Anki desktop does, so I'm not sure if that's correct or the best solution. @hssm could you please take a look? java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean org.json.JSONObject.has(java.lang.String)' on a null object reference at com.ichi2.libanki.Decks.confForDid(Decks.java:645) at com.ichi2.libanki.Sched._groupChildrenMain(Sched.java:505) at com.ichi2.libanki.Sched._groupChildrenMain(Sched.java:497) at com.ichi2.libanki.Sched._groupChildren(Sched.java:449) at com.ichi2.libanki.Sched.deckDueTree(Sched.java:437) at com.ichi2.async.DeckTask.doInBackgroundLoadDeckCounts(DeckTask.java:490) at com.ichi2.async.DeckTask.doInBackground(DeckTask.java:235) at com.ichi2.async.DeckTask.doInBackground(DeckTask.java:66)

			<description>
		Since the last update of Ankidroid, I can't open any collections I've had previously. I can't even do anything besides stare at the screen since the error interface takes up the whole screen. I tried the several options that it suggests like checking the database, restoring from backup, full sync from server, and delete collection and create new one. The only thing that kind of &quot;works&quot; is the last option, which is to delete the current collection (which I actually don't have) and to start a new one. With this option the error interface goes away and I can get shared decks. The problem arises again when I try to sync. This is a problem for me since some of the decks I have in my collection are no longer available via shared decks and I'd like to be able to have them on my phone. Anyway, the gist of it is that I can't access my personal collection.

		I think I hadn't had such problem before verstion 4.5. In version 4.5, I need to press the shift key each time when going to write in text box or ofcourse turn the auto captilisation off globally. I've tested it with Samsung keyboard and Google keyboard. I think it would better to turn off auto capitalisation off for this app.

		The new version of the app looks great to me, but typing in the answer now produces a different behavior which I think is objectively wrong (in contrast to issue #3912, which seems to be full of subjective issues). With the old app, my keyboard app new not to upper-case the first letter of input. With the new version, my keyboard thinks it should be upper-case, which means I must use several extra keystrokes (exact number is keyboard dependent), or enter an answer which AnkiDroid thinks is &quot;wrong&quot;, because the first character of my answer is upper case, while it was expecting lower case. I'm not entirely sure what mechanism controls this behavior, but I suspect there's a simple input hint/class that ought to be set that no longer is.

			<description>
		On 2.5.1: Turn on gestures and set swipe up to answer recommended, tap to show answer (i.e. touch top, bottom, left, right all set to show answer). Set automatic display answer to On, set time to show answer to any non-zero number, and set time to show next question to 0 seconds. Review a card. Touch 'show answer' button and the answer will be displayed indefinitely. AnkiDroid will not advance automatically to the next card. In contrast, try the gestures: Start reviewing a new card, and tap anywhere other than the show answer button to display the answer, or swipe up. Regardless of which gesture you choose, it'll display the answer for a split second and then automatically rate it Again and show the next card. The behavior for a &quot;time to show next question&quot; set to 0 should not depend on whether or not gestures are used; it should be uniform. But it's unclear which exactly is the desired behavior. Ideally, the desired behavior would be that it would just not show the next question at all - That way, users can have the option to have the answer display automatically without necessarily having AnkiDroid pull up the following card regardless of how much time elapses. Otherwise, the highest value a user can set is 60 seconds, which can lead to AnkiDroid left unattended answering dozens of cards before someone notices.

		Quite often when I study my Spanish vocabulary I remember that I wanted to look up and add some word pair or, thinking about the words/phrases I study, I think of some sentence that I would like to be able to say and hence want to add it to my deck. Unfortunately, currently this is unnecessarily cumbersome as I either first have to leave the study session and then add the new card, or fire up the card browser and then add the card. Please add an &quot;add card&quot; button to the tool bar of the study screen. There is more than enough space. Thanks!

			<description>
		Currently when a card is empty on Ankidroid, you get a message &quot;Empty card. Run “Tools&gt;Empty Cards...” on the desktop client.&quot; This most often happens when I edit a note on Ankidroid to turn off one of its conditionally generated cards. Sometimes I will do this for quite a few cards but it can be inconvenient if I'm not near my computer to then vacuum them. How difficult would it be to implement a deck overview function for &quot;Remove empty cards&quot; along with the already-existing &quot;Check database&quot; and &quot;Check media&quot; functions?

		In the previous version, on opening a deck one got the deck overview screen. It took no effort to have the information available and one tap to begin the learning session. All that is easy and comfortable. Now one needs 9 steps to get this information in the Statistics tab. I find this is a step back and I'm curious how other users experience this change. Please offer an option to restore this functionality. I'm using Ankidroid on a daily basis for almost 2 years now and it's a life changer! I most like it's flexibility and efficient learning capabilities.

		There is some irritating issue in version 2.5.1 when I study a card with Input Box and gesture. A) Issue 1: need additional tap The step to reproduce the problem: I tap the text box to enter the text, then the phone keyboard appeared I enter the text I press the back button on my phone to hide the phone keyboard in order to review the card (Note: I don't press the go button). Now there is no &quot;SHOW ANSWER&quot; button at the bottom of the card. I should tab to just see the &quot;SHOW ANSER&quot; button which not required. B) Issue 2: Miss comparison with Gesture The step to reproduce the problem: I tap the text box to enter the text, then the phone keyboard appeared I enter the text I have defined Swip Left to &quot;Answer Recommended (green)&quot;. If in this state (the state that is keyboard is still visible without passing go button), I apply the gesture of &quot;Swiping left&quot; then I wouldn't see comparison result. C) Issue 3: the default input box size is too short and near to &quot;SHOW ANSWER&quot; and sometimes i press &quot;Answer&quot; button by mistake instead of a text box. By the way, I can solve the last issue by changing its size with css. I have test with Google Keyboard, Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (Latest of all updates).

		When I use ankidroid in my phone in day mode to study a kanji deck I have, for some reason the background of the card appears black, and the kanjis and part of the answer, being black, cannot be seen. I need to enable night mode so that they will be white and I will be able to read them. However, this does not happen when I study the same deck in my tablet (also v2.5.1). All my other decks work perfectly. I didn´t have this issue when I used v2.4.4

		Hello Ankidroid team, thanks a lot for the amazing new interface, a real pleasure to use. One thing I really like (although I had never realised I needed it) is getting rid of the study screen. It's only unfortunate that 2.5.2 re-introduces it. I don't really mind either way, but the current solution of having it &quot;if you type on the numbers&quot; is problematic: Using the phone one-handed means that the thumb naturally hits on the right side (for right handed people), making &quot;study-screen / not&quot; a pretty random behaviour (you're always very close to the in/out boundary). That, and the fact that the numbers have different length depending on the amount of cards.. Could we please have a setting to either enable/disable the study screen? The current functionality is less convenient than either 2.4 or 2.5.

		Previously cards with multiple videos attached would autoplay all the videos, one after the other, when the answer is revealed. This the current behaviour of the the desktop version of Anki and, at least speaking for myself, is the desired behaviour. I first noticed AnkiDroid stopped doing this in the 2.5 beta and instead started only autoplaying the first video. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/401332/Auslan.apkg (the card &quot;story&quot; has three videos attached so try resetting the progress on that one) PS I hope this doesn't sound to grouchy. I want to say that overall I love the update (the new material interface and auto sync is killer) cheers :D ~Callum Debug Info AnkiDroid Version = 2.5 Android Version = 5.0.2 ACRA UUID = 3f2e021e-15fe-46c1-a133-c20f07a67b06 Moto G

		This used to work earlier, but it doesn't work after the recent updates. Steps to reproduce: Add a large 4k*4k pixels (any sufficiently high resolution) image to your card. Review this card. Double tap on the image. Result: Nothing happens: Expected/Older behavior: The whole card zooms in, and the image is shown in its original size. Why is this important? Lack of this feature has suddenly made reviewing cards with big images impossible if you're using just one hand to both hold the mobile device and tap the screen icons. (you can't zoom in with a single hand)

		Before learning I read all cards using bury. If cards count is greater than 100, it's hard enough to read all by one day, so I shuffle cards on next day and read-by-bury unread cards (mixing with read ones). I do it via Desk options-&gt;New cards-&gt;Order option. It do the work by setting it to ordered by date and again setting it to random. Does anyone except me use this? Maybe shuffle-button will be useful then

		Basically, I have found that after editing a card and then going back to look at a card before the one I edited, the changes are lost. In fact, there is clearly something strange happening because when I press back to pass through the edited card, I see the edited card twice: first in the post-editing form, then in the pre-editing form. Once I have reached this point, the edits are gone forever. Clearly I don't want my edits to be lost just because I go back to look at or edit something else.

		Perform a couple of long press actions on the front or the back part of a word in a card; each time select &quot;Web Search&quot; from the context menu. The third or so search will start to search for a previous searched term and not the one highlighted.

		I have observed this behavior both in AnkiDroid 2.4 and 2.5. I have a French vocabulary card for the word 'terre', and two definitions and two images. The images are named 'terre.jpg' and 'Terre.jpg', respectively, as the second definition refers to the proper name of the planet on which we live. But AnkiDroid doesn't recognize that 'terre.jpg' and 'Terre.jpg' are distinct images, and shows the same image twice (which image it shows seems to be indeterminate, as I've at times seen 'terre.jpg' and at times 'Terre.jpg').

			<description>
		This is most likely an Anki bug, but I couldn't find a place to file the bug in the repo so I'll leave it here for now. So I'm using the Human Japanese deck(it's on the shared deck page). It has tags for every chapter so I've always been pulling cards away in separate chapter decks, studying them with rescheduling and then letting them go back to the main deck and continuing there. It all worked good until yesterday when I thought I was done(finished all cards in the latest chapter + some more that were still unseen because I buried them earlier) and I'd have only reviews to do, only to wake up and see about 500 total new unseen cards, some of them in my main deck, and some of them in the custom decks(which I didn't delete, because I was lazy). Having them pop up in the custom made decks seems really weird since from what I understand they should be completely moved back to the main deck once they go in review mode and the deck should be 'empty'. I also seem to be getting some funky reviews(there's a bit more than I expected) and some of them have odd dates. I tried running a check database and a check media and they were good. Anybody has ideas?

		Imagine I have the following text in a text box when adding a flashcard: &quot;Hello in English is a word used to greet someone&quot; If my cursor is just before the word &quot;greet&quot;, and I hit [delete] twice, I will have &quot;togreet someone&quot; at the end of the sentence. Then, when I hit [space], I then have &quot;to greet someone&quot; at the end of the sentence. The problem is that then Anki bizarrely highlights part of the text and I can't get rid of that text. I am running version 2.0.33

		Dear Ankidroid developers, If I name my decks by number, its order get in to trouble. To be more precise when my decks' name are 1, 2, …, 9, 10, the order would be 1, 10, 2, ..., 9. However, I have realized they arrange in nominal order when I name them 01, 02, …, 10. I was wounding if you could solve this problem professionally. I look forward to hearing from you. Bests, M.M-Rezaee P.S. Amateur solution: I have realized decks' names arrange in nominal order when I name them 01, 02, …, 10.

		AnkiDroid Version 2.5.2 Phone: Jolla with Android sandbox The app crashes everytime I hit the &quot;show answer&quot; button in one of my decks. The answer card should load a special font to show how a specific character is written. I guess this might be the cause of the crashes because all my other decks which don't use that font work perfectly fine. I didn't have any problems with Version 2.4.4

		When I tried to sync with my Ankiweb account today, AnkiDroid indicated I was not logged in. I've been successfully syncing without issue for about two years now, and this is the first time it has happened. Nothing has changed as far as my email-address or password in all that time. After reentering my credentials, I am given the error message &quot;Invalid email address or password&quot; after about 1 second. I verified their correctness through repeated typed-in attempts and by copying and pasting from a text editor to ensure both were exactly correct. I ensured that the android keyboard was not appending a space. I'm definitely using my email address and not my username (although I tried the latter anyways) I tested my credentials both directly on Ankiweb and the Windows Anki application, and it worked fine in both locations. As for the email address itself, the only thing possibly unusual about it is it has an underscore in the name (e.g. foo_bar@foobar.com). The password is purely alphanumeric and is 11 characters in length. As I mentioned, these have worked in AnkiDroid without issue for a long time.

		When I review a card with siblings that are due, and the siblings are buried, the number of cards that are due does not change. It can be updated by exiting to the deck screen. This seems to create issues with new card scheduling when Anki is set to mix new cards in with reviews, as it will unexpectedly run out of review cards early and have to schedule the new cards all together.

		This is new after the last couple of updates. When I reviewing with a bluetooth keyboard and typing in answers, when a new card comes up I have to hit tab a couple of times to get focus in the type-in section. This is a bit annoying, especially if I hit a &quot;space&quot; key while typing before I realize I don't have focus, then the answer shows up before I'm ready.

		New feature that makes a single card, with all the note's clozes to be reviewed that day, from one cloze type note instead of as many cards as the number of clozes in the note. Reviews are done with auto scrolling down the single card. Note's clozes to be reviewed that day, while are being answered successively from top to bottom of the card, simultaneously, the screen view keeps moving down the card. This is useful for learning a whole lengthy essay by eliminating the problem of &quot;dissociation from context&quot; that occurs from apparent randomness arising in reviews of the many cards made out of one cloze type note. One gets to go through and learn the whole essay &quot;in the order&quot; it exists and needs to be learnt.

		Since a couple of versions ago, a lot of the cards in my decks don't show the answer field anymore. It are always cards with an optional third field that's shown alongside the answer in either direction. These used to work perfectly but suddenly the answer started looking like the screenshot below, only showing that third field and not the actual translation. I am using the latest beta release, but this bug has been present for a couple of weeks already. I'd be happy to provide you with any additional information to troubleshoot the issue.

		It would be great if you could have the tags for each card showing in a list down the bottom of each card. A good use case for this is if you have a Deck called 'Programming Languages' your question could be the same: how do you declare a variable? But your answer will be different depending on what the language is. I tag the cards with a language tag on Anki (OSX version) but I am unable to see the tag on AnkiDroid without editing the card. It would be great if down the bottom of each card you could show the list of tags. This might be good to have as a per Deck setting. Thanks

		I have noticed that randomly cards will be marked as Suspended, Marked or Leech using AnkiDroid by simply answering the card. e.g. on occasion clicking on '1d GOOD' will mark the card as Suspended/Marked/Leech. It appears to happen randomly. The occurrence rate is approximately once per 1000 cards. I have not noticed any pattern as to when this happens. I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy S5 and using AnkiDroid 2.5.4 - however I believe this problem has been going on for at least 6 months, perhaps even longer.

		Hi, I just got a new phone (Doogee X5 running android 5.1) and downloaded AnkiDroid 2.5.4 onto it from the Play store. When I first opened the app, it let me log on and seemed to be synching, but when I went back later it crashed on opening and has crashed on opening ever since. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times, even deleting all anki related data from my phone. This has not worked. On opening the app, a small grey box appears saying &quot;AnkiDroid has encountered a problem; a report is being sent to the developers...&quot; Then the main app opens with a big white error box saying &quot;collection not opened&quot;. I have tried all the options given: 'Retry opening' just brings up the same error message, 'restore from backup' doesn't do anything as there is no backup on the phone to restore from, 'Full sync from server' brings up the same little grey box and crashes out of the app altogether, 'delete collection and create new one' just seems to make the app hang with the little spinning circle timer thing going round and round. Anki on my desktop still works fine and I have been able to sync it with no problems, so it must be a problem with AnkiDroid and not my decks. Here is what the debug info says: AnkiDroid Version = 2.5.4 Android Version = 5.1 ACRA UUID = 72f41c2f-55b8-4a29-a067-7c1a755979bd Please let me know if there's a way to fix this Edit - Have just tried an APK install of version 2.5beta16 Has the same problems, although I did notice something flash up briefly about not being able to connect to the database, I can't seem to get that message up again though ACRA UUID = 93cfda89-bbc9-4948-b2c0-20c25ec1ce6f Maybe someone who knows how to use this site could see if this one was investigated before for the beta version, I couldn't find a way to search for these UUIDs

		I've been using this app for over a year now and it used to only sync all the cards on the very first startup of the app. But now, whenever I sync, it will not sync just the recently answered cards, it will go through literally every card and try to upload them all, which takes a very long time since most of them are media files. This makes the app downright unusable now and I don't know why this happened

		The &quot;Today&quot; section in stats always shows 0 for all fields for me, as does the text at the bottom of the main menu: &quot;Studied 0 cards in 0 minutes&quot; even after having completed the day's cards. Sync with Anki Desktop is quite broken, and I almost always need to force changes in one direction. I've had these strange issues for a while (about half a year when I first got Anki, so it's not related to the new UI). I almost exclusively use Ankidroid, only using Sync and desktop Anki for major changes to my decks. This wasn't too annoying until today, the last day of the year, where I apparently have no cards due today even though I should. My guess is that some parts of the program think the date is off by 1, making today the 366th day of a non-leap year, which has no cards due since it doesn't exist.

		Go to preferences&gt;&gt;Advanced&gt;&gt; Reset languages: &quot;Reset language assignments (for text to speech and dictionaries) for all decks. Reset specific deck assignments on deck picker&quot; I cannot find anywhere a button for resetting a specific deck! Overall I think TTS could be better managed than it is now. It seems like AnkiDroid will ask what TTS voice I want each time a different cardside, deck and notetype comes up. Often this language selection screen comes up just when you have forgotten about it and you accidentally press French. Either you live with it or you reset ALL the tts settings and pray that you will not press French again when a new deck, front-card, back-card, reversed-note type, other note type comes up. EDIT: My suggestion would be to add another entry in the reviewer settings menu (Hide/ Delete, Enable whiteboard, Deck option, SELECT TTS) that would ofc only be visible if TTS was on. This would let you choose both front and back settings for the current card's notetype and deck combination. If you think this is a good idea I would happily implement this myself, but I would need some guidance since I am new to big projects.

		Hi, Moto X Android version: 5.1 Ankidroid version: 2.5.4 After installing ankdrioid it works perfectly. However, when I login and begin syncing my collection from ankiweb, the app crashes. It always crashes at 31384kb moments after the sync dialogue displays &quot;checking downloaded file&quot; (or something similar to that effect). After that crash, the app crashes as soon as it opens. This happens even after a fresh install. I have ran the &quot;check database&quot; and &quot;check media&quot; tools via the desktop app and synced them to ankiweb. I am unable to copy the debug info from the app (when getting it via settings -&gt; advanced -&gt; about) because the app crashes. I am not sure if it is an issue with my collection, or with the app. Any help would be appreciated. \ Thank you, Carl

		Ankidroid has a feature to &quot;Automatically display answer&quot;, that I can select, but then it forces me to also chose a &quot;Time to show the next question&quot; between 0 and 60 seconds, when I don't want that (for learning cards specially, I want to be able to read and think about it for much more than 1 minute). I tried setting to 0 seconds thinking it may be infinite, but it is indeed 0 seconds... Is there any reason for this limitation?

		I am watching movies with AnkiDroid and sometimes there is a card with duration more than 1 minute. Then if i didn't touch the screen after 1 minute the screen turned off. There is an apkg for testing if it will be needed -&gt; https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B85sBfBcfeSWdG00QXZ0bERsdHc/view?usp=sharing I found that this article http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/training/scheduling/wakelock.html#screen can fix this problem. And i tryed &quot;Keep screen on&quot; option. It din't work for me. But i don't think this option is that what i need. Because i want to keep screen on when i'm only watching video and don't keep the screen on when i just view cards. Thanks.

		Hi, I'm using AnkiDroid (which is fantastic btw) to learn from several different unrelated decks. But right now I have to consciously decide which deck to learn from and switch between them. I would be really nice if there was a mode where you could say &quot;I'd like to learn across all of these 3 decks&quot; and it would sample between them. I don't think you can just merge the decks since they might have different settings in each deck (e.g. are the cards double side etc). Maybe this feature already exists and I just missed it?

		I am trying to set up AnkiDroid for studying Persian. On my Anki PC version I am using arial fonts. When transliterating Persian characters, some characters have diacritical marks. For example: ظـ = ż The Persian character za is represented by z with a dot over it. This works well in the PC anki. In AnkiDroid, the z with a dot over it (ż) does not display at all on the card. It does display in the editor. However other characters with diacritics do not display correctly in the editor or on the card. One example is the letter ǫ (which represents the character غ). This is not a regular Q but rather character unicode 01EB (small letter O with Ogonek). The display for this character is distorted. Changing fonts in the settings from system default to OpenSans-Regular results in a tofu box displaying (little empty square). With the system default, it displays blank. So far, it appears to show the Persian characters correctly, but I have not really used it yet. Still trying to get it set up. I hope this is not a big problem. Android version 4.4.2 AnkiDroid 2.5.4

		Today, I have seen cards in exactly the order added even though it was set to random in the deck's option. And, I have noticed in the past that I seem to study new cards in an order very similar, if not identical, to the order I added the notes. As a possible work around, I go into deck options, check that &quot;random order&quot; is selected (which it is), then I toggle by selecting &quot;order added&quot;, let it reorder, then select &quot;random order&quot;, let it reorder, and then go back to studying. I am not 100% sure about this though, it just seems that way. I could be wrong.

		Sometimes my web connection is slow and instabile. And also (seldon) the Anki Webserver is down. A option to sync the Anki Database with a file would be nice. I also read on the google forum that a few people want to sync their Collection without saving it on the Anki server. They want to use a local Server, or just any cloud. An other Open Source Programm makes it this way: http://keepass.info/ https://keepass2android.codeplex.com/ I don't know if its easy to realize and if you want to include such future. But for me as a non developer I don't see any difficulties since all Entries have Date / Time Stamps. I guess on the exported collections now only the Information for deleted files is missing for a bidirectional syncing feature. I think that it would be a big improvement for the Anki System.

		Since the last update all of my media files are gone from both my android devices. I tried syncing multiple times, creating New cards on the laptop and to no avail. When viewing a card with a picture, the name of the picture file is displayed, followed by the rest of the explanation. Moreover, syncing to computer removed all of those files from the main copy of the deck. Part of the deck is saved with files in there on Anki web, but right now I'm afraid to touch that deck to not destroy the last mostly workable copy of the deck. The debug info: AnkiDroid Version = 2.5.4 Android Version = 5.0.1 ACRA UUID = 3ced603b-5210-467e-9ca5-c236f82e7467

		Hello, So I've been thinking about creating some apps/scripts that would use information from Anki(e.g. I'd want to make a wallpaper to display the new kanji's that I'm learning every day). I've seen there's an API for putting cards into Anki, but I didn't seem to be able to find anything to get information from Anki. Does something like this exist? If not, would it be hard to build? Cheers, Bogdan

Actual behavior: the 'marked' star doesn't change. However, when moved to another card and going back, the star does show the correct 'marked' status. There seems to be some minor issue with refreshing the 'star' when marking is triggered by double tap. Expected behavior: the 'marked' start is updated to reflect the 'marked' status of the card.

		Hi. You have the great whiteboard feature. Once you click show answer, give the option to add the drawn graphics to the answer section of the card. This helps visually supported learning and increases efficiency. Instead of visualising the answer during creation, we reuse the drawing one creates when using the whiteboard.

		The scenario / motivation : Let's say that I have an S Note document with 20 pages (landscape), each representing a back page of a card. Right now, I have to import each of the images of those pages into AnkiDroid manually, which is quite cumbersome as I have to sift through my gallery for each one. It would be great if I could do the following (the bold steps would have to be newly implemented): Push the &quot;Share with&quot; button and select the page(s) to be exported as image file(s) in S Note. Select AnkiDroid as the receiving app in the &quot;Share with&quot; dialogue AnkiDroid opens its &quot;Add note&quot; mask, where the (first/nth) image is already entered into the &quot;back&quot; field. Manually enter my question into the &quot;front&quot; field and save the note. In case there are multiple pages, go back to step 3. Receiving multiple images at once should be doable, as I can send multiple pages from S Note to GMail in one step whithout problems. This would be a really practical feature for me, but what do you think? Would this be something that you would see as useful and/or feasible new feature for AnkiDroid, too? Sadly, I do not know enough about Java and Android development to try and implement it myself. All I could find was this Android developer page, but I don't know if this is a feasible approach and/or the right way to do it. Thank you for this great app - I've been using it for two semesters now and it has already helped me a lot!

		Hi, I am analyzing ankiDroid version 2.6alpha4 with a hang-bug detection tool. I have found that the main thread executes database operations when calling com.ichi2.anki.MetaDB.upgradeDB(MetaDB.java:99) thus leading to visible hang problems. Do you think that moving this function in a background thread could improve the responsiveness of AnkiDroid? Where you aware of this problem? Hope to help improving AnkiDroid, Thanks for any answer.

		Hi guys I'm a university student doing an open source project which necessitates contributing to an existing project. Really Like the stuff you guys have done with Ankidroid. I need some simple tasks to do, like putting some comments in or renaming some functions, basically tasks which don't involve having to go through and understand extensive amounts of the codebase in order to resolve an issue. If someone could point me in the right direction with this that would be much appreciated

		Sometimes it happens that whenever I'm studying a deck, the media volume goes up by a bit for every sound that the cards play, so after some 10 sounds my volume is at the max unless I keep lowering it, which in any case is really annoying. From what I could gather, every time this happens, it's right after using a podcast app (AntennaPod), also open source, and it happens in about 4 out of 5 times after using such app (sometimes, mysteriously, everything works fine). The only sure way I found to avoid it is to open the Play Music app and start playing something (although I believe any other music app would have a similar effect) in between using AntennaPod and Ankidroid. This is actually a further indication that the problem is most likely with the podcast app, but at the same time it's intriguing that a single app, on a system that strives to keep everything running independently, would be able to unintentionally interfere with the behavior of another. I'm using a Nexus 5, unrooted. This issue was present in both Lollipop and Marshmallow versions. I'm willing to dig into this issue myself, inspecting the code for both apps, but any helpful insights would be greatly appreciated.

		I don't know if this has been discussed before (couldn't find anything here on GitHub), but I think the current play button looks somewhat out of place now that AnkiDroid has moved to material design: It would be great if we could switch to an updated icon that's more in-line with the current app design. Edit: How about one of these from Google's very own material design iconset: https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/av/svg/design/ic_play_circle_outline_48px.svg https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/av/svg/design/ic_play_circle_filled_48px.svg https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/av/svg/design/ic_play_arrow_48px.svg They are all CC-BY 4.0-licensed.

		I've read the code of computing statistics. There is int variable called mType which can have only three values. I decided to create enum called AxisType and replace type of mType. There is method calculateDone in Stats.java. Second method variable is boolean. The function of boolean is not described in javadoc. I decided replace boolean by Chartype and make the method private. Then two public methods will be created: calculateReviewCount and calculateReviewTime. This two new methods will use method calculateDone. I've already implemented changes. https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/4114

		Would it be possible to add an option to prioritize learning cards over reviews or at least mix them ? Currently if i have 100 cards to review and 50 in learning mode , the learning cards will only show after all 100 review cards are finished.

		Hi, on my eink device I would love to stop animated GIFs, without having to recreate the deck with new non-animated media. Could we have a setting to disable GIF animations? AnkiDroid uses Chrome to display the web stuff in the cards, correct? I'm not sure how simple it is. I remember years ago there was an eink setting I think, but I can't see it now. Has this been made redundant and not needed? I think it may still be useful, maybe a fullscreen refresh every X cards displayed, etc. Thanks

		Trying to understand if this is a bug or not. So, on the left is a screenshot pre-studying (i.e., zero cards studied today). On the right is a screenshot after about 20 mins of studying. What's caught my attention is it says &quot;25 cards studied ...&quot;. But if you look at the original numbers, shouldn't that number be around 45? Now another picture On the left I am studying and the review due count is 159. I hit the back button and the review due count drops down to 155. (removed content of card on left) So are there cards being buried, or is something else happening? It's very confusing having things like mismatched due numbers and &quot;cards studied&quot;, or due counts that drop 4 cards in the span of 1 second. Please explain (thank you)

		Thanks for looking into this matter, I use Anki on daily basis for almost 3 years now and I'm grateful to work with this great multi platform app. AnkiDroid Version = 2.5.4 Android Version = 5.0.2 ACRA UUID = 2118b490-e0ca-4db3-a9dd-affefcb469a3 This issue occurs on Android, as well as on Windows I commented the issue in the attached pictures I guess the inconsistecy began after having performed a study session &quot;review ahead&quot; two weeks ago, but it persists

		I have created add-on for Anki that saves depth information from LaTeX and then apply it to images when they are displayed. You can look it at AnkiWeb or just see it's code at GitHub Gist. Now, I want to port it to AnkiDroid so I would see beautifully aligned images on all my devices. However, I have some problems with porting because I'm not familiar with AnkiDroid code. First, if you see my code in Gist, you will found that I have wrapped Anki methods with my own functions which modifies their output, but there is no such tool in AnkiDroid. I can just patch already existing methods like matshch/Anki-Android@762717329e4d886ca00714f234f58bf0e95181c6 but I'm not sure is it OK or we should create some other way to do this. Other trouble is enabling of this patch. I think it should be some option in settings like done for FEN, but how to implement it? Enabling of FEN just installs hook... Other way is to not create options and to check depth info every time and just ignore lack of this files. Maybe I should create a filter on result of required methods? Then, it will be easy to solve both problems. What do you think about it? 😕 1

		AnkiDroid, when installed as a Chrome App on ChromeOS, sets itself as a default viewer of various filetypes, most notably zip files, which is extremely annoying (instead of mounting zip file contents as a virtual folder, Anki is started). There seems to be no explicit way to turn that association off in ChromeOS after the app has been installed.

		@glutanimate, @hssm, @ospalh, thank you for the refinement on the new &quot;play media&quot; icon. (#4104, #4106, #4152) I also like it. However, the position of the triangle seems to be a bit too high when it is next to strings whose size is standard (20px). (On Anki Desktop, the &quot;play media&quot; icons are on proper positions, relatively. ) On that point, the icon has yet to be refined, I think. What do you think about it?

		&quot;Deck Options&quot; should be simply another setting and belong under the &quot;Settings&quot; menu. What is the rationale for hiding it inside an individual Deck? If I change anything in &quot;Deck Options&quot; it is changed for ALL decks - the definition of a global settings. It was always wrong but now with the latest changes to Anki it's even worse. If you have studied all your cards for the day you can't enter a deck anymore. Therefore you can't change the global settings for, say, new cards until tomorrow, when the decks become available again. Or you have to create a temporary deck, enter it, change the &quot;Deck Option&quot;, and then delete the temporary deck. This is plainly wrong.

		Hi! I have been using ankiDroid for a long time. Today I did a &quot;check media,&quot; which took a long time, and then afterwords when I pressed the sync button, I was surprised to see it doing a full upload. I canceled the sync, I believe that I synced from my computer first, and then I went to SETTINGS -&gt; ADVANCED -&gt; FORCE FULL SYNC so that it would download rather than upload the full sync. It started doing the full sync, as far as I could tell, so I put the phone in my pocket to let it work. A few minutes later I looked and found it doing a full upload instead of download. So I let it complete its work and hoped that no damage was done. (I will back up my data after this). It didn't seem like it should be uploading when I specified that it should be downloading. Sorry I have not attempted to recreate this behavior, as the data is valuable to me. AnkiDroid Version = 2.5.4 Android Version = 4.4.4 ACRA UUID = 8726d1f4-6ab0-4eb5-bc6d-4a19d860f231

		Hello, developers of AnkiDroid, I have just found out AsyncTask.execute is used in many places like 5 times in LoadPronounciationActivity, 4 times in AnkiStatsTaskHandler, etc. However, this API is slower on devices with version higher than Android 3.0. As tasks started by this API are executed serially on a single background thread on those devices (stated in API guide). Using method executeOnExecutor to achieve real multi-thread may improve the performance. Thanks a lot.

		Dear all, first of all thanks for developing this great piece of software. Recently I found out about the https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki note type and added it to my desktop anki. Now AnkiDroid crashes as soon as I try to sync and as soon as I start AnkiDroid again it crashes again. Only resetting AnkiDroid, deleting the collection, removing the note type on my desktop version and then syncing the collection without beforementioned notetype to AnkiDroid makes it work again. Thanks

			<description>
		Currently AnkiDroid (with night mode enabled) makes a white background flickering each time a card is changed to the next. It's very irritating and defeats the purpose of a night mode option. What steps will reproduce the problem? Open normal study for any deck in night mode and go thought the cards. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Black colored background always. A white flickering background each time I press next card or show answer. Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one time? Yes. Happens always. What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.6 alpha 30 I know from others' reports this issue has been reopen multiples times since version 2.0.1

		When recording a sound, if you validate the card by pressing the tick upper right without stopping the recording first, the record does not stop, it is not kept and it crash the recording. Ideal, when record, any key should stop the record and save the recording on the card.

		&quot;Add undo last stroke feature to whiteboard&quot; #4245 will please many users. However, its icon seems to leave room for improvement. How about changing the current undo icon to more intuitive and visual one? For example, how about this? https://materialdesignicons.com/icon/eraser-variant It can be interpreted as erasing a single line.

		I came across these two issues today: If the whiteboard is enabled and in landscape mode, the answer buttons cannot be interacted with: In full screen mode, if you turn off the screen and turn it back on again, the system bars appear over the content. Showing and dismissing the system bars will fix it, so it's not a major problem. Doesn't have to be in landscape but it's a lot more evident there:

		I have Android 5.1 phone with internal 16 Gb of storage. I installed Anki, downloaded a deck, started to study. All is OK. But one day I inserted an SD card. Now my decks are gone. In Settings-&gt;Advanced, i found &quot;Collection path&quot;, which is set to '/sdcard/AnkiDroid' But my collection is on internal phone storage, not SD card. I don't know path to internal storage, what should I do?

		In AnkiDroid, the Review Count and Review Time graphs look like this: http://i.imgur.com/CaQrv9J.jpg However on the desktop version of Anki, the &quot;cram&quot; part is at the top: http://i.imgur.com/z6vMwqc.png For consistency, I think it'd be a good idea for the graph to look the same as the desktop version. It's also a lot harder to visually compare regular reviews from day-to-day when it's like this.

		AnkiDroid 2.6 modified the behavior of the clear whiteboard button. Previously it cleared the entire whiteboard (what I'd like to have back), now it removes the last stroke. I'm studying Kanji with the whiteboard and for me it doesn't make sense to clear the last stroke. It's easier to write the whole thing again. That would happen when writing with a pen anyway. Make it configurable in the settings please. Thank you. Maybe make long press clear the whole board or something.

		Consider using the sqlite-android library. Potentially good things (haven't looked into it in detail yet): It may not have the 2MB cursor limit that's been plaguing us forever It might free us from &quot;clever&quot; vendor implementations (like the one with the hard-wired WAL mode) It might be more stable on older devices by providing the latest bugfixes More consistent DB behavior across devices

I enter &quot;convince&quot; and it's meaning After entering some other words with same note type to the same deck, accidentally I enter &quot;convince&quot; again. By the way first field's bottom line turned red but I was kinda making it quickly so I didn't realize it and I hit OK button located up right. Anki added &quot;convince&quot; again and then all fields bottom lines turned red. Expected Result To act normally Note: I think for a situation like this the matching first field which was turning completely pink/red was better like in the early versions. Like in my situation bottom line which is turning to red sometimes can't be noticed because it's so little to realize and when in the first field entering an existing word in the deck bottom line turns to gray which is covering the red line like in picture. Actual Result When I was entering new words to a deck, I accidentally add same word twice. And then alI fields turned to red.

But it replays all sounds on front face of cards. And if I only want to listen one of the sounds and click on play button it shows the answer. If I am being picky sorry for that.

You could do this with an option under the answer dropdown for 'mask answers', you would then see the answer by clicking on the space where the answer would be. This would mean that you could quickly scan through the questions looking for any areas you need to quickly go over for a test, or because you are going to a restaurant in the language you are learning, etc. You could do this with a lot more effort by setting by sub groups but this would be fast, painless and effective

		I am new to Anki, and I just figure out how to align left for all the cards. Open desktop version, click on a card in browse, and click &quot;cards&quot;, it will open a window that will have some styling code. In the styling box, change &quot;text-align: center&quot; to &quot;text-align: left&quot;. I am wondering if we could do the same thing on AnkiDroid app. Something like vertically align center. Add a new option for the alignment where users can set it center or left. It would be nice to have this enhancement.

		I have a deck with two card types where every note has exactly two cards. &quot;Bury related new cards until tomorrow&quot; is unchecked. Learning steps are default. The deck is newly added from scheduling-less apkg and hasn't been used before. Anki Desktop behavior: Do 30 new cards in under 10 minutes on fresh deck. Start getting shown previously new cards that are now in the learning phase, on their 10 minute step, before their scheduled moment in time has passed. They're shown in a seemingly random order. Ankidroid behavior: Do the same thing. They're shown in the same order I originally saw them in. Behavior difference is the same after waiting more than 10 minutes to make the cards all be due instead of ahead schedule.

		Import-replace (and by extension, restore from backup) does not work. It results in a corrupt collection where every card is (seemingly) placed in the default deck. Trying to start reviewing results in this error: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'org.json.JSONArray org.json.JSONObject.getJSONArray(java.lang.String)' on a null object reference
 On the upside, at least I now know what is causing these errors that I've seen in Acra. 👍 1

		Sir When we check media sometimes it says for example 10 media used by cards but aren't in media folder or says 10 media are in media folder that aren't used by any cards In these two cases it's highly needed for a creator of a deck to see which is which I mean if I have 900 cards and 10 media aren't in media folder and 20 media aren't used by any cards if I could be able to see which media aren't used and which cards are using missed media it wouldn't be needed to check all these 900 cards to find which card can't play audio Sometimes audio's incorrect name or card's incorrect content caused these two problems If u add a list of these media or these cards that don't have media You simply have removed a burden I just thought u can add this feature in card browsing by adding a tag like other tags or make it visible in another color

So when new rows appear, to add cards. When I edit rows, to also update related cards (or at least add new ones woth new concent and somehow tag/mark old onces as &quot;deprecated&quot;).

		A few seconds after clicking &quot;export&quot; on my laptop, and I get a confirmation message that tells me the number of cards that have successfully exported. However, they don't appear in my Samsung on5 device. A Previous answer to a similar problem on the old Google instructs as follows: export the file to apkg from Anki Desktop, then copy the apkg file to your AnkiDroid folder on your device, and choose import cards from the main menu However, I don't see a &quot;main menu&quot; and when I go to the downloads file, all I see are prepackaged decks. So how can I (complete the) transfer of my custom made Chinese cards from my laptop to my Android (Samsung on5 device?

		Some of my cards show both the front card information (question) as well as the back card info (answer) on the front card. Why is this happening and what can I do to get it to show me simply front card information on the front and back card information on the back? It seems that it is the production cards that are causing the problem (I think). If I deleted them I think I delete them for the whole deck and I don't know if that's a good idea. Any help greatly appreciated. It's driving me crazy.

		On the review of Google Play, an user complained that he can't understand the meaning of the &quot;Custom steps&quot;. To make the function more easy to understand, it seems to be more appropriate to add &quot;(in minutes)&quot; behind &quot;Custom steps&quot;, as &quot;Steps&quot; of &quot;New cards&quot; and &quot;Custom steps&quot; of Anki Desktop do (as follows) &quot;Steps&quot; of &quot;New cards&quot; &quot;Custom steps (in minutes)&quot; on Anki Desktop Moreover, it seem to be better to make another title for the first one of the two &quot;&quot;Custom steps&quot;, say, &quot;Use custom steps&quot;, because the same titles are a bit confusing, and &quot;Custom steps (in minutes)&quot; would not be suitable for the first one.

Expected Result I expect the background music app's audio volume to be lowered immediately before Anki's audio starts playing, and go back to full volume after Anki's audio has finished playing. Actual Result The audio in the Anki flashcard starts playing right away About 0.5s - 1s after that, the background music app's audio lowers About 1s - 2s after that, the background music app's audio goes back to full volume. My understanding is that this behavior is related to Android's &quot;Audio Focus&quot; feature. Would it be possible to ignore the audio focus and play sounds no matter whether a background app is playing music or not ? I'm pretty fond of reviewing my flashcards while listening to music.

		Ankidroid is not handeling the Review Ceiling correctly. Example: There are 500 Cards to be reviewed. The user caps this to 50 Cards per day. The user reviews these 50 cards, he knows them, and all of them should reappear the next day because he clicked on &quot;Good&quot; and it was set to 1 day. BUT the 50 cards do not reappear, instead all other 450 cards appear before the 50 cards during the next few days This is a huge issue for the learning process. I say that the last reviewed card must have priority over the cards that are untouched for weeks or months. (They only appear first because Ankidroid is only checking the Due date of the cards) So if you would wan't to see the 50 cards again, you would need to turn off the Ceiling and click through every card that needs to be reviewed. I believe this is not the purpose of such a ceiling... Please review this as soon as possible because it's an actual flaw

		Research [ x ] I have read the support page and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to AnkiDroid [ x ] I have checked the manual and the FAQ and could not find a solution to my issue [ x ] I have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum Reproduction Steps Open in Study mode a card with a furigana: field Long-press on the field to select some text Tap 'select all' from the bar at the top Tap 'copy' from the same bar Paste the text in another app Expected Result The pasted text contains no furigana. Actual Result The furigana is shown as regular text after its kanji. (The same thing happens if I 'share', instead of copy and paste) I occasionally enter a wrong kanji when creating cards and, later, when studying, I have doubts about it. I'd like to be able to quickly check with a dictionary app whether the word/phrase is actually a valid one. Being able to copy/share it straight from the Study screen would be very handy for that, but since currently the furigana is mixed with the kanji, it has to be cleaned up first. My current work-around for that is to open the Edit Note screen, select all in the field, and copy it. A Tasker task is listening for clipboard changes, and when a new text that matches the \[\p{Hira}+\] regex is copied, the task strips all spaces and furigana annotations. Then I paste it in a dictionary. I can't do such thing straight from Study screen, as furigana is not marked as such, it looks exactly like regular kana that might be part of the word/phrase. It would be nice if furigana is omitted when copying text from Study screen.

		Hoping this is the right place to do a feature request, sorry if it isn't. I'm using AnkiDroid to study vocabulary, and to thin the deck when there is a term I know well I supend the note; I'd love to have a way to check from time to time all the suspended notes, to put back in the deck the ones I don't remember anymore. It there isn't a way to do something like these (I didn't find it), would it be possible to add it?

		Research [ x ] I have read the support page and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to AnkiDroid [ x ] I have checked the manual and the FAQ and could not find a solution to my issue [ x ] I have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum Reproduction Steps Create a media file containing a dollar sign, e.g. Test$Me.mp3 In the desktop Anki, create a deck and a note which contains [sound:Test$Me.mp3] Export the deck, and import the resulting .apkg into AnkiDroid Expected Result The deck should be imported and the media should play. Actual Result The deck is imported and the card created with the media play button, but there is no sound heard. Editing the note shows that the '$' character is not present in the media file name. Adding the '$' again corrects the issue and the media then plays correctly (meaning the media file itself is correctly copied with the '$' in the name; only the note content is altered). The same behavior does not occur when importing into the desktop program. The same behavior does not occur when the deck is created via syncing through an ankiweb account, only when using the Import procedure.

		Currently, if I set &quot;Center align&quot; the bottom content of my cards is commonly covered by the keyboard once activated (Google Handwriting is esp. huge) don't set &quot;Center align&quot; the content has both its top parts hidden behind Anki's top bar once a keyboard activates and is (ofc) too far up. Thus as a compromise I'd like to ask for an option to bias &quot;Center align&quot;. Eg, select a value between -50% and 50% (of app height), with negative values pushing the center up and positive ones pushing it down.

		Hi Now we can share a deck and send it's link to others and put it on other websites that's great But there is a problem! Imagine I share a deck that is English to Persian and I want to put it on ankiWeb Persian to English as well So what should I do? Just to change the templates Till now there is no problem So please consider if after a year I want to edit one of them and add or delete some cards and add pictures or sounds and ... I just edit English to Persian deck and by changing its templates I can make a new deck Persian to English and share them again So the problem begins here I will lose the links that I had put in other places So I wanna say please make a link permanent for a shared deck so we don't have to send new links to other places

Except changing the way of fetching data from one-shot to paging SQL, it may continuously happen.

		Hello I have AnkiDroid on my SamsungA8 phone and I want to transfer 5 decks with 200flashcards to my new Iphone7. How can I do this? Thanks in advance. And another issue. I noticed that Samsung uses Android and the app is called 'AnkiDroid' and is free to download. But now with my Iphone I have to pay about 25 bucks for the app I already have. And the name is different, is called AnkiFlashcards or something but the logo is still the same. Please let me know if I will have any problem and if is the same app. Thanks.

		With Anki 2.6.1 (just updated to 2.7 and have no opportunity to check on new version) if hold on desk select Deck options select New Card select Steps (in minutes) enter 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 20 or similar pattern leave out of all option menus start learning new card After showing card I type Good (1 min), after 1 min I have only choice to type Good (20 min). All equal learning intervals collapsed into single and I am prompted to check next non-equal interval. NOTE Red indicator of card in learning correctly updated after checking Good (20 min). So if I have seven 1 min intervals it decreased by 7 )) New research http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2011_Karpicke_Bauernschmidt_JEPLMC.pdf showed that there is no any improvements with using increasing delays between showing cards (for learning during the day). Only repetition count and total session duration have role (the more is better). I started discussion on this topic at http://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/questions/2344/repetition-interval-during-initial-learning-within-a-day and https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/57zdtu/what_learning_steps_interval_you_used_for/ I try to use divide duration of my typical learning session into equal intervals and trapped to this error. I actually use 5 15 15 15 120 pattern. I should see card 3 times during in my typical 1 hour session and later see it in the evening or next day. But I see it only once. As word-around I set interval pattern to 5 20 15 10 120 which work as expected.

		Issue: I copied Chinese phrases out of a pdf file into Anki (Desktop) and synced with my Ankidroid. In the Ankidroid version, sometimes there are characters missing in the phrase - the whole phrase shows up in the Editing mode for my card, but not in the preview card, in the preview card there is only a space - If I copy that space to somewhere else, it shows me the character... naturally I thought it has something to do with the fonts - I changed fonts and card type - but it did not help - The Desktop Version can handle it normally... but not the Ankidroid Version. Reproduction Steps Download this PDF File 1. Text_Teil1_Masterübersetzung.pdf Copy the first Sentence in Anki, Sync with Ankidroid Check the Preview and the Editing Mode Expected Result: The Preview should exactly show the Sentence I copied Actual Result: A Few Characters are indeed missing.

I understand that this isn't possible in the droid version. Looking at the rich adding media possibilities though, I don't understand why it isn't possible to add a text field as attachment. My experience with language cards is that with any non trivial vocabulary, an example is compulsory for a thorough comprehension. So I'd like to suggest to add an example field by default, or a text field as media attachment. It feels like such a feature must have been asked in the past but I couldn't find a corresponding issue.

                    mCol.getMedia().markClean(Collections.singletonList(fname));
                }
 And I have found the counterpart from anki pc client (sync.py line 775):                 if not ldirty:
                    self.col.log(&quot;delete local&quot;)
                    self.col.media.syncDelete(fname)
                else:
                    # conflict; local add overrides remote delete
                    self.col.log(&quot;conflict; will send&quot;)
            else:
                # deleted both sides
                self.col.log(&quot;both sides deleted&quot;)
                ldirty and self.col.media.markClean([fname])
 AFAIK, if(ldirty != 0) seems to be just the opposite of if not dirty. This makes it is nearly impossible to sync a file deletion to ankidroid (not a big problem, though). Hope you can fix this on next release. Thanks :)

		By using the MessagEase keyboard I fell in principle fast enough to type on my phone to answer cards that need typing. Unfortunately the keyboard doesn't automatically popup when I open a new card with a typing speed. Always having to click on the text field needs time that's unecessary. I would prefer if the text field would get automatically focused and the keyboard would expand.

To replicate the bug you need to have more than one deck grouped in a folder (to get that you only have to put a common prefix and ::, for example language::English and language::Spanish) When you review today's new cards of one of the deck then sometimes all the new cards of the other deck have disappeared in the process of reviewing the first deck. Obviously this have no sense. Did someone ever experience the same? I hope, I had explained it clear. Thank you Debug info Refer to the support page if you are unsure where to get the &quot;debug info&quot;.

		Reproduction Steps I can't reproduce it freely for now, but I saw the bug at least 3 times, and I've never seen it in other situations. I hope this report will be a clue to fix this bug. Tap an notification of a deck reminder. Expected Result A standard study screen is displayed. Its answer button is displayed under the front-side sceen area since I don't change the position setting. &quot;Type answer box&quot; won't be displayed since the deck doesn't have any cards which need typing. Actual Result An odd study screen as follows is displayed. An type answer box is displayed on the app bar. The answer button is above the front-side screen area, in disregard of the position setting. Its frond-side screen area (the area under the answer button) is empty. The answer button size is initialized. After I tap the answer button, the back-side screen won't displayed, the error message, AnkiDroid has encountered a problem; a report is being sent to the developers…, is displayed, and AnkiDroid is closed. @madhead, do you have any idea about this, in relation to #4450?

		onPostExecute() appears to only show syncMessage when a sync fails, which means AnkiWeb has no way to send a message to the user without preventing them from syncing. The behaviour of the other clients when the message is non-empty is to show the message separately, regardless of the sync status. This enables us to give users a warning before an upcoming change (in this case, https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/email-verification), instead of immediately locking them out until they take action. AnkiDroid used to handle this correctly - it looks like it was broken in 82f5a58

		Hi guys, When you have a chance, could you please have future AnkiDroid releases use sync.ankiweb.net? This can shave a few seconds off the sync in some cases by avoiding an extra SSL handshake. The previous endpoints will continue to work for the foreseeable future so we don't break older versions. dae/anki@04bc1a7

I'm so frustrated and tired because it's one week that I'm searching but I can't find any soloution on this issue. please help me I have 2000 cards and it has taken me too much time. phone model: sony m4 aqua the media is playing correctly on Anki Desktop but not on AnkiDroid and the media files exist in my AnkiDroid/collection.media and I see the triangle mark in my card. I test it with another phone with android 6.0 and there was no problem but in my phone with android 6.0.1 the problem exists. do I need to download codecs or something like that? do I need to downgrade to android 5? help please

		On v2.8 or before, a full path is displayed as a filename. On v.2.8.1beta1 and v2.8.1beta2, just a filename is displayed, but the message lacks information of where the file exists. It's incorrect as a filename on v2.8, while it seems insufficient on v2.8beta1. How about adding something like In &quot;(AnkiDroid directory)/export&quot;, to the beginning of the message?

		Separating this from issue 3576. I seem to have a reproducible corruption problem. My repro steps: Modify my collection on my PC in a way that requires a full upload. Sync PC -&gt; AnkiWeb. Sync AnkiWeb -&gt; AnkiDroid Result: AnkiDroid has a problem and sends a report somewhere. I don't think it said anywhere that the collection is corrupted, but it seems to me that it is corrupted because I have well over 150 &quot;old&quot; questions scheduled every day, and after this crash, I had zero &quot;old&quot; questions scheduled. Only some brand new questions showed up. This happened two days (2017-02-12) and yesterday (2017-02-13) and I seem to be able to reproduce this any day now. Before Feb 12, this never happened to me.

		Hi, guys! First of all thanks a lot for such a marvelous app! About my problem, in a word I can't figure out what's actually wrong but it seems like there is a bug in database. I've attached a couple of files. So when I add a new card, for example I type a word 'Pizza' in the first line and when I open up that card I see in the same line 'Pizza шлю'. This junk 'шлю' also appeared in many cards that have been in database for long time and I changed nothing in the ones, but now they all have the same stuff. How do you think what the cause may be in this case? I've tried to look up the data from db2 but some files are encrypted. Anyway thanks in advance! My phone is Meizu MX4 PRO, FLYME 6.0.2.0 OS, Android version 5.1.1

		I'm so happy with the results of an addon I made for Anki Desktop for my study - https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/11767883 It shows the least overdue learning cards first, which is the opposite to the normal behaviour. This is done because when I mark a card &quot;again&quot;, I don't want to see it in 2 minutes or 30 seconds, I want to see it in 3 seconds, or I'll forget it, so I need to ensure old &quot;learning&quot; cards don't pop up before it. I love this change to my study so much, I've been prefering the desktop app over the android, it would be great if I could have the desktop app on my phone. Or even better, can I somehow change the code and have in Ankidroid?

		Feature Request: It would be great if simple drawings could be added to a card in extended mode directly from within Anki. There is code in Anki that allows drawing during testing. This might perhaps be reused also to create cards ? This would really simplify the usage of drawings for learning. Thanks for considering this.

		Hi everyone, I have the following question, is it possible to invert the colors of an image (specifically a gif) when Night Mode is activated in an Android 4.1.2? I've seen the Advanced Formatting but it clearly states that works for versions 4.4+...is there a workaround for my version? Thank you all in advance and best regards. Saul Cuen

		This was invalid notification so I edited it. But I have one remark: I see there is an option: &quot;Fetch media on sync&quot; - By default, AnkiDroid will sync sounds and images as well as your cards and review history. If you disable this option, sounds and images will not be synced by AnkiDroid. I didn't understand what fatch exactly mean. But now I think that you can consider add information to Ankidroid manual that it affect both download and upload. And you can also mention that there is an option for that in Anki desktop https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankiweb/2289-synch-with-ankiweb-excluding-media?unresolve=true This might help other users to better understand manual than I did.

		The wiki page for Database-Structure documents that column 'id' from table 'revlog' is &quot;epoch-seconds timestamp of when you did the review&quot;. Based on my own tinkering and browsing the database with sqlitebrowser it's pretty clear that revlog.id is measured in epoch-milliseconds instead.

		Research I have read the support page and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to AnkiDroid I have checked the manual and the FAQ and could not find a solution to my issue I have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum Scenario I am often learning cards that require some minutes of thinking. When I am done thinking about a card, the phone is usually already locked because of the screen timeout. Of course this can be avoided by increasing the timeout or using the Anki function to never turn off the screen. I have used this option for some time now but I noticed that keeping the screen on reduces battery life while learning quite a lot. Feature request It would be great if there was an option to display Anki on top of the lockscreen - so I can turn off the display while thinking on a card and do not need to enter my password again for the next card.

		I've found a shared deck that has embedded audio, as one can see from inspecting the apkg and previewing the words on the shared deck page. However, after importing into AnkiDroid, the media files have not been copied to the filesystem. I will try to look into this in more detail next time I have some free time after work

Under a &quot;Study targets dashboard&quot; you could create the following study target. Name &quot;Organic Chemistry Exam&quot; Target Date &quot;1/1/18&quot; Days left &quot;x&quot; Current predicted % &quot;34%&quot; &quot;I want to have [70%] of my cards to be &quot;mature&quot; by [1/1/18] when my exam is. I can devote a maximum of [1.5 hours] per day to revise. My study material consists of [399] [pages] (/modules/chapters). To date I have created cards for [4] pages.&quot; &quot;The decks that this applies to is [Organic Chemistry] and all sub-decks&quot; The data contained within this paragraph would let Anki predict how many cards will be created by the end of the study material ((Number of cards to date/4)*399). Using the built in probabilistic prediction algorithm and the % target requirements you could back fit the latest date by which all the study material needs to be converted into cards and so the minimum amount of study material that needs to be converted into cards per day. By using the amount of revision time available per day, user data to date and the prediction algorithm it would allow Anki to limit the number of cards that could be studied per day (for optimal recall you cannot have spikes that would require hours worth of study that is not available, this happens alot to me at the moment). This would mean the cards available to be learned would need to be staggered. You could also warn if 1.5 hours is not sufficient and recommend a new value. This would be useful and make Anki less demoralising and optimised (avoid sub-optimal card spikes where the time simply isn't available to optimally learn the cards).

		The Chrome Web app suddenly stopped working on my Chromebook about a week ago. In an attempt to fix it, I uninstalled the app and tried to reinstall it from the Chrome webstore. The info page on the Chrome Webstore states that the file size is 3.58MB, and I remember that previous installations were rather small. Now, however, the download appears to be over 100MB. As this seems weird behaviour, I cancelled the download at that point because I don't want to accidentally install something that may harm my machine. (My Chromebook does not support android apps, which is why the Chrome app was so useful for me). Please check that the webstore package is working correctly and malware free.

		in the previous versions of ankidroid (i mean version 2.3) to import an apkg file we placed it in the phone memory card and by clicking on it, it started to import because the spkg file was recognized by ankidroid. but in the new versions by clicking on a apkg file the message &quot;application not available ' appears which means that the apkg file is not recognized by ankidroid and we should put the apkg file in ankidroid folder and then import it. since clicking on apkg to import it is very good option can you apply this again in new versions?

Put Android into multi-window mode (long-press on the multitasking button on my system). Observe how some texts change language (e.g. the text in the top bar). Expected Result The UI language should not change when AnkiDroid is in multi-window mode. Actual Result The UI language changes when AnkiDroid is in multi-window mode. (Only some texts (e.g. the text in the top bar) change, but not others like the text at the bottom (&quot;Studied X cards in Y minutes today&quot;)) When AnkiDroid is put back into single-window mode, only some texts change back to the correct language. In my case, this lead to the buttons that are shown on the bottom of the screen during review being displayed in different languages. Screenshot taken after switching to multi-window mode and back to single-window mode again: (As you can see, some parts of the UI are Japanese (system language) and some are English (language set in AnkiDroid settings).)

		The Advanced Statistics setting (&quot;Predictive Forecast&quot;) gives an incorrect &quot;Study&quot; count per day when you have subdecks. The algorithm should take into account that a max new cards setting for a deck is a global maximum for all of the subdecks. For example, if I have a parent deck with a setting of max 20 new cards and two subdecks with a setting of 20 each, it will display as 60 cards due every day. This is incorrect, and the user would never see more than 20 on any given day due to the limit set by the parent decks setting. Steps to reproduce: Enable &quot;Advanced Statistics&quot; Create a new deck &quot;Foo&quot; with 20 new cards (make sure max new cards setting is 20) Create a new subdeck &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; with 20 new cards (make sure max new cards setting is 20) Go to the &quot;Statistics&quot; / &quot;Forecast&quot; screen Behaviour: The diagram shows 40 cards as being due today, and none tomorrow. Expected behaviour: The diagram shows 20 cards as being due today, and 20 tomorrow.

Sync ankidroid Expected Result An error message as soon as the error can be detected, before the full download I.e. since you know that there may be an error when there are too many note type, download this first. While the remaining is downloading, check whether the string is too long. If it is the case, abort the downloading. I imagine that this would probably not help a lot of people. Let me explain how it would help me. Since there is no way to know, in advance, whether the string's size problem will occur or note, I need to try to sync to see whether I successfully solved. the problem Each sync cost 50mb of bandwidth each time. This is costly, and takes time. At least in my case, it would be really helpful, because each time I try to download again, I have to download 50MB, before I finally see that the sync led to something I can't use. Actual Result The database is fully downloaded before the error message is shown. Debug info I can't access Debug Info while having this error message.

		I do not see an option for changing the color of cloze text when Night Mode is enabled. It appears there is some default color of blue that overrules whatever the cloze color the card CSS says. If this overrulling color could be removed or if there could be an option for changing the color, that would be appreciate.

(I know I can select to see just leech cards, but I'd like to be able to have some highlight on that regard also during normal study.)

Either that, or an option to choose the time of day to cycle cards would be nice.

		I have followed all recommended research steps, and simply elided them for a more concise report Reproduction: git fork / clone / build / run on emulator that has never run ankidroid before (master/HEAD as of time of this bug report) AnkiDroid crashes on startup Useful(?) portion of stack trace: E/CollectionHelper: Could not initialize AnkiDroid directory com.ichi2.anki.exception.StorageAccessException: No write access to AnkiDroid directory at com.ichi2.anki.CollectionHelper.initializeAnkiDroidDirectory(CollectionHelper.java:175) at com.ichi2.anki.CollectionHelper.getCol(CollectionHelper.java:91) at com.ichi2.anki.services.BootService.scheduleDeckReminder(BootService.java:47) at com.ichi2.anki.services.BootService.onHandleIntent(BootService.java:39) at android.app.IntentService$ServiceHandler.handleMessage(IntentService.java:66) Workaround: If you manually go into Android settings for the app and grant permissions, it works Thoughts: On first inspection I was unable to see where AnkiDroid asks for permission in the code. Either way, on first startup it seems it should attempt to ask the user if it may have the permissions it needs, and if it doesn't have them it should give a nice error message prior to closing rather than a crash. You can reproduce this easily on a device that has AnkiDroid already by doing the parallel build process (but it appears with a clean local build as well!) Please tell me if I'm just missing something obvious, otherwise, I could also accept nudges towards how to implement a permission-request-on-first-run plus a graceful-message-then-close thing

This only happens if it is the last letter of a word and doesn't always occur. I believe in some dialects of Arabic (e.g. Egyptian) &quot;yaa&quot; is often written as &quot;alif maqsura&quot; - so not sure if this is machine behavior trying to compensate. This is not correct behavior in formal Arabic. It may appear as &quot;alif maqsura&quot; on the answer card even if the answer is written as &quot;yaa&quot; (see pictures). Link - https://imgur.com/a/A2qoU You can see that the answer appears differently from how it has been inputted in the &quot;edit note&quot;, namely it is missing two dots below the final character. Expected Result If answer is written as &quot;yaa&quot; it should always appear as &quot;yaa&quot;. Actual Result Debug info Refer to the support page if you are unsure where to get the &quot;debug info&quot;.

		Hi. I'm verry glad to use an automatic display answer function but I have a problem with it :( After showing the answer without choose any option like&quot;AGAIN&quot; or &quot;HARD&quot; or &quot;GOOD&quot; or &quot;EASY&quot; the AnkiMobile always choose AGAIN as a default choose. It is useless for me due to save my time I have to learn during my housework. If or Where can I change default behaviour for automatic display answering without touching a mobilephone screen ? For instance I want to change default behaviour after displayed the answer from AGAIN to &quot;GOOD&quot; during my dishwashing :) or car maintenance . I often got wet or dirty fingers and I will break my phone by choosing a GOOD as a answer.

		When creating a deck from an existing one, selecting the by tag option, it would be nice if when adding a new card with this tag, it was also added to the deck. If I am not wrong, currently the number of cards in this deck is never increased. I think it is not possible to configure this at the moment, if not please let me know how. 😉

		I have a deck of Japanese with cards Kanji → Meaning, Kanji → Reading, Meaning → Reading and Meaning → Kanji. I've noticed I reviewed new cards (not in random order) much much faster than I do review cards. I think one of the reasons is that new cards are (by the burying mechanism) almost always sorted by card type: first the Meaning → Reading cards, then the Kanji → Reading cards, etc. This causes less “context switches”, and the brain concentrates more on the vocabulary and less on “on what language is it? what was the answer I am expected to give?” So I was thinking it may be a good idea to be able to sort review cards based on card type, grouping cards of the same type in the reviews. What do you think about it? (I'll open the same issue on anki-desktop's repo based on the outcome of this discussion, as I'm mostly using ankidroid for reviews)

		I searched for this issue and I did not find it. In Anki Desktop I created a deck like this: Master - set to show 10 new cards daily Master::A - set to show 2 new cards daily (different option set) Master::B - set to show 10 new cards daily (same option set of Master deck) In Anki desktop and AnkiWeb, if I study the Master deck, I am presented with 2 new cards from Master::A and 8 new cards from Master::B In Ankidroid, instead, if I study the Master deck, I am presented with 10 new cards from Master::A and 0 new cards from Master::B. This is not correct, as the Master::A deck has a 2 new cards limit.

		Hello everybody, I'm a Chinese user of Anki android version, I have an issue with TTS, I use Anki to memorize English vocabulary, I have installed google TTS for making the Anki can pronounce the word when I memorize the words. After I set the Google TTS as the main TTS engine It works, but it doesn't work very well. When I restart to use Anki, There is a message show in the Anki, &quot;No text-to-speech language available&quot;, all I have to do is that to set Google TTS as the main TTS engine again, and after that the problem will come back again after several minutes, so I have to do the setting again and again. Is there anyone has the same problem as mine? what should I do to solve the problem? many thanks

		Research Enter an [ x ] character to confirm the points below: [ x ] I have read the support page and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to AnkiDroid [ x ] I have checked the manual and the FAQ and could not find a solution to my issue [ x ] I have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum Reproduction Steps Hello!, I'm new on Android development. I'm trying to use the AnkiDroid API in a personal project based on the sample provided at: https://github.com/ankidroid/apisample The API is working fine except for the findDuplicateNotes function. I'm trying to detect all duplicates I have stored in a file but it is not detecting all the duplicates. In a list of 2000 cards, it finds approximately 1100 duplicates (the remaining 900 are not detected even if they are already in the deck). I have been trying to debug my project (based on the sample) and debugging also the Anki-Android APP, and as far as I have been able to understand, the problem seems related to a hashcode calculation that was already solved in this commit: 269fd17 In fact, I have seen the source code of the latest version of the API that I'm referencing: https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/ichi2/anki/api/1.1.0alpha5/ And I see that the affected files are not updated... I think that publishing the current version of the API should solve the problem ¿Can you please update the published API? In case it is not possible, ¿Could you suggest any workaround to use the latest version of the API in my project or how to point to the git version in the gradle file? (I have been trying to build the current version of the API to a JAR in my machine and then reference it in my project, but by the moment I was unable to make it work... I think I need to understand better the dependencies and build system in order to do this.. :)) Expected Result When searching a duplicated card the key &quot;熊, くま&quot; (for example) it should find 1 result in my deck (since I have already added this card) Actual Result The card is not detected as duplicated and I can add it over and over again Debug info AnkiDroid Version = Any (the problem is with the API) AnkiDroid API Version = 1.1.0alpha5 Android Version = 7.0.0 Key searched for duplicates: &quot;熊, くま&quot; Wrong hashcode obtained by the published 1.1.0alpha5 version of the API: 4081968894 Right hashcode obtained by the latest version of the AP in github: 255123055 (which seems it should work)

		It may be possible (or it may already be partially/mostly implemented) to have code style conventions shared from the project into Android Studio by default I will look into the current code style settings and how they are shared, and make sure this is operating correctly Discussion from browser multiselect PR #4839 here: e3d9d63#commitcomment-29350498
