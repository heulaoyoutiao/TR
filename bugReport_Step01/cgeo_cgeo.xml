		With the change of developers we must update about-information: Although Carnero made the most of the code, he isn't the main developer anymore. In my oppinion we should remove the entry &quot;author&quot; and list him (at the top) and all other developers under &quot;contributors&quot;. Also &quot;powered_by&quot; =&quot; Carnero&quot; should be replaced with a more generic term, such as &quot;geocachers of the world&quot; (I'm open to other suggestions. :D )

		From Facebook: It looks like opensource c:geo does not work on Android 1.5. This issue and many others will be fixed in next few weeks. July 9 at 3:56am Any updates on this yet?? Those of us stuck with Android 1.5 phones due to the manufacturers not updating the version are patiently waiting! I have a Motorola i1, and that phone is only 3 months old and stuck forever on Android 1.5 so it can support the iDEN Direct Connect network. Carnero and the official app have always supported down to 1.5, so i hope the opensource version continues as you have stated you would.

		By default, I have c:geo hide found caches. There is a recently introduced bug which causes this to work sporadically. In some cases, previously foudn caches are displayed. When zooming in/out, sometime previously foudn caches will appear/disappear. The problem is intermittent - sorry I cannot provide more concrete details.

		When viewing the list of saved caches and clicking view map, the map view loads non-saved caches. To reproduce: Save a few caches. From the main menu click &quot;Stored&quot; Click the map icon on the upper edge. The map now contains caches that are not in the stored cache list.

		In map view (both live map, map of stored caches and map of individual caches) all cache icons disappear if the zoom level is low enough. The caches appear at first, but disappear once the search indicator in the upper right hand corner disappears. This could make sense in live map, where one does not want to load every cache in the whole world if one zooms out to view the entire world, but this is not what's going on here, as it also affects the stored cache and individual cache maps, and caches that are already loaded also disappear.

		When using the live map, caches that I own or have already found appear in the map, even though I have opted to hide them. Steps to reproduce: In the settings, select &quot;Exclude own and found caches&quot;. From the main menu, select &quot;Live map&quot;. Disable follow position (optional). Scroll to an area where you have found or own caches. What should happen: Caches you own or have found should not appear. What does happen: All caches, including caches you have found or own, appear. After loading is complete, the found and owned caches disappear. If the map is moved (triggering a new search) the caches temporarily re-appear.

		GPS accuracy on some android devices can be improved a lot by dampening GPS coordinates. the free app &quot;GPS status&quot; by EclipSim allows four levels of filtering, none, weak, medium, strong. When switching from weak to medium on my Galaxy S I9000, the GPS accuracy improved considerably. The downside is that it takes longer to react. But when navigating only a few meters in search for a cache, I prefer accuracy over speed. Maybe it would even be possible to use GPS Status / Radar to navigate to caches in addition to the builtin compass?

		When the user deletes all caches of the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list, the caches are deleted from the database BUT they remain in the list view until the user exits the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list and the re-enters the &quot;Stored caches&quot; list afterwards. This is confusing most of the users (including myself). Steps to reproduce : import any gpx file via Stored / Import GPX (e.g. 93 caches are added in the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list) Select Manage/Drop All to remove all caches out of the list (deletion proceeds) .... after deletion: The list of caches (in my case 93) can still be seen in the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list [BUG] For my understandig the list of caches shall be empty after a &quot;delete all caches&quot; command.

		It's very cumbersome to change the api-key in values/strings.xml for every build and undo it (so nothing is changed in the repository). It should be possible with Ant, but I never worked with it before and I don't know if there's a way without copy/replace the complete file (because it's impossible to create a template for strings.xml, maybe with a patch-task in combination with copy/filterset?). Maybe one of you can help with this. Some links: http://www.androidengineer.com/2010/06/using-ant-to-automate-building-android.html http://blog.cuttleworks.com/2011/02/android-dev-prod-builds/ http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/patch.html My idea: Use copy/filterset-task to generate a patch-file from template with new api-key from debug.properties / release.properties Use patch-task to apply the generated patch-file to values/strings.xml Is there an easier way or should we move the key to a separate configuration file (like in the second link, but this would result in changes in the code)?

		Sometimes we solve more than 1 cache at the same time. So we have to switch from GCx to GCy very often. Currently we have to keep the GC-numbers in mind. It would be nice to have a list of recent searched geocaches or the possibility to open cgeo twice. Or maybe use tabs / split the screen / ... ??

		First and foremost: I don't want to introduce any unnecessary formalism. And I strongly believe in &quot;Release early, release often&quot;. Nevertheless I wanted to ask if we are going to have some kind of planned (or expected) releases. For instance last week a new release was created on Friday, so that all cachers would be able to use the new version over the weekend. I'm mainly asking because I refactored all the code relating to calling external applications (navigation, maps, ...) which led to a lot of changes. And I just want to know when will be a good time to release large changes (which may introduce new bugs, even if you do a lot of testing beforehand). Currently I will hold back my changes until the weekend is nearly over, assuming that releasing on Sunday evening will have the smallest impact, if any bugs slipped through. BTW: Would something like this better be discussed in the wiki? I have never worked with GitHubs wiki before.

		Hi, it happens quite offten to me that c:geo crashes when loading details of the cache. I use c:geo 2.25 on HTC Wildfire with Android 2.2.1. It doesn't matter if it is from map or searchlist or nearby list. After selecting/taping to the cache to display its details, sometimes it happens that it displays the splash screen &quot;Loading the cache details&quot; and then after some time the phone displays an errormessage and goes back to the map/list.

		Hi, I use HTC Wildfire which is not a fast smartphone and when I tap on the map icon in main menu nothing happens for a while. It takes some 5 seconds for the c:geo to change the screen to something else than the main menu. It would be very helpful if the icon blinked or somehow reacted and the splash screen &quot;Loading map&quot; appeared. Otherwise it seems that it doesn't work and at the beginning it made me tap several times on the icon. The same would be fine also for the other icons. The reaction time with them is not so bad, but at least a blink would help too.

		Opening a trackable c:geo only shows the &quot;goal&quot;, &quot;about&quot; and the photo but not the last logs. In my opinion this feature would be helpful for the user (e.g. to look where the TB has already been in the past, etc.)

		From facebook: George Markusic I would like to say that I am so happy that someone picked up the support of this application. The only issue I have since the change is my signature. Now when I try to log cache it automatically loads my signature first. I always enjoy putting in a story of my adventure first then add my signature to the bottom. Is it possible to add a feature in a future release where it is an option to have the signature automatically load or you can add it when you want like in the older version. I'll add this functionality.

		The direction of the blue arrow is wrong, if you hold your device in landscape mode. I know that c:geo does not support different layouts. What I mean is a different problem: If you are walking with your device held normally, the arrow will show the right direction. If you continue walking the same direction but start rotating the device, then the arrow on the map rotates, although the map doesn't rotate and you walk the same direction.

		This is similar to issue #66 but I'm logging this separately as this is about visually disabling the nearby button as long as there is the GPSr either switched off or there is no fix. In fact, the button is currently already disabled, yet there is no visual clue to the user. As a possible visual clue I would like to suggest to cross out the button instead of grayingit as this should be more visible even in bad lighting conditions. For instance, it could be crossed out in red.

		This issue applies to version 2.26RC3. The new (or old, depending on your point of view) cache information dialog provides quick access to the compass, but not to the help manual. In contrast, the cache info screen (activity) we had before provided access to the manual. Please add a &quot;?&quot; action button to the cache info dialog. The corresponding manual topic is &quot;c:geo-cache-info&quot;.

		On a completely new device I just had an exception caused by a null map file name. This name is then used by mapforge to verify it as a valid file name. I was able to work around that issue with commit bf92bf3. Nevertheless someone with more experience in the map code should verify that the default value null for the map file name doesn't cause other problems, as I don't really know the remaining map code. From the commit history it looks like a user &quot;Rainer&quot; added the mapsforge implementation, but I don't find an assignee with that username.

		I'm not sure if something can be easily done about this. It's not a big deal, but I figured I'd toss it out there. The new feature to make trackables visited in the setup is wonderful, however, when logging a Will attend, DNF, write note, etc, it still visits all the trackables. I'm sure most folk only visit their trackables on a found log. Is it possible to revert the trackables to do nothing when the log type is changed? If not, it's no big deal. Since 99% of my logs are found it, it's not anything major to have to manually change it on the few other logs. Thanks!

		Especially for Mystery and Multicaches the listings sometimes contain waypoints without coordinates. When I find out the coordinates for the stages/finals I modify the waypoints in c:geo (I enter the coordinates and I add some variable values, ... to the waypoint description). But when I refresh the data in c:geo, my modifications are LOST !!! :-( IMO nothing entered by the user should ever get lost: Not by Refresh, not by GPX import not by anything else. IMO these modifications should even be stored independently of whether the cache itself ist stored for offline use or not.

		When a user goes through the new field now export feature in cgeo in order to upload her or his logs there is an important difference to the existing online log function. In the latter case, cgeo automatically clears a saved log after it has been commuted to gc.com. In the case of export there is no automatic clearing. In consequence, cgeo will reexport old log entries with the next export. While gc.com will sort old entries based on date, the export files will grow as will the internal database. I would like to suggest that the user can clear saved logs from the history or the stored lists. But maybe someone other has a better idea?

		The GUID of newly stored caches is not parsed correctly. For me that led to the effect that &quot;old&quot; caches could be voted (GCvote.com) in the app, while new caches could not be voted. Maybe some other features are effected by the missing guids too.

		It is not at all reproducible, but it now happend the fourth time while logging a cache: After selecting &quot;Besuch loggen&quot; the signature is autoinserted correctly. While I am typing the log-text the app suddenly does not react for some seconds and without doing anything automatically inserts the signature again multiple times (as far as I remember always five times) into the text-field. In my signature I am using [NUMBER] [DATE] and [TIME] fields and my signature starts with a line feed (this is to have space to insert my own text in front of the signature). Maybe one of these is causing the problem. Device: Samsung Galaxy SII with Gingerbread 2.3.3.

		Email request. I really like Your app. It has made me put my old etrex on the shelf. I have a suggestion to make. When I am outdoors and try to look at the logs of a cache to see if it was found reacently it is impossible to see the dates of the logs. The colour is light grey ( i think) and it does not work out in the sun. The rest of the log is in white. Could you please change all of the log to white (or make it configurable) ? Please comment but I don't see any problem why it should not be white?

		Please add option for creating an empty cache to the offline database. This way a not c:geo downloaded cache could be managed by c:geo - like waypoint navigation etc For me this use case occurs from time to time: No network access for mobile thus no offline download possible, but hotel lobby provides inet with printing - thus paper-caching ... Non-geocaching.com listed caches - either from opencaching or (like in Konstanz/Germany) tourism caches. The workaround is to edit any other cache and remember which one it was ;-) Bad Idea if I decided to clean the offlined caches before starting trip to new region.... Comments? Best regards - Henning

		(Add an option to) automatically store cache for offline use, if anything was changed by the user manually. From time to time I start with a cache just from the live map - and start editing/adding waypoints etc. hitting the back button once too often means to &quot;loose&quot; cache-details. Well actually my added information seems to be stored locally since after finding the cache again all manual added data is back within the description... For this scenario, if a user obviously is doing a cache since data is added: Please store all retrieved data locally - murphy defines that no network is available if cache description is left ;-) Comments? Best regards - Henning

		I noticed that it sometimes takes a while to finish when you click &quot;Store&quot; in the cache overview. Maybe the cache information is downloaded/processed again? Shouldn't it be more efficient to just use the available data from the view? But again, I maybe totally wrong here. PS: Bananeweizen seconded that there might be a possibnle issue: &quot;Please create a separate issue, I think you are right in that the cache is parsed two times.&quot;

		I just installed the nightly build 2011.08.10 and have seen the following: In contrast to the older versions the name of the currently opened list of saved caches, the name is no longer shown above the caches. So the user does not have a possibility to see which list is currently shown. It only shows &quot;c:geo&quot;. I would appreciate to make it like before...the list-name to be shown on top.

		What can be done with send-to-c:geo that could not be done with chrome-to-phone (or fox-to-phone for Firefox users)? I ask because I'm a firm believer in &quot;remove code as much as you can to get a maintainable application&quot; and am under the impression that it duplicates the functionality in a less general way (chrome-to-phone uses push notifications). The only difference I see is that people do have to have a Google account to use chrome-to-phone, but I bet this is the case for 99,9% of our Android users.

		Huh? I just tried C:geo extensively. I found 4 caches, and did not find 2. I logged through c:geo on site. In other words, right after the find (or not) I logged in C:geo, and sent the log. The logging order should be 1: @ 14:10 2: @ 14:45 3: @ 14:55 4: @ 15:25 5: @ 15:35 6: @ 15:45 yet in actuallity the logs are sorted like so: 1: @ 14:45 (found) 2: @ 15:25 (not found) 3: @ 15:35 (found) 4: @ 15:45 (not found) 5: @ 14:10 (found) 6: @ 14:55 (found) (going UP in recent logs). It is as if c:geo &quot;held on&quot; to my logs before sending them? Any clues how this could happen? It is frustrating like H*l when you do multiple searches / finds / not founds in a day.

		Hi, It would be nice if we could update the coordinates for enigme caches, and then have them display in a different color (say green) once we resolve them and input the real coordinate to look for the cache. Either we update the initial data or there is a new field use to enter the coordinates found. That sounds reasonable?

		If you use a filter from the options menu in the cache list activity and select one the caches for showing its details, and then return to the list, your filter is gone. I would expect that the filter stays active until I return to the home screen of c:geo (because the order stays the same until you completely leave the list view).

		Okay, no one else came up with this so far: gc.com sends pocket queries as zip files. Some other woops, such as Locus and GeOrg already directly import zipped gpx files. They register appropriate intents, so importing pocket queries is just a matter of taping on the attachment in your mail client or tapping on the download link on the pocket queries page on gc.com. It would simplify usability quite a lot if c:geo would also support direct import of zip files with gpx data.

When selecting the &quot;back-key&quot; (on my Galaxy SII) I am going back to the cache-detail page but not to the TB-list.

Cannnot be corrected by updating cache data from gc.com - icon will then be hidden from map but details view is not updated. Cache had been correctly stored in DB before update. Version: latest market version Language (c:geo and gc.com): german

		While the map is not centered on your current location, show a cross hair in the center of the map. As soon as the x-hair is positioned over a cache icon, the cache name pops up and closes as soon as the x-hair is moved away. As reference, this feature is available in Locus and proves to be quiet useful to &quot;detect&quot; a specific cache, because its much quicker than to open the caches quick info. The cache name pop-up shouldn't be too intrusive (apply semi-transparency or something). EDIT: This should probably be an option.

		Using 2.26 RC3, Android 2.3.4 Motorola (Sprint) Photon. Caches are not displayed on the map for &quot;Nearby&quot; caches. Single caches ARE shown in &quot;Live Map&quot; and &quot;Navigate To&quot; map modes. Looks to be the same bug in issue #67 that was closed except force stop of c:geo doesn't fix it nor does panning/zooming.

		Hi, it happens quite offten to me that c:geo crashes when loading details of the cache. I reported this about c:geo 2.25, but it is the same with c:geo opensource 2.26 R3. I use HTC Wildfire with Android 2.2.1. It doesn't matter if I chose to display cache details from map or searchlist or nearby list. After selecting/taping to the cache to display its details, sometimes it happens that it displays the splash screen &quot;Loading the cache details&quot; and then after some time the phone displays an errormessage and goes back to the map/list. When I try to display the same cache details again afterwards, it loads with no problem. Lack of memory? Timeout? (HTC Wildfire is quite slow and low memory device and the signal was not so good.) In addition I have to report that c:geo crashes now more often also while moving through a map. (Actually, I must say that after last week of hard geocaching during my vacation I got very upset about restarting c:geo all the time because of crashing, not loading maps, not loading caches, not loading cache details, displaying all caches on wrong coordinates, etc.). :( I know you are mostly doing this for free and thank you for the job, and I will just pray that you manage to fix all this asap.)

		Hi, during last week we experienced several times that cache target location was wrong by 20-30 metres (both showing by compass and displaying on live satelite map). After restarting c:geo, all cache icons on map &quot;jumped&quot; for some small distance and the location of the particular cache started pointing to the correct place. This is actually quite nasty - for the first time we had spent some desperate hour searching in deep forest on totally wrong place. Luckily c:geo crashed after some time and afterwards loaded the location correctly. But sometimes even restart didn't help, so we rather used both phones to check if one of them wasn't in this bug (and sometimes they were - both phones showing the same caches but on different places on a map). It was happening to me and my husband with c:geo opensource 2.26 R3 on HTC Wildfire with Android 2.2.1 and Samsung Galaxy S2 with Android 2.3 Gingerbread.

		Hi, on a longer walk I often put the phone to standby (to save battery and to prevent from unwanted tap) with the active map displayed in c:geo. After wakeup c:geo jumps with my current location on map for some 1,5 km. It usually displays only the blue pointer on a blank map and then after some 10 seconds it jumps back to the correct location. Is this necessary? It happens all the time and gets quite annoying. :( (I am sure you already know that I use c:geo opensource 2.26 R3 on HTC Wildfire with Android 2.2.1)

		On facebook they report a problem that c:geo says that log is posted succesfuly but it does not show on GC.com Another problem is that c:geo reports log not sent, but log is actually sent (multiple) times. Please someone check this. (Maybe even before other issues) See also #139, #216.

		I have reproducibly the following issue on version 15.08.2011: When I use OSM:mapnik in &quot;Live Map&quot; and drive around I see that the trail (Spur) gets disaligned. Example: I drive along a windy road and the trail follows the road at first but after the next turn the trail from some minutes ago seems to drift away from the road. It looks like the trail is averaging to become a straight line from trail start to current position as longer as I use it. However it is not fixed to the position I was some minutes ago. On GM it is OK, I do only see this with OSM.

		I was just doing some testing and I discovered that every time I attempt to log a cache that is stored in one of my lists, I receive a notice that says it appears my log failed to upload to geocaching.com. In truth, the log did go though. Upon dropping the cache from the list, the log publishes flawlessly. I tested this on several caches and got the same results.

		Is there a plan for a &quot;Solved Mysteries&quot; function ? It would be nice, if you could add a waypoint, and mark it as Final Location, and then when you use Live Map or Nearby caches, it would pop up using the final coordiantes instead of the original. I have coordinates for 100's of solved mysteries, because I never know when I am near them, as it is often that the distance between original coordinates and solved coordinates are to far.

		Hi! When trying to see the compass, I'm always getting the message &quot;This cache has no coordinates&quot;. I have an account on geocaching. Going on the site, I can see the coordinates for a given geocache, but on my phone, I keep seeing always the same message. The error occurs, for example, for the geocache code GC14VBX. cgeo version is 22605 I'm running android 2.1-update1 My Phone is a ZTE, kernel version 2.6.29 Phone region is Portugal Thanks, Joao Faneca

		The crawler spends one third of its time during a &quot;nearby&quot; search on downloading direction images like this one http://www.geocaching.com/ImgGen/seek/CacheDir.ashx?k=CGQN%0a%01%08%5bQR%5c%5eRA. The seem to be meant to replace the direction arrow in the cache list in strange cases where the cache coordinates are not known. Has anyone ever seen such an arrow in his cache list? I don't think we need them and would therefore like to remove th ecode to download those images.

		Large portions of code are duplicated (ctrl-c/ctrl-v). For example, cgeo.geocaching.cgBase.requestJSONgc(String, String, String) and cgeo.geocaching.cgBase.request(boolean, String, String, String, String, int, Boolean) share a lot of similarities. Duplicate code is (of course) hard to maintain so unwanted (harder to fix bugs and harder to optimize code, cause you have to implement changes twice - or more) Solution: move duplicate to separate methods (extra gain - makes code easier to read (if method names are chosen right))

 The same problem was fixed in c58671a for cgeomap. The big question: Why do we have the same code in two files?! I think we have to refactor a bit. And we must look, why detailProgress can be 0. It works in debugging with a breakpoint, maybe because I'm not as fast as the CPU with clicking on &quot;Resume&quot;. ;)

While caching or debugging, it happens very often to me that I close the application completely (not via home button, but using the back button) and on next start it takes some time to re-find the cache.

		When c:geo is started and there is internet connection a NOTE DISPLAY has to be enabled. It will call some &quot;low tech API&quot; on our webpage (api.cgeo.org) and it would get a data back. Something like none to display no note or a note text (with possible date limit to reduce calls or to display note while offline). Example of usage: NOTE: Dates on log are missing due to GC.com change. We will fix it as soon as possible. Thank you. I answered about 50 emails in past 2 days why there are no dates on logs....

We're using the Android-Log-class (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html, which is ok), but with methods with a signature like (String, String). There are also methods with (String, String, Throwable) that prints out a stack-trace (needs more resources than only an error-message, I think). Alternatively we can use our own Logging-class, that uses a debug-flag (one compiled and one in settings, so you can override the compiled option). Here is a short draft: public class Logger
{
    private Logger() {}

    public static void log(final int priority, final String msg, final Throwable tr)
    {
        if (globalDebugFlag || settingsDebugFlag)
        {
            // &quot;cgeo&quot; instead of &quot;cgSettings.tag&quot;
            Log.println(priority, &quot;cgeo&quot;, msg + &quot;\n&quot; + Log.getStackTraceString(tr));
        }
    }

    public static void v(final String msg, final Throwable tr)
    {
        log(Log.VERBOSE, msg, tr);
    }

    // ...
    // all methods also without Throwable
}

		Each time I try to load cache details from the &quot;live map&quot; it hangs just showing the spinner. I have waited for an hour for it to load to no avail. When I try to load &quot;nearby&quot; it takes about 20 minutes to list the caches then hangs if you try to select one. When I tried to view details while using 3g it seemed to be causing signal loss. I am using android 2.2.2 on the samsung galaxy prevail.

		After getting the app to load the local caches, I attempted to download all the caches to the local device because 3g down here leaves a lot to be desired. Attempted it on wifi and 4g as well. Samsung Epic 4G running 2.2. App also hangs a lot when tapping on a cache to load the details. (Willing to test beta versions if available)

		I upgraded to the latest version of c:geo today. Since then, I cannot load cache details. The time is currently 1:00 am EDT and the problem is not GS server load - I am able to quickly browse the site. On c:geo, I checked my login, was able to view live map, and was able to be nearby - all worked properly. The only thing that is not working is cache details. Please fix.

		When I tried to send Log Visit for one cache I got error message: C:geo could not send log. So I tried this several times and it ends always similarly. Finaly I look at the cache log and saw ten times my visit log!!! Is it possible to avoid creation of send/write Log Visit of founded cache repeatedly from one user (check if user has already sent a Log Visit?

		To manage items in our custom lists, you need to open lists in listview mode. If you want to sort items / list through map or after a search, you cannot do it. Please add a row with the list name, if there, into the cache details and add a menu into this cache screen to move to other list (like it already exists on long press in listview). Thanks

		To reproduce it: Store a cache for offline use Open default-list Menu -&gt; Manage -&gt; Drop all List is empty Open cache again (search, nearby list) You have two options in detail-view: refresh and delete What I expect: The cache is not only removed from list, but also from memory (at least as stored offline, can stay in cache until it is deleted from our garbage collector). There's another issue ralated to this: After dropping all caches the database-size isn't decreased. I explained it with that it is not possible to reduce pagesize in WAL-mode, but I had also no success after changed it to another logging-mode and run VACUUM. See issue #212.

		Hi, The &quot;import from web&quot; feature worked nicely on my Nexus S just once. On the next start of c:geo-opensource, the &quot;Import&quot; button does not show up anymore (which previously opened up a menu where I could choose to import from web or from GPX). Instead of the &quot;Import&quot; button, only the &quot;Import from GPX&quot; button is there. I don't know what could have caused this... Thanks, Enze

		Hi. When switching from old c:geo to c:geo opensource, I did a backup/restore of my data. For lots of those caches (Mystery Finals mainly) i stored POIs in Locus. As you may know, Locus provides an POI option to directly switch back to the c:geo cache details after a POI has been created from &quot;c:geo-&gt;Show on Map-&gt;Locus&quot;. This is working for new stored caches, but not with the ones that have been imported. Locus even throws an exception. The last entry from the stack trace reads: &quot;ActivityNotFoundException: Unable to find explicit activity class {carnero.cgeo/carnero.cgeo.cgeodetail}; have you declared this activity in your AndroidManifest.xml?&quot; Any idea why this isn't working? Did Locus have some kind of old reference thats not working after re-import of the caches? Or isn't c:geo opensource accepting the &quot;old&quot; references at all? Incompatible? TIA, Rev

		I was just using cgeo with logcat enabled, and noticed this warning: W/Database( 1101): Reached MAX size for compiled-sql statement cache for database /data/data/cgeo.geocaching/databases/data; i.e., NO space for this sql statement in cache: SELECT _id, geocode, updated, type, prefix, lookup, name, latlon, latitude_string, longitude_string, latitude, longitude, note FROM cg_waypoints WHERE geocode = &quot;GC1M3C8&quot; LIMIT 100. Please change your sql statements to use '?' for bindargs, instead of using actual values Probably nothing serious, but I guess using parametrized queries is considered good practice wit databases. See paremeter selectionArgs in query() doc.

		From facebook I am suffering from crashes with the latest version from 26.08.2011, didn't have the issue with the previous version. After idling at the map, my HTC Sensation goes to sleep. When I wake the device from sleep and open the lockscreen, it does not bring me back to the map, but instead arrives at the main menu of c:geo. When I click the Live map from the main menu, the app crashes. And here is a log from logcollector from my Desire. I experienced similar behaviour: 08-28 07:02:35.423 E/c:geo (15064): cgMapOverlay.createItem: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 90, size is 7 08-28 07:02:35.423 W/dalvikvm(15064): threadid=14: thread exiting with uncaught exception (group=0x400259f8) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): FATAL EXCEPTION: Thread-41 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): java.lang.NullPointerException 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at com.google.android.maps.ItemizedOverlay.populate(ItemizedOverlay.java:311) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.googlemaps.googleCacheOverlay.superPopulate(googleCacheOverlay.java:67) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.mapcommon.ItemizedOverlayBase.populate(ItemizedOverlayBase.java:26) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.mapcommon.cgMapOverlay.updateItems(cgMapOverlay.java:80) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.mapcommon.cgeomap$DisplayThread.run(cgeomap.java:1295)

		If spoiler images are available, there should be some kind of link to open them from the hint section of the cache details page. I suggest to have a right aligned picture/photo icon in the cache section, if spoiler images are available. Tapping that icon would then open the spoiler images activity, similar to the options menu. The user experience would be better (I regularly miss spoiler images), and for typical hints the additionally used space on the screen would be neglectable.

		Hi, after the update that fixed the issue with the missing dates, I did a refresh on all of my stored caches to get the dates of the logs. After that, the log dates are incorrect (they are situated in 2012 / 2013 sometimes. This is also the case with freshly downloaded caches. Thanks, Enze

		I am using the last nightly NB29.08.2011 but I am quite sure, that I have seen the problem before sporadically. However now I have a TB to reproduce it: If you open TB2EZMF with c:geo you will see a discover from 27.03.2011 but it is without text. If you look the same at gc.com you will see it actually has text : &quot;Ein dickes Plek, bestimmt gut zum Bassspielen &quot; If you look further down on the same TB-log you will see a &quot;placed&quot; log from 27.03.2011 on gc.com. This one is not shown at all in c:geo. More down there is a another discover on the same date by user &quot;blueguy&quot; on gc.com This one is also not shown in c:geo. More down there is a discover from from user &quot;Thomas S&quot; on gc.com On c:geo this discover is shown but for a wrong username (Blueguy). Maybe this has something to do with several logs on the same date ?? I hope you can reproduce this one.

		When I'm using my mobile phone in offline modus and I open c:geo with an other app by clicking on the URL to a cache, it tries to reload the cache, instead of using the stored one. I imported a PQ to c:geo and Locus, cause I only have offline maps for czech rep in Locus. When I click on a cache in Locus, there is a link to the Cache on Geocaching.com, which I can catch with c:geo. But then I get the message, that the download went wrong. So, when catching the gc.com-url, maybe check, if the cache is already stored. PS: Is there a way to see cache-description in locus?

		When the user drags the map, the position tracking remains on. This leads to confusion as the user drags the map, and then it jumps back to centre on the current position. This happens both with Google Maps and OpenStreetMaps. I think that c:geo's maps should follow the standard set by the Android Maps app, which is to disable tracking as soon as the user starts dragging the map. In a related note, I also feel that it would be nice if c:geo followed the Google Maps approach of putting the &quot;tracking button&quot; on the action bar instead of a floating button on the top corner of the map.

		in Issue #328 @cachapa suggested additionally to move the tracking toggle button to the action bar. This issue should allow to discuss this new feature seperately (it is in part discussed in #123 as well) Comments copied from #328: @cachapa: In a related note, I also feel that it would be nice if c:geo followed the Google Maps approach of putting the &quot;tracking button&quot; on the action bar instead of a floating button on the top corner of the map. @SammysHP: +1 for both. A more descriptive icon than the blue dot would be good, too. @koem: +1 for both! @Bananeweizen: Regarding the button placement: I'm not sure if the action bar is the best place. Currently this seems like a good solution. But I can imagine that we may have some additional controls in the near future (e.g 3 buttons instead of 1), then the action bar might get quite crowded. For instance, there are several applications for tracking your sports races which typically have multiple overlay controls directly on the map. @cachapa: In my view, if there's still space in the action bar, we should put it there. If at one point the action bar becomes crowded, this can be re-evaluated. The platform's UI guidelines should be followed whenever possible, which in this case means following the Google Maps app. In fact, I propose that the icon from Maps be adopted, as it will be the less confusing for new users.

		I've been working on small tweaks to the user interface as I get comfortable with c:geo's source code. Now I wanted to work a bit on the action bars. I realize that aesthetics vary from person to person, so I wanted to reach some agreement before I put in the work. Essentially, I wanted to retouch a few spots to bring the action bars closer to the Android standard, if you can call it that -- everyone seems to implement their action bars slightly differently, but there are a few common points. The tone is more or less set by the Google I/O app which is supposed to be the gold standard for Android UI patterns: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.iosched I think that we should follow those patterns as well. Anyway, my proposals: Make the vertical separator cover the whole height of the action bar (so that the action buttons really look like buttons); Add a separator currently missing in the leftmost button in the right group, for example, in http://cgeo.org/content/images/screenshots/s2.png the map button should have a separator on the left; Remove the separator paddings to make the buttons look square instead of rectangular, with the benefit that we win a bit of horizontal space Remove the separator next to the c:geo icon in the main activity I can do this myself, and in fact already started, but as I said, I wanted to get your agreement before changing the action bars in every activity.

			<description>
		I just tested c:geo on the Android 1.5 emulator, and I noticed there is no reaction to clicking the buttons in action bar. This is because Android 1.5 doesn't recognize the &quot;onClick&quot; XML property in the buttons, so the method never gets called. This is of course fixable, but the question is if it's really worth it. I'll leave that decision to the people who have access to the market statistics and who get the user complaints :-) P.S.: another thing I noticed is that the title bar in 1.5 doesn't disappear like in later versions. I guess this is also easily fixable.

		From what I remember, original cgeo were able to display only caches from a list. Now when you show map into list, all caches are displayed. Reading is then complex (I got a few hundred waypoints stored, because i use offline a lot). May be a new button &quot;show all&quot; / &quot;show list only&quot; could be valuable ( like enable/disable live ) ?

		I have seen this problem today the first time, and it may be difficult to reproduce: I have a list with caches and some of them have TBs shown by the icon in the list. Today I grabbed a TB from a cache on my list and it was the only TB listed in this cache. Afterwards I refreshed the cache-list (by refreshing the whole list as well as by refreshing the single cache). The cache-detail does not show a TB anymore but in list-view the TB-icon is still visible also after closing and reopening the list/app. Version used: NB31.08.2011

		It will be great to add &quot;Reverse Geocoding&quot; capability on waypoint. On a waypoint you could get address to go then easily with car ! I saw the field cache_location but it seems to be parsed from html page. I thought about a real revgeocode function using coords. Then, there are several ways to manage offline, because coords could be updated in offline mode! see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/472313/android-reverse-geocoding-getfromlocation

		How about a list of your friends. The list could show you how many caches they have found and on selecting one of them you could see the caches they found. The data for this is present on the website so mirroring it to the phone is quite logical to me. Would be nice to get this for easier comparison. Optional being able to add friends from this would be nice to have as well.

		In a running cgeo with a reasonable large number of caches the Strings from the cache description occupy a little bit more than half the overall memory that cgeo uses. Therefore cgeo should NOT load the cache description for displaying caches in a cache list only. The description String should only be loaded when displaying the cache in details view.

		When in other countries, the description mostly isn't in english or your mother language. Normally you cannot go caching then. c:geo should support a translation (e.g. by google translate) which will then be displayed instead of the original texts. After cache refreshing the original texts can be displayed again. Design like this: Choose to translate from menu - all texts will be translated, stored and shown. A progressbar is shown: &quot;translating title, translating short description, translating long description, translating log entry 1/12, ...&quot; Workaround could be #128 - copy text, go to google translate

		I just saved some caches and each of them took nearly a minute to do so. That looked like a bug to me. But it wasn't, they all were earth caches including an image within each log entry (and getting/saving those images took so long). To avoid users thinking the app crashed or is buggy, we should report some progress steps during saving a cache, e.g. Saving cache details log 1, 2, 3, 4, .... spoiler image 1, 2, 3, ... I don't want to report all internal details of the saving process. I just want some label of the progress dialog to change every some seconds, so the progress is visible.

		Static maps can be very valuable, when caching abroad (as data roaming is too expensive to be used). But the static maps are not very useful, as long as they do not show my own position. The Windows Mobile caching app &quot;GCzII&quot; has static maps, which show my position (of course allways updated, when I move). IMO c:geo should have this as well.

		Bernd Schreck sent me a mail with this ft. request: Hello everyone, while driving in the car (I am using my smartphone in a fixture) in an area with stored caches, the stand-by mode of the device in list-view is quite annoying. This year I used a &quot;holiday caches&quot;-list for our holiday destination area in order to see caches &quot;approaching&quot; on my route. To keep the &quot;holiday caches&quot;-list displayed (meaning to prevent the stand-by mode) on the phone I had to fiddle all the time with my fingers on the display. Improvement proposal for the list-view: ---&gt; Additional option in the list-view to prevent (i.e. enable) stand-by mode. Currently the list-view provides already a menue with &quot;Options&quot; that leads to &quot;Map&quot; and &quot;List&quot;. The new proposed option &quot;Stand-by mode ON&quot; i.e. &quot;Stand-by mode OFF&quot; could be implemented (added) there. Hope you ll like my proposal and implement this characteristic. Regards, Bernd

		I am running Gingerbread on HTC thunderbolt. When I click &quot;nearby&quot; I get a listing of the closest caches. If I then hit menu and &quot;show on map&quot; the map loads up but does not show any caches. This used to work, however the last few versions its been broken. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, logging in etc.

		From the german geoclub forum: If the live map is opened the position is (perhaps depending on the map type) not the last known position but some arbitrary place defined by the map itself. It should be explicitly set by c:geo to the last known position.

		I've been looking at the code for the cache lists (in the &quot;nearby&quot; and &quot;stored&quot; activities) trying to enable visual feedback when an item is selected, clicked or long-pressed. There are a few problems in showing the list selectors, and most of them are related to the UI for selecting multiple caches. To be clear, I think that selecting multiple caches is a nice feature, but I don't really like the way it's currently implemented. Particularly, the fact that one can fling any cache to the right to go into a kind of hybrid single-and-multiple-select mode. My problems with this are as follows: It's not obvious that the functionality is there; Sometimes the user tries to tap an item, but flings it by mistake; When one item has been flung, the list internally goes into the select-mode. In that mode, tapping a cache doesn't work anymore, even though visually the other caches still look clickable (this is made worse is the mode was started by mistake); Due to the way the fling detection works, it's basically impossible to enable visual feedback for those list items; There's a lot of code that goes into supporting this functionality which could be greatly simplified. I've also identified a few bugs related to that code which would be taken care of. Also, scrolling the list in multiple-select mode would get a significant performance boost. My proposal is to do away with the hybrid selection mode, and keep the exclusive multiple selection mode which can be enabled from the menu. I've been studying the code and I can do this myself, but I'd like your opinions on this before starting.

		Today I filtered my search results for multi-caches. Since starting a new search I only get multi-cache results. None of the taditionals (or other types) is show anymore. Even my saved caches are filtered the same way! The &quot;home screen&quot; says 10 saved caches but when opening te saved ones I can only see four caches - all of them multi-caches. Cancelling/resetting the filter does not make any difference. If this is not a bug but wrong usage then please help me, otherwise please fix this issue. Thank you, fama-berlin

		Hi. I just deleted about 30 caches from a list and noticed that its pretty slow. The list below the progress dialog is updating after every change (for each cache being removed). Maybe thats part of the problem. It would be better to &quot;freeze&quot; the the list and update it once after the operation finished. Rev

		The context field of cgSettings is used to call startActivity() in getLogin(). It works only because the context being saved is, indeed, an activity, and thus does not require to give FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK to start a new activity stack. Its type should be changed to Activity instead of Context, although storing the application context might make more sense in other cases. This needs to be thought of and redesigned. Edit: I think the home screen should check whether the settings activity should be launched to get missing or outdated information instead of starting the activity from getLogin(). This would solve this problem.

		One is cosmetic and one real bug If you enter coordinates with leading zeros (N46 04.005) it's displayed like N46° 4.005 That 0 would be great If you enter the same coordinates in &quot;Plain mode&quot; you always get &quot;000&quot; at the end. And yesterday I misstyped for 1. Instead of 005 I wrote 905. Save it and try to fix it. The dialog has your coordinates not the coordinates written on buttons.

		In some menus c:geo reuses the same menu icons for different functions. For example, in the cache list the &quot;Select mode&quot; icon is the same as the one for &quot;Log visit&quot; in the details view. In other places, generic icons are used, presumably because better ones weren't available. For example, the &quot;Open in browser&quot; in details view, which has a generic &quot;information&quot; icon. I propose that we adopt some of the icons from the free icon set from androidicons.com: http://www.androidicons.com/freebies.php It would obviously be nice if we could link back to them in the about page, or similar. I find that ok since they're offering a wonderful gift to the community for free. If you guys agree, I'll go over all the menus and post the proposed changes here for voting before implementation.

		inventoryItems is used in a cache to hold the number of trackables. It may be obtained as a result of a search, where we do not have the list of trackables, or from a cache details where we do have a list. It is an int, but the 0 value indicates either an empty inventory or the absence of information. We should distinguish between the cases.

		The indices in my database are: CREATE INDEX in_a on cg_caches (geocode);
CREATE INDEX in_b on cg_caches (guid);
CREATE INDEX in_c on cg_caches (reason);
CREATE INDEX in_d on cg_caches (detailed);
CREATE INDEX in_e on cg_caches (type);
CREATE INDEX in_f on cg_caches (visiteddate, detailedupdate); Many indices as missing as compared to what cgCache.cgDbHelper.onCreate intends to create. But this code tries to create separate indices using the same name (in_a for example). Since if not exists is used, later indices are not created. This probably contributes to the slowness of the database.

		It could be drawn just with a simple direction arrow + North-South direction arrow Current text information should be the same (sat, approx, distance, etc.) Even the update interval could be set slower (it could be an option: max, 1sec, 2sec, 5sec, etc.) All this could help save battery life.

		got a mail yesterday, I asked him about the error messages... Fist may be #438? Hello Karsten, I am using a SG3 (GT-I5800). I upgrated c:geo from NB 03.09.2011 to the latest revision NB 13.09.2011. After having installed the latest NB, I wasn't able anymore a) to search for the nearest caches (second main menue option) the app was searching caches for about a minute b) to search via live-map (first main menue option) the map showed up, some caches were found and displayed on the map. In both cases the app finally displayed an error message. I tried both options serveral times always with the same result. As I hadn't deleted the NB 03.09.2011, I installed this version again and both (live-map and nearest caches list) worked as supposed to. Finally I re-installed the latest NB 13.09.2011 again and noticed the same problems as described above. I hope this report will help you to find and to fix the root-cause of this issue. Kind regards, Bernd

		Ok. I might get down to why so many users have login problems. Go to settings, click check login (Should say OK) Change your username (or password) that login must fail (e.g. Add 1 letter to user) Click Check login You get &quot;Login OK&quot; and wrong password stored in database. I don't have time to check.

		Android 1.5 is force-closing on the latest version from the repository. The crash happens on cgBase.java on line 3950 with the following exception: &quot;java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils&quot;. It takes a while from startup until the crash happens (around 20~30 seconds here), so that might be why it's been going unnoticed.

		There should be an option of including several types of caches in search and live maps and what have you. Currently it's either all types or just one type. This filter should be modifiable for a single search instance w/o affecting the &quot;normal&quot; choice.

		E g i'd like Search to be able to find caches near Vitabergen, Stockholm, Sweden with trackables currently in place, but excluding any that have already been found by BengtB. This could be done by having radio buttons at each type of criteria for &quot;exclude/include&quot; and a single search query start link for all conditions specified, plus temp cache type selector for that single search.

		In the main activity there's a filter button which can filter caches by type globally in the app. Currently, this changes the label below the button, but it's a very subtle change, particularly since that label is almost always cut for lack of space. My proposal is to make the setting more visible by also changing the filter button's image. I propose a simple horizontal flip of the image, and adding a green led on top of the white switch in the image.

		The action bar background bitmap (actionbar_background_tile.png) appears 4 times in the project, one for each DPI level and an extra default. Since the background is just a simple gradient, it can be replaced by an XML shape drawable. This change alone will immediately shave around 80KB off the apk. The only possible issue is that on close inspection the background bitmap has a subtle &quot;roughness&quot; to it which I can't tell if it's by design or result of image compression.

		We should put the contents of readme and buildnotes together into one file readme.md. That file is then displayed with markup directly on the cgeo source page on github. For an example have a look at the contents of https://github.com/infinitest/infinitest (below the source list). Everything you see there is a simple text file at https://raw.github.com/infinitest/infinitest/master/README.md

		The drawable-mdpi only contains files which are duplicate from the ones in drawable. This is because Android 1.5 uses mdpi resolution and isn't able to find the mdpi folder, so all of its images need to be in drawable. As it is, it makes no sense to keep the drawable-mdpi folder around. It's making the program file bigger with zero benefit.

		Today all of a sudden I had mysterious problems interacting with gc.com using the release version - even before the update. Luckily after some tries I could reproduce and debug it on the emulator and found that gc.com in my case sent 'set-cookie' header instead of 'Set-Cookie' - which lead to successful login and 'not logged in' when requesting the cache page. Currently no idea why this happens.

		The format for spoilers image seem to have changed during the GC.com upgrade. We do not currently load spoiler images for caches that are not in our database. See GC2QM0K for example (unless you're having Marseille caches in your database :-) If someone wants to tackle this, that would be great, and we would be able to do a new release on the market.

		Live Map only shows caches for 3-4 seconds on a NookColor. Release 15-09-2011 for Market. Live Map only shows caches for 3-4 seconds. Then you get only the map, no caches. If you zoom in or out, the caches reappear for 3-4 seconds, then they are gone again. It used to work with the last c:geo (Radovan Paska aka carnero). Hasn't worked since cgeo-opensource started.

		I propose that we close release branches now that the releases have been done and replace them with tags, since development should not happen on those branches anymore. We should create two tags market_20110826 and market_20110915 corresponding to the versions that were uploaded by @mucek4 onto the market, and remove the corresponding branches. Note that this does not prevent from restarting a branch from those tags if we want to do a minor correction in a new release. But that would be a new release branch, and then a new release tag when uploaded to market. No objection?

		Following scenario: New installation try to enter coordinates the first time. Format selection is PLAIN, controls shown are degree,minutes,seconds switch input style to something else -&gt; FC Essentially this is an ArrayIndexOutofBounds exception in the coordinate parser when trying to parse an empty string. This is due to the plain text controls being empty, even if trying to workaround this situation by entering some coordinates. Only workaround is to pre-fill the dialog with own coordinates (if available) version: 1a961ab

		In some cases the parser produces incorrect results when parsing a coordinate string like &quot;N 49° 56.031&quot;, something the formatter happily and correctly produces given the correct input 49 + 56.031*60 = 49.93385. I have created a test case for it, but as it has to do with regex I suppose somebody else will be able to fix it faster then me.

I tried to create a new waypoint and tried to give it the coordinates: N49 11,929 E008 09,357 but it ALWAYS changes this to N49 11,933 E008 09,350 ?

		As discussed on the developer forum, tests in another repository makes them quite unusable, as they quickly go out of sync with the code, gets unmergeable at the same time as the code, and developers tend not to write tests because it requires accessing another repository. As it seemed to have reached a consensus there, I plan to reintroduce the tests into the main repository (as a separate Eclipse project, just as they are now, by just copying the content of the repository into the tests directory) so that they can be kept in sync with the code.

		Recently when storing a cache for offline us I had problems I select store, it then brings up a box 'saving cache for offline use....' and goes no further, I can back out of it, and can use the home button to do something else, but c:geo is stuck on that screen. Old way to restore c:geo is to power off the phone and back on again. Once up and running the stored cache is there and available for use.

		I quite often store a cache for offline use after just looking at it, and every time c:geo seems to need to download the cache again! I wonder why that is, as it has just downloaded the same info and should still hold it (after all the cache is still displayed!). Sometimes that second download can take a while and is annoying.

		We've just used c:geo in anger for the first time over the weekend. A brilliant app (Thank you!). There seems to be a strange issue with GPS accuracy. We have a premium account and were correctly loggged in. However, c:geo consitently gets the cache position wrong by 30-40 metres. This applies for both the compass and the maps (live map and locus). The system recognises where we are perfectly but messes up with the cache position. However, very strnagely, the downloaded static map gets the cache position perfectly (but we cannot navigate on these tiles!) For instance at GC2ZRG4 the cache is next to the main path (as seen on google maps and as found by us). The static map also shows it there. The live map shows our own position correctly but both the compass and c:geo map point us 30 metres off the path. This happened consistently with every cache we did so we ended up just having to use the Garmin...... We are running the most up to date version of c:geo on a HTC HD2 which is currently running Core Droid Desire HD Froyo v 1.7. Any solutions The Sweeney Toddlers

		These should maybe be added as separate issues, but I guess they are small and easy, so they can probably be tracked here. a) Logs should be auto-saved (but ofcourse not posted to gc.com) when pressing &quot;back&quot;. One time too many I have written a long log, and accidentally pressed &quot;back&quot; and had to write it all over again. Maybe add a &quot;clear&quot;-button (with prompt) to clear the log field if anyone ever wants to delete everything they have written without having to long press -&gt; select all -&gt; delete. b) Signature should be placed below cursor position. Currently the cursor is placed at the bottom, below the signature, when i start logging which is usually not what at least I expect. c) Logs on cache page does not show all (unicode) characters. I guess this has to do with either the font used, or Android per se, so it might not be an easy fix. You can add a number of unicode-chars to your logs by using the html entities (IE ✐). They show up fine on the web (gc.com), but not on the phone, where they are simply displayed as squares. It would be great if the font used in the app was able to show more of these characters.

Let me know what information you might need from me. I can u/l a logcat file is you need that as well.

		I have installed c:geo nightly 20.09. and the help-app from markt on my Asus Transformer. If I try to open the help (e.g. from main screen) it only shows &quot;Please wait&quot; and a failure message in the background. If I deinstall the help-app the help-button works correctly (going to online-help via Brwoser). On my phone the same versions are running well with offline-help. Screenshot follows

		With &quot;Don't show found or owned caches&quot; set, in live map, found / owned caches flicker on and off, seemingly at random. Activate Live/Inactivate Live merely changes precisely which caches flicker or disappear or show up, and not in any rational way. Seemingly. There's probably a very predictable mechanism at work, but I cannot see what the misbehaviour depends on. &quot;flicker&quot; is triggered by Time, wait long enough and caches will disappear or reappear Moving, move the map so that a cache site gets inside the map area shown and you get flicker all over, If a found cache is shown, looking at the description shows no &quot;Found&quot; label.

		A lot of compiler-warnings are suppressed - like warnings for: unused parameters of methods missing @override annotations Unnecessary cast from x to x redundant nullchecks Imho, correcting these problems result in better (more readable and easier to maintain) code, but I would like to hear your opinions: Do 'we' want these 'problems' corrected, or should I leave it like it is?

		I uploaded a PQ into c:geo with 500 caches and stored the caches. It was then possible to show the stored caches on the c:geo livemap but for some reason it wouldn't show them in Locus. Smaller cache lists work fine. Is there a limit to the number of caches that c:geo can open in Locus? I only ask because it's a limitation for offline caching (which we do a lot).

		Today I went caching with the market version 24.09. and encountered that waypoint sometimes get lost. I found a way to reproduce: Search for caches (e.g. by adress) which are not in the database Select a cache with waypoints and store it (the waypoints are correctly shown up to now End c:geo Start c:geo again and do the same search as before (e.g. by adress) Select the previously saved cache from the results Select one of its waypoints and it shows &quot;Unbekannte Koordinaten&quot; with the red-dot symbol Refresh the cache-details Waypoints are OK again There may be other ways to have this error (e.g. when selecting the cache from saved list), but I found only this one reproducibly.

		When I try to click on a go4cache icon (red dot) on the live-map while using OSM it is very difficult to get the info-window open. Doing the same while Google Maps is active is much easier (as it should be). It is like the accepted radius for tapping on the screen is much lower when OSM is displayed. Happens with OSM:Mapnik and OSM:Offline. Works OK with Google:Map. Others not tested. Regards, Lineflyer

		Sometimes, found caches are still shown on the map (with exclude found caches option turned on - naturally). This seems to be somewhat related to the loading process not being complete. As if the filter is applied AFTER all caches in the view have been loaded. Not entirely sure, but i believe it also happened after the view was completely updated. The caches aren't even marked by smilies. This is particulary problematic when you are moving the map around much, exploring the area. I believe there was a bug some time ago that the found-filter sometimes stopped working at all. A workaround was to disable-&gt;goto map and re-enabled the option (also not entirely sure about that). Could be some problem with already &quot;cached cashes&quot; too?! Regards, Rev

		As discussed in #553 I'd like to add image support for images associated with a cache (spoilers and images from the image gallery) as sometimes this helps a lot :) I plan to add a new section in the details view similar to the trackables section. The image will be loaded and displayed when the user clicks on an image (similar to the trackables). Any suggestions how I can determine the image urls because there is no direct connection from the cache data to the images. The image gallery has to be parsed at first.... What about - for a first version - a new menu entry that opens the images in the browser if there are any images associated with the cache ?

		Right now, some coordinates are printed depending on the current locale, and some are printed with a fixed format. Example: French/German localized: &quot;N 48° 3,123&quot; fixed format: &quot;N 48° 3.123&quot; (note the dot instead of the comma) This leads to inconsistencies in the user interface, and a recent reformatting to remove redundant information made a unit test fail in non-English locale. What format should we use? If we want to always use the same format (which I would favor), we should merge pull request #572 and close #571. If we want localized strings (which seem to be rare), we should merge pull request #571 and close #572. What do you think? As a side note, we should probably finish the GeoFormatter class afterwards and use it everywhere for consistency.

		It should be possible to switch to a list view from the live map. That would make it handy to first select a map piece with certain caches, then show them as list and store only a selection of them. Now I have instead choosen a map area with 102 caches, but I only want to store about 30 of those. There is no way to do this currently. It only works by storing all and afterwards deleting.

			<description>
		If you input a keyword in the keyword search and press the return key, the focus jumps to the next input field (or the button, depending on the Android version, as it seems). And this is the same for mainly all other one line input fields, which have a button to invoke an action using the value of the input field. I suggest to instead directly invoke the button action when pressing the enter key in the input field. (And when doing this refactoring, the IME_ACTION_GO should also invoke the same action). Anybody with different opinions?

			<description>
		If you open the log cache activity without holding a trackable in your GC account, an error is logged in the system log. This is because the parsing expects the table with the trackables to be there always. I would like to fix that, but for a good test driven change I first need test data, that is a logging web page with trackables. Can someone who currently has at least one TB in his account, please open a web page to post a log on an arbitrary cache (http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?ID=****) , save that web page and commit it into the repo or send via mail? I don't really want to hunt some caches now just to implement that fix. :) Alternatively you may also take the issue and fix it yourself...

		It looks like the directory /sdcard/.cgeo contains lots of cache/trackable jpeg pictures that are never cleaned up. Shouldn't those be cleared when they get out of the database?

		If you download a offline map from mapsforge.org and put it in /sdcard/.cgeo directroy it will not be found if you press the 3-dot-button under Settings-&gt;Map sources. Creating a new dir it works. Because of the dot in .cgeo?

			<description>
		I can not tell the specific error, but often the storage time in the cache-details (&quot;Stored in device x days ago&quot;) can not be correct. I recognized sometimes that e.g. the las log shown was from 10 days ago and the storage time said 1 day ago. After refreshing I can see new logs older than 1 day. In general the days shown often are less than the real last save date. Mabe there is some operaation resetting the value although the cache details have not been updated. This might be in conjunction with updating the app (by instllaing nightly builds) but I am not sure. If I find a way to reproduce I will post it.

			<description>
		From email: Dear cgeo-developers, since some months we use cgeo with our HTC Desire HD - thanks at this point for you great work!!! Before (and still now) we use a HTC Touch Pro2 under WinMobile 6 and the software &quot;gatecacher&quot; (by Dennis Baremans). This software has one feature that works perfect when approaching a cache (especially by bike): at certain distances (every 50m from 950 to 150m, every 10m from 150m to 50m, every 5m from 50m to 10m and then every meter) they are given by playing these predefined sounds (wav-files) together with the current angle (also as sound). Sounds for distances larger than 950m are not available but from time to time the current angle is spoken. This wonderful feature unfortunately no Andoid-GC-Software consists of as far as I know It would be wonderful if in any future cgeo could get something like this. Yours Uwe

			<description>
		Hi, when I export a bunch (e.g. 500 Caches) from GSAK to a GPX File (v 1.0 or v 1.1) and import it to c:geo, no childwaypoints are imported. The rest of the information is fine. To narrow the error down: When I import a single cache (direct GPX from GC or exported via GSAK) the child waypoint is parsed correctly and also shows on the map. But it doesn't work with a GPX file that contains multiple caches. I can provide you with sample GPX files for testing. Thanks for your work John

		In my personal settings I didn't enter a password for GCVote.com. I don't use it (anymore), i'm not interessed in the ratings - i am looking at the favorite points now. But during the parsing of a cache a http request is made to gcvote.com for the rating. I don't want that request. I want my cache parsed as fast as possible. I propose to link the request to the existance of the GCvote.com password. Do the request only if the extra password has been entered, don't make a request if there's no such password. What do you think about this ?

		Try to select an input-field / button with the nav-keys in the &quot;Any destination&quot; view. It selects the whole form and then the entries in the history.

		The cache details activity has 6 (!!!) different progress dialogs as fields. I'd like to completely remove those and instead have one progress dialog wrapper class which internally manages one progress dialog, but takes away all the resource management. The only open question I have: Is it possible to have multiple progress dialogs shown concurrently in Android? And if so, does that make sense? Do we use something like that somewhere? I'm asking because I would like to write that wrapper in such a way, that there can be only one progress dialog at any time. Simplifies things a lot.

			<description>
		In getMatch(), we try to avoid keeping large strings in memory (such as a whole web page) when we only need a small part by using an explicit String constructor, in a way similar to     final String newString = new String(oldString); However, when looking at Android sources (through my CyanogenMod checked out copy), I noticed that this constructor is implemented as     public String(String string) {
        value = string.value;
        offset = string.offset;
        count = string.count;
    } which defeats the purpose, value being the real storage. To avoid keeping long strings around, if this is needed, we may have to use something like    final String newString = new String(oldString.getBytes()) Comments, thoughts?

		I just opened a (non live) map for 10 caches around the world, showing the whole earth. Afterwards I opened live map, which used the same zoom level. That's absolutely not useful, so the zoom level for the live map should be limited in such a way, that you cannot &quot;zoom out&quot; further than that limit.

We can only create such waypoints based on manually entered coordinates or based on my current coordinates. Therefore I suggest an additional button &quot;Cache coordinates&quot; in the coordinate input dialog, which works similar to the &quot;my coordinates&quot; button.

		We currently have 7 main menu items in the options menu of cache lists. As only 6 are shown at a time, we always have &quot;Map&quot; and &quot;List&quot; under the &quot;more&quot; button. This is even true for an empty list. There you see 3 disabled menu items, but you have to use the &quot;more&quot; button to get to the list management so you can delete the empty list. I suggest that for empty lists (and only for those) the disabled menu items are also hidden to avoid clicking through multiple menus.

		We have no type for locationless caches in our cache type enumeration. But we have icons for them (and put them in the icon lookup maps). We should either remove them completely or support them fully. Which way to go?

 I think there are several things to fix in Progress: methods should be made synchronized because when using background tasks several things can happen simultaneously if the user goes back and reenters a cache details activity for example Progress.show should take a handler rather than a boolean cancelable to install the proper handler in this case (which will ultimately dismiss the dialog before letting another activity / background task use it) in Progress.dismiss, dialog should be set to null in any case A better fix would probably not to have a static Progress but to have a Progress instance as a field in cgeodetail.

		For me it doesn't make sense to hide the caches already found by me in the list of founds by others (clicking on a user or owner name) despite having it enabled in the configuration. This should only apply to normal search on live map or nearby search. Thanks

Reproduce: Open details for GC1ZXEZ Click on owner field You will see &quot;%2f&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot; in the header of the popup (this will be the problem) Inside the log area the function is OK.

		parseSearch() still has the same problems that we already fixed in parseCache(), namely that it holds the complete webpage of every cache from the search results in memory. I'll apply a short term fix for this memory leak by adding a String constructor call, but we should really refactor that method to use the BaseUtil mechanisms.

		As written in #670, some operations using Progress are marked as cancellable but no handler is called when the user cancel (by going back) the current operation to really cancel the ongoing task. This should be fixed.

		Hi, It'll be great when cgeo can load many caches on one click, it could be implemented same way as waypoint download from geocaching.com search results. If it is possible to add button there It'll be useful. Thanks I'm not so good in javascript so I had tryed but I can't do that.

		I have found several caches and submitted my find online. When I look at a live map it does not give me the smiley face. If you click on the cache and open it - it will say found - and my log post is there. Why am I not getting the smiley face? I keep going to a bunch of caches thinking I have them to do - but in fact when I open the cache - then realize I have found it already. Am I doing something wrong? Also, since I am new to the geocaching thing - perhaps most of this is my fault? Why when I try and log a find online (using my Moto Droid) SOMETIMES - it says the cache is not available and it will only let me SAVE for offline use? Also - last question -- I just did my first &quot;series&quot;. Is there a way to change the coordinates on my gps? Example -- had to find 7 caches - each had a clue to the GPS coordinates of the FINAL CACHE. Using C:Geo -- is there a way that I can enter those coordinates AFTER I found them all? Again using the Motorola Droid - the c:geo is my ONLY source of navigation/GPS. This app is AWESOME!!! I love it - just not sure if its me or is there something wrong?

		I'd like to refactor cgCache. First I'd like to change the direct access of the members into getters and setters method calls. Second, I'd like to introduce a class hierachy. An interface &quot;ILogable&quot; with basic operations for all kind of caches, trackables, challenges. Different implementations like GCCache, Trackable, OCCache, Challenge and so on. Your opinion on that ?

		From facebook: I have a feature suggestion. I like to solve Unknown/mistery caches but usually when solved I don't go there to log for long time (some times I even forget them forever). So I would love an option to filter the Stored caches to easily find the ones I solved, maybe by filtering the ones with custom placed waypoints as I usually store there the final coordinates. Maybe just having an option to custom mark them in the list, something like the orange bar placed beside the caches found but not yet logged or the green one for the solved. Maybe a Blue or Violet bar? I don't really know what's the best way but it will be a very usefull addition anyway :D

		When we currently store a cache, then we always load the (potentially) existing current cache with the same geocode from the database, merge the old cache into the new one and store the new one. This is generally fine and gives correct results (so we have the most recent fields and so on). But this approach takes a huge amount of time. For most of our search operations (like &quot;near me&quot;), the storeWithMerge() is responsible for half the runtime. So it would be good if we could implement the merge differently (e.g. by only writing the newer values into the database, avoiding loading the cache details at all). You should also think about it from this perspective: We typically get new cache information from a (online) search, but that contains only partial cache data (e.g. only the most important fields). We then load the old cache (with all the fields), copy all those fields into the new cache, and save all the fields of the new cache into the database. That way we copy the large information chunk into the small one. And afterwards we store all fields, although only some have changed.

		I often find concurrent requests (here the last three GET requests start before the previous one has returned), which probably explain the concurrent access causing data corruption and exceptions while browsing the live map as the results may be handled concurrently. Anyway, this is a real problem that must be fixed independently of whether it fixes all the map issues or not. D/cgeo    (24758): GET http://www.geocaching.com/map/default.aspx

		Google issued an update to the Android development tools and the Eclipse plugin. Unfortunately, the ant scripts are not compatible with previous versions, so people having upgraded cannot use ant anymore unless the configuration is updated, and people that have not upgraded cannot use the new version. So we should all upgrade to the up-to-date version. I created a new branch new-development-tools. People having an up-to-date development environment can test it and report here. Note that using those development tools, I was able to confirm that c:geo still works in a Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) emulator.

		I have noticed this change in the past few versions or so of c:geo. If I am using road maps (default) I cannot zoom in as far as before. If I use satellite view it will allow me to zoom in closer than road maps allow. I can tell this because of my distance from the cache. Did something get changed to limit the road map zoom level or is it actually something that Google changed? PS. Also satellite views last zoom level is always black.

		Maybe I'm wrong, but when you started to show circles on map around caches, those for traditionals were red, filled and not dotted. Now they are all black, dotted and very slim, as they were for Multis and Mysteries, because their header-koords mostly are wrong. So they are hardly seen on Google-Satellite-Map. When switching from Google to OSM or otherwise... the Circle-option get lost, but no big problem

		When a gpx file from a pocket query is imported that has a waypoints file attached, the progress bar shows correct progress for importing the cache file, wrong progress for the waypoints file and no progress for storing the caches in DB. Reason is that the progress bar is initialized once with the size of the cache file in cgeogpxes but not updated later for the import of the waypoints file or when storing the caches. Control is handed over to GPXParser that doesn't know about the progress bar. My proposal is to put control over file handling and storing of caches into cgeogpxes and remove it from GPXParser. GPXParser gets rid of all the static methods and provides only: Collection parse(InputStream, Handler) Simple API, nicely testable. Ok, LocParser would need some more rework. This refactoring would also make it easier to add support for importing pocket query zips directly. What do you think?

		Google Maps seems not to restrict itself to the range of longitude we deem acceptable. For example, look at a cache, zoom out until you see the whole earth, and you might get: E/cgeo    (11001): cgMapView.draw: cgeo.geocaching.geopoint.Geopoint$MalformedCoordinateException: malformed longitude: -335.1517
 This can even go further as in: E/cgeo    (11001): cgMapView.draw: cgeo.geocaching.geopoint.Geopoint$MalformedCoordinateException: malformed longitude: -560.1517
 where you see the whole Earth several times on your screen. We should fix this in two parts: Geopoint should take care of the modulo operation and accept any longitude as valid when it comes from microdegrees. We should not allow zoom levels allowing the representation of the whole earth as we are not ready to deal (in live map for example) with physical earth locations being present several times on the displayed map.

		From email: I still offering feature &quot;RESUME&quot; The idea for Manage -&gt; Refresh All. After every succsessfull cache downloading put its number (just number in cgeo, not the name) into some file at the disk. If in time of download cgeo is crashes, user could start cgeo againg, then choose Manage -&gt; Resume Refresh All to start downloading not from the 1-st cache, but from last downloaded. As I see it will be a solution for this issue. Every can download GPX file, and Refresh it again and again :) This is something between bug, refactoring and future request. What do you think?

		If c:geo cannot load an online image, it will show drawable/image_not_loaded.png instead. I suggest to use a smaller image instead, because if I have a cache with several images which all cannot be loaded, there is no use in showing multiple large &quot;empty&quot; images instead. I just want to scroll over them, because they have no value for me. And the other thing is: Users may have gotten used to this image representing &quot;could not load image&quot;, but the image itself absolutely does not reflect this status. Something like the good old browsers &quot;red cross in empty image&quot; may be suited better to transport the message, even if it is not as nice. Something like http://www.iconarchive.com/show/oxygen-icons-by-oxygen-icons.org/Status-image-missing-icon.html http://findicons.com/icon/185419/image_missing?id=362146 Comments? Other opinions?

		I think I found an easy solution for the out of memory issue when downloading caches. That code creates bitmaps which are not used afterwards. Mainly I wanted to change something else in cgHtmlImg, so this was merely a side effect (but that's why my commit will include some other refactorings).

		Good morning. At our last cache attack event 2011 in Nordhorn i'd liked to leave a peace of my inventory. but I had to search a lot of time, to find the action menu to leave it @ the event in c:geo. it would be nice, when the inventory action &quot;button&quot; becomes a real button. so it is easier to the that behind the text &quot;no action&quot; is a menu with more actions. thank you and nice work =)

		As far as I've seen, cache data for offline use is currently either spidered online from the gc website or imported from gpx-files. Have you already thought of importing cache data from the saved html-page of a cache detail site? You would save the cache detail site as html page, put it in the .cgeo folder on the sdcard and let cgeo import it from there without contacting the gc site at all. This way, the gc site would not be spidered with your login data and you do not have to create a pocket query. You just open the cache you like in your browser and use the &quot;Save Page&quot; - &quot;Html only&quot; feature of the browser. Of yourse, this is only practicable if you don't want to import dozens of caches. But for getting the details of a few caches this is a fast and secure method. (I got the cgeo source code and did a proof-of-concept implementation, which works great for me. I did not create a pull request because I possibly have overlooked something in the implementation and because I'm new to the git cvs and the whole project).

		When using c:geo it sometimes forcecloses, it is more probable to happen when I have more caches saved. c:geo is usable with about 50 offline caches, but using more is really pain. I would be great to have about thousand caches saved (around all locations where I normally am). How can I help with debugging this ?

		Hi there. Last weekend i was caching with someone who doesn't have a premium account. There was a lot confusion about where to go next, because she wasn't seeing the premium caches on the map at all and I wasn't able to take into consideration what caches we should/could skip because they all look the same.

		I have the latest c:geo (ver. 31.10.2011) running on Android 2.2. I posted some geocache found logs over the weekend using c:geo but when I checked the History list, not all of those geocaches are in the list. I think the History list is missing about half of the geocaches that I logged, even though those geocaches show up in Quick View on the geocaching website. What could be going wrong?

		Our GeopointFormatter class is great but not optimal: we do not need to generate arbitrary formatted coordinates. This would be different if it belonged to a library. Reducing it to the set of formats used internally in c:geo reduces the total code size by approximately 200 lines, and ensures maximum performance. Of course, the old one will still be recoverable from git if someone wants to use it in a library.

		As we generalize the use of Geopoint, we get it by the fact that Google Location objects are not always in the expected bounds. In particular, our current adjustments are probably wrong when dealing with a viewport which encompasses the 180° meridian. Any latitude and longitude should be accepted. Since we use Android methods to compute distances and bearings, we do not have to deal ourselves with wrap around and such.

		Just today a strange idea came into my mind and I want to ask you about your opinion and about the general feasibility: Since some weeks you implemented the import of QR-Codes via QR-Droid,etc to scan GC-Codes. When selecting this feature it also allows me to open Google Goggles. This made me think about the following: I tried Goggles to read a Travel Bug Dog Tag and it worked, that it delivered back the TB-code from the tag. Would it be possible to allow scanning of the code and opening the TB-page with it ? Just today I went again to a TB-Hotel with &gt;10 Bugs and most of them without description of the goal. So I had to input each code manually into the c:geo search to look them up. I dont really know if scanning is faster, but if Goggles is working reliable it could save a lot of manual input (and its a really sophisticated feature :) )

		(Using NB1311- 01a6ad6) After updating my phone (Samsung Galaxy SII) to Android 2.3.4 I have a strange problem: When using the coordinates input (e.g. by &quot;Any destination&quot;) with the input helper (format: DDD MM.MMM) all the fields are preselected on access as usual. This means when I start typing the previous content is replaced by the numbers I enter. This is still working normal in all fields except for the MM input of longitude: After entering the DDD information the focus jumps to the MM field and the content is preselected normally, but if I input some digits they are just appended to the exisiting digits. The MMM field is again working normal. The strange thing is, that if I selected the android default keyboard instead of the Swype keyboard it is working normal again. Now you could say, that this is a pure Samsung-Swype problem, but I found out the following: If I use the latest market version (instead of the NB mentioned above) the behaviour changes a little bit. With this version the same problem also occurs in the MM field of the latitude (North/south) coordinates. This field was OK in the NB-version. This brings me to the conclusion that the problem is based by the Swype-keyboard but also somehow related to a programming issue. I hope you can follow my explanations...it is a little hard to describe the problem.

		This is an UI improvement request. Having not tracked the development for some time I only noticed by chance that the stored caches icon now has a context menu that opens when the user long taps on the icon. This is unexpected as the user has no visual clue of this added functionality. For instance, Google apps add visual clues when there are additional functions associated with action bars and icons; usually a down-pointing triangle. I would suggest to add a small down-pointing arrow to the top-right hand edge of the icon, as this is the usual position, at least in left-to-right locales. For this to work, the number of stored caches needs to be shifted to the top-left hand edge of the symbol.

It doesn't seem to get updated, this the map will contain an area where it lacks markers albeit there should be markers shown. Note: only tested with OSM offline maps.

		This seems to be a problem with the OSM offline map view: if waypoints are shown on a map and a waypoint happen to be near the geocache it is associated with (such as a Parking waypoint), then tapping on the geocache marker brings up the waypoint instead, albeit it is layered below the geocache marker and thus not shown. Similar, if multiple waypoints and/or geocache markers are in close proximity the layering of the display is the inverse of the hit-test layering: the user taps on the topmost marker, but c:geo detects the lowestmost marker instead. Probably both issues are related, thus I filed them together in a single issue.

		In NB 1411 the logview is always showing&quot;Logging not possible&quot;. Only after switching from Found to other log type and back again its normal. I did not log a cache up to now but at least the prompt is wrong in log view. Is this a new feature ?

		It is obviously not possible to do an offline log if no login data is given (the whole log-menu is missing). That sounds strange to me. Is there a reason? The logic for adding (offline) log menu entries is in class &quot;ActivityMixin&quot; in function &quot;addVisitMenu&quot;.

		The UI of c:geo is slightly inconsistent for the menu item icon for &quot;scan QR code&quot; (main screen): it shows a barcode. However, for reasons of visual consistency, it should show a (simplified) QR code. This allows users not familiar with the term QR code to better understand what this function is for and to easily identify QR codes when they see them.

After selecting cgeo loading starts but quickly fails with message from text label &quot;err_dwld_details_failed&quot;. No error message in log.

		This is a request for frontend improvement: the &quot;navigate any location&quot; activity has a history of past locations entered. However, its use is currently rathing limited. In particular: the user can only delete a history waypoint or navigate using the compass. the user cannot navigate any other method, such as maps, et cetera. A long tap on a waypoint brings up only the option to delete. the user cannot recall a history waypoint. My suggestion is to change the activity as follows: when the user taps on a history waypoint, its coordinates get transferred to the input field. No navigation is done yet. the user then may choose to edit the waypoint or navigate using the same methods as when entering a new waypoint. the existing &quot;shortcut&quot; of tapping on a history waypoint and navigating by compass should be removed as its use conflicts with easy recall, editing, and navigating by other means.

		Last days the check for being online in log-view has been introduced. Since I am using the corresponding nightlies I recognized that the log-view shows &quot;Logging not possible&quot; for some time (depends on network speed: WLAN 1-2 seconds, 3G up to 10 seconds) unitl the network-status is known and only then changes to the normal &quot;Log&quot;). In order to avoid user complaints and misunderstandings I would suggest to show the normal &quot;Log&quot; at first and only change to &quot;Logging not possible&quot; after it has been detected that the network is not available.

		Testing and developing with Eclipse overwrites my Market version of c:geo - i can't use the automatic update anymore because the Market version is signed with a different key than my Eclipse version.... Normally i use my personal, latest build when i am on a cache tour to find bugs... In case of bugs this can be very annoying and i need a fallback to the Market version. I have to deinstall c:geo and download it again from the market.... A parallel installation of the Eclipse (developer) version of c:geo would solve this problem. While developing we could use a different AndroidManifest.xml than for the release build. Your opinions about this ? And: how does Android distinguish two different applications ? Name of the apk file ?

		When I was caching today, I played with the Android sound recorder on the way back home from the cache (to record a &quot;voice log&quot;). I suggest to make that an official integrated feature: Have a new menu item in the visit activity to record audio (which just invokes the native audio recorder). When the audio recorder closes, it returns a content URI for the recording. We would need to save that with the cache (and change the DB for that). Playback of the recording could be invoked from a second menu item in the visit activity or from the history. As the audio stuff is handled by the recorder, we don't need additional permissions. Example code: http://www.openintents.org/en/node/114

		Hi, I found a problem related to event caches. Use case: Open an event cache in c:geo Menu -&gt; Add to calendar Close cgeo Open your calendar application Find and open the event The &quot;location&quot; of the event has coordinates and is clickable on my Sony Ericsson phone. Click on the location. Google Maps will open but will not find anything because the coordinates mm/ddd are separated by &quot;,&quot; where GoogleMaps requires &quot;.&quot; (After editing the calendar item and replacing &quot;,&quot; with &quot;.&quot; then GoogleMaps will load location). Thus. Coordinates added to calendar should have &quot;.&quot; instead of &quot;,&quot;.

		As discussed in #823, there is still an issue with the GPX import (activity being destroyed at a bad time). This could be solved by importing the GPX file directly in the main activity (or the cache list activity respectively). Would solve that activity leaking problem and also make the screen &quot;a bit more colored&quot; during the import operation. :)

		Feature request: I would be good to have an option to see the list of TBs which are currently in the hands of the user and open the detail page from there. Use Case: Sometimes I want to look up the goals of the TB i currently have with me. The only possibilty is to use the search for each TB which means I first have to lookup the tracking code every time. Also in the log view the TBs are ony listed but not linked to the TB-details. On http://www.geocaching.com/my/default.aspx there is a list of the users inventory, which could be used to make a inventory list also in cgeo. This could be a new menuitem in search and there could also be a link from logview to open the listed TBs detail page.

		While I like the new details page, I don't like the look of the page indicator at the bottom. I've now seen that this can be replaced easily using existing libraries like https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator. Please install the app from https://market.android.com/details?id=com.viewpagerindicator.sample and play around with it. That's quite a difference to what we currently have. I'm not exactly sure how our indicator should look like, but I think, one of the samples of that app with the underline style might match our current theming and style quite well. Comments from your side?

		I have seen a strange thing, which is hard to describe (NB 3011): If I have the live-map activated and click on a random cache it shows e.g. in the german version Typ Traditional-Cache (Unbekannter Typ) If I switch cgeo to english (incl. restart) I see in the same situation: Type Traditional-Cache (Unbekannter Typ) That leads to the following questions: Why is this prompt always in german ? Why is it &quot;Unbekannter Typ&quot; because that is the prompt for an unknown cache-type not the size, which is normally displayed there. I am quite sure, that in older versions the size information was available in live map. At the moment it is only available, if the cache details have already been loaded (and thus stored) before

		Currently we are using a lot of built-in icons from Android (e.g. android.R.drawable.ic_menu_agenda). The problem is, that they are sometimes very colorful and change from Android version to version. I'd suggest to import them from the Gingerbread-branch.

		What's our strategy on updating libraries? commons-lang3 has a new released version since some days, to which we could update. My personal opinion is to always update to the latest version of any included library, because that typically has less bugs for the features which were already in the old version (and which we may therefore use).

		In Live-Map-mode I can use &quot;show as list&quot; and I can save the caches to the &quot;default&quot;-list. I can't directly save caches to an other list. I can't even move caches, that are already saved on the phone! I always have to go &quot;saved&quot; to move caches around. :( Even in detail-mode, there is no way to put the cache to a specific list. I alway have to go to the list and have to move it from there. With 500 caches in a list, it is REALLY hard to find the specific cache again, when you memory is as old as mine :) Please make it possible to move a (already saved) cache to specific list.

		Currently only few TBs fit one one page on the new TB-page. I have seen that a quite big font is used and there is one free line before and after the TB-name. Would it be possible to use a little smaller font or remove the empty lines so that more TB fit one one screen without scrolling. Of course it should not get so small that users can not easily tap it, but right now its a really big section for each TB.

		The logs view of the cache details view has a progress indicator. In the emulator, I can always see that indicator in the middle of the view. On my device, there is no progress indicator. If I'm fast enough when opening the cache, I always have just a black screen and suddenly the logs are there.

		I've experienced an issue where I use the login check to confirm if I'm logged in or not, and receive an OK. But the results from the live map are as if I'm not logged it. I do not see my finds, and the coords are fuzzy by 20-30 metres. Every so often, when I do a login check, I see my AVATAR as well as the OK. Then the live map shows my finds, and the coords are OK. The login check is unreliable. My unit is an HTC Wildfire using Android 2.2.1

		This issue is hard to reproduce and hard to describe, nevertheless I want to share my todays observation: I had the live-map opened and GC-caches as well as some OC-caches are displayed. While driving around in my car I noticed, that the OC-caches disappear well before the iconr eached the edge of the map. I used the horizontal-mode not the landscape-mode, so it will not be most likely not linked to #279. After manually adjusting the map a little towards the OC-cache they appear again. The GC-caches display is OK all the time. Maybe someone could have a look if the boundaries on the map for the OC-caches are the same as for GC-caches.

		Hi, I have a problem with a specific cache: http://coord.info/GC37GFJ If I clock on it on the map, I get an FC. If I store it or just search for it based on the GC code, it is displayed, but here is the problem, I get more waypoints than what one can see on gc.com website. Further more, the initiale coordinates are wrong (not a big deal for a mutli cache). Can someone reproduce and identify the bug?

		Since we have the new cache descriptions, you get a much better overview of the cache properties. Nevertheless, I sometimes find myself sliding to the waypoints view, just to see it's empty. In contrast to the friends log view we cannot just have it hidden for caches without waypoints because otherwise that button would have to be part of the (already full) options menu. That's why I suggest to have the number of waypoints in the page title of the waypoints page. That way one can immediately see whether or not sliding into that view makes any sense. So you would know that sliding is useful here: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/267/wp6.png/ but not here: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/88/wp0k.png/ Any objections? As you can see at the screenshots the code is already available and eager to be committed. :)

		Steps to reproduce Update final coordinates in gc.com website Open c:geo, go to the saved caches, go to the one you just modified Press update, and wait for it to finish Press Menu, Navigate, Static maps Expected result Static map of new coordinates Actual result Static map of old coordinates Notes I'm using nightly build from this morning. Also, I tired to delete the cache, and save it again, and then, when I tried to display static maps, I get a Toast message saying it can't find them. Then, I pressed the back button, to show the list of saved caches, and the cache I just downloaded wasn't there, so I guess there is also something broken.

		When I navigate to cache using some OSM map, tha acticity FC with following logcat: E/AndroidRuntime(15206): FATAL EXCEPTION: Overlay

 It doesn't happen with Google maps. And sometimes, it need to be rotated twice, before the FC. As I see the stacktrace, there is not much you can do, since it's probably bug in mapsforge.

		I am beginning to feel that this problem is unique to me... I launched c:geo today after not having used ti for several days. It appeared that we were still logged in. I was having some issues getting a 3G connection, so I rebooted my phone. after that, I launched c:geo and logged in. Everything worked just fine as we found our first cache of the day. We then drove, about 10 minutes, to a second cache. When we got there, I launched c:geo and we were logged out. I know this happened because a) the locations of the caches 'jumped' and b) a nearby cache we had found no longer showed the smiley. I again logged in, and after a minute or so, the smiley reappeared. What happened next, however, was truly strange. We found the cache using the map view/google satellite. The location of the cache appeared to be within 5 meters of our location as shown in the map. However, the cache information page indicated that the cache was 30+ meters away. I then used a separate program to grab the current GPS location. Using a distance calculator showed that the GPS location was within 8 meters of the cache location. So, why did the info page indicate the distance was 30+ meters even though the location was properly displayed on the map?

		I am not sure, whether it is intended to work in that way: Today I did GC1Z71W. This cache has 10 waypoints (Stages of a Multi Cache). For all of them I added the coordinates in c:geo as I found them. Now I updated the cache-details and found, that all my modified waypoints are again replaced by the waypoints from gc.com (with empty coordinates). I think, this should not happen as the user might loose coordinates he needs for completing a multi-cache he already started, and I am quite sure that the behavior was different in older versions ?! I am using the RC-version downloaded 23.12.2011.

		Again something hard to describe. I had a cache (GC1Z71W) with some of the existing WPs modified (added coordinates to it) saved in c:geo. After upgrading the c:geo version to the newest RC (30.12. RC1) the saved waypoint have somehow multiplied (and saved as &quot;Personal Note x&quot;) with incorrect north-coordinates.Have a look at the screenshot: None of the personal notes was there before and it should only be something like 12 or 13 waypoints but not 30.

		A small glitch which becomes visible with the light skin (white background, black text): if the inventory page is available, it initially shows all list items white-on-white, so nothing is readable and only the list item dividers are drawn. After the user wipes over the list items they get painted properly and become visible. This seems to be an initial display problem.

		At least for me the &quot;Anywhere&quot; screen has been completely useless until now. I once had a look at it and didn't understand why I should use it, because my caching activities and waypoint management are much easier in the other activities. Only when I now merged a contribution, I investigated that activity a bit more in the code and then finally understood it has essentially nothing to do with geocaching at all. It is a pure navigation tool, which allows either direct coordinate input or a projection relative to the current point. Maybe I'm the only one who is stupid enough to not understand this activity on first glance, but I feel that it should be reworked to make it more easy to understand. The following ideas come to my mind, and I'd appreciate feedback: Remove the activity and rely on other compass applications which will implement that much better. Remove the activity and maybe pimp the waypoint editing features (the only thing missing there is creation of a waypoint from cache coordinates, as written in another issue). Rename the activity from &quot;Anywhere&quot; to &quot;Navigate&quot; (or some other label) to indicate the pure navigation aspect. (A counter argument might be that people may then confuse it with the navigation menu in the cache activities). If bearing and distance is given, the calculated coordinate should be visible below those fields (and change directly on inputting the numbers) instead of only calculating it when invoking the navigation tools. It is completely unclear which coordinates are used if I fill both the projection input fields and also give a coordinate using the top buttons. Can we somehow show that better? The workflow of the acitivity might be easier to understand if we have an explicit button below the input fields instead of starting everything from the options menu.

		This is related to issue #375: I used to disable GPS to save battery power on bigger trails and while its relatively easy to switch it back on, c:geo takes lots of time to notice that new coordinates can be queried. I wish there would be a &quot;query now&quot; or &quot;update now&quot; button in the compass or - which would be most preferred of course - enough intelligence that c:geo picks up new coordinates much faster than it does now. Most of the time its quicker to completely force quit the app, restart it and open the last cache than to wait for it to get new coordinates...

		When I'm on a quick caching tour somewhere I usually look on the live map, select a few caches (thanks to the new overlay mode that displays more info on the cache without that the details have to be opened!) and save them to the local list. What I'm now missing though is a small visual indicator that I already saved a particular cache, especially in regions with many caches, so I don't accidentially click on such a cache again and try to save it.

		I use the map view quite a lot to get a grasp of all available caches in an area. Especially urban areas however have many, many hotspots with hundreds if not thousands of caches. Rendering all these caches with big symbols is quite cumbersome because the labels overlap each other and don't provide the wanted information (for the search example &quot;I look for an area with many traditionals&quot;). On GC.com's map they have three or four zoom levels with different symbol sizes and information and IIRC only the lower two sizes are actually clickable (which is a good thing), while the other serve more of an &quot;overview&quot; purpose. I understand that this might not be something for people who do lots of single caches in the outback where the containers are farer away from each other, so maybe this could be something that can be switched on / off by a preference option?

Import 3 waypoints + cache should be displayed (if not, enable waypoint display in settings) tap multiple times on waypoint till c:geo says &quot;Sorry, c:geo failed to load waypoint&quot; The first times the waypoint should be displayed, normally after the third time i get this error message. Debugging i came to cgdata.loadWaypoint(int id) giving me a cursor != null and a count = -1.... I have no idea why it works most of the time and sometimes fails....

		I recently figured out that one can switch the default view to a map view when clicking on the navigate button in the overlay / details view. Thats fine and all, I usually use GMaps Terrain for a better overview where a cache is placed, but occasionally I still use the simple compass. Now when I set any map as default view, I apparently cannot switch back to the compass view, but I can reach any map view through the compass. It would be cool if the other way would work as well...

		I have seen this issue several times, but can not clearly say, under which condition it happens: I have a list containing my solved mysteries (where I have modified coordinates on gc.com). Initially they were all correctly stored (modified coordinates as cache-coordinates + additional waypoint with original coordinates). After some days I access the list again and find that the cache-coordinates are back to the original coordinates, and only after updating the caches from web again they are OK. My first assumption was, that if the caches are loaded on live-map (which might be the case), they are somehow overwritten by the original-coordinates. However I tried to reproduce this and I can see, that the cache-icon is shown on the wrong geolocation on live-map (the original coordinates) but after this the saved version was still OK. So two questions: Is it a limit of gc.com, that the coordinates on live-map are not my modified coordinates ? Might this cause the cache-coordinates to be reverted back to original in the saved-list ? Edit: Latest NB as well as new Market Release.

		Recently i figured out there seems to be no way to open a geocache from waypoint. The usecase is as follows: After finishing a cache we were looking for another cache near our position. On the live map i had a lot of final waypoints of mystery caches. I could open the waypoint but had no knowledge about the geocache it belongs to. It would be nice to be able to change to the geocache details view from the waypoint view.

		As pull request #921 is closed I think its suitable to open an issue for remaining problems: Stored OC-caches are always marked as not reliable (orange ring) on live map. I guess it is because the live-map can -of course- not verify the coordinates from gc.com. OC-caches should be removed from checking reliability because they are imported from PQs and should therefore be reliable in any case.

		As pull request #921 is closed I think its suitable to open an issue for remaining improvements: I would suggest to replace the marker for &quot;personal note available&quot; by a more meaningful icon. My personal favorite would be a &quot;small pencil&quot;. I have no experience in creating icons...so probably I can not help myself to solve it. So I just want to start the discussion and remind, that this should be done if others agree to it. Maybe there are some opensource-icons available which can be used for that ?

		I thought it is a mistake in #1008 that PATTERN_TRACKABLE_ID is now a regex for the GUID (e.g. 853acd4d-5a12-4c63-9afc-55afd2cbfe0e) and not the ID (e.g. 658003). But I looked at the mocked data, it was already before the latest changes. So our trackable-id is indeed a guid. Don't know if it can cause some problems.

		If I open the stored caches, the app tries to get the new location and resorts the listitems according to that. But this takes some seconds. If I have choosen an item before this is finished and choose &quot;delete&quot; for a cache it can end in a wrong deleted cache, because the order changed during this process. Although the Dialog shows the right cache title for what the operation should be done. It happened some times and i don't know what cache the app removed instead.

		Steps: Store some caches offline Filter the stored list, such as to just show multi-caches. Note that the bottom says &quot;No more caches&quot;. Click on one of the caches to view it Go back to the filtered list of stored caches. Note that the bottom now says &quot;Load more caches: currently: XX&quot; Click to load more caches Crash There are no more caches to load because I am looking at stored caches. The problem is in the calls to setMoreCaches in cgeocaches.java. It only compares the current list of caches against the search results. It doesn't account for any filters.

		The id of a (navigation-)app is based on it's name (see cgeo.geocaching.apps.AbstractApp.getId()). If the name changes (regular name change, fixing a typo or translation, changing the language) the id will change too. My first idea was to use the fqdn of the class, but then any refactoring would lead into the same issue. A solution might be a new enum, containing a value per app, and we always only add values to that enum, but never remove any.

		As discussed in some issues, people are asking about the calendar permissions. I'm working on a very small app (200 lines of code), which basically contains just the code for creating the calendar entry and can be invoked from the main app. There is no shared data model or anything like that, but just an intent invocation with several strings. That way we can easily decouple that use case from the main app and remove the permissions there.

		If the finish() call is removed from the onCreate method, which it must be because onCreate will continue executing while the dialog is being shown, then it must be added for positive and negative outcomes of the dialog. Steps to reproduce (after removing finish() from onCreate): View an event cache Click menu and then Add to calendar Click Back arrow Click menu again. Nothing will happen because the add on is still running, just without any window showing. Hitting back a second time will return control to c:geo. I will submit a pull request to fix this.

Only after opening the detail for a cache, returning to the search result and displaying the map again the specific cache is shown as reliable. Is there no possibility to check the reliability in the search or is the check just missing ?

		From a friend: I tried to use the search function on the top of the homescreen to log TBs I have found. The help-app says, this should work. However it seems only to be working if you use the public identifier of the TB but not with the secret code printed on the TB. This makes this special function quite useless, as usually I don't have the public code when I find a TB and try to log. It would save some clicks if I could just use the secret-code in search from the homescreen.

		I just tried out c:geo NB with a basic member account. If I have seen it correctly all the caches on live-map (except the caches stored on the device) will appear with non-reliable marker. I know, that the reliability can only be checked if the user is PM. Assuming that this functionality will go to the market, I guess that many basic-member users will not understand why the caches are marked as unreliable and will probably not like this feature or even don't trust the app anymore. The change to look-and-feel is to drastic. In fact in most cases the caches shown to basic-members will have reliable coordinates anyway, but we just cant detect that right now. I hope, that I understood the the working-mode of the reliable-check, if not please correct me and/or close this issue. After having seen the look-and-feel for basic-members I would like to suggest to think over the display of reliability in the following way: For premium members only mark unreliable by a orange-circle and reliable without marker (like currently implemented) For basic members only mark reliable by a green-circle and unreliable without marker Doing it in this way each type of user would only get notified by a marker in important cases on his user-perspective and not be overwhelmed by a lot of caches marked in some way. What do you think ?

			<description>
		While I started working on the preference activity, I found that we can avoid several issues there by first doing a refactoring of the existing settings, related to 2 points: We don't use the standard location to save the preferences, which makes it unnecessarily hard to get some things running at all (like the preference manager of the preferenceActivity). We sometimes use integer types for boolean preferences. As the preference activity expects boolean values for boolean preferences, this might lead to real problems. I have no clue whether it can deal with wrong data types or just looses the values when reading the preferences. Therefore I will first do a refactoring which cleans those 2 issues. Additionally it might be a good idea to externalize the preference key names into a String resource, because then we can access the names from code and from the preference activity XML declaration without duplication.

			<description>
		Imagine there are several similar caches located in a small area. All are saved in a list, but the names are long with a appending number. So they are hard to distinguish. On the map started from the list all look also the same because they are of the same type. Now during the cache tour every cache is logged offline as found (or DNF) and in the list they are marked. But on the map they look still similar. It would be an improvement to &quot;mark&quot; them also on the map. Maybe an overlay or a slightly changed color could do it.

		It should be possible to give custom waypoints also a type attribute. For a cache with only custom waypoints for parking, stages and final they are all displayed just as waypoint. At the map the waypoint could then also have the icon for parking or final.

		Imagine &quot;some&quot; solved unknown caches that are displayed on the map together with it's final waypoints. Because the finals don't have to be close to the cache it's hard to know what final waypoint belongs to which cache. A connection in the map between cache and waypoint could be a good way to show they belong together. Making the connections visible / invisible from the menu would be helpful too.

		When the Navigate menu is selected, the compass is displayed without being chosen. (My Default Navigation is set to Map) Steps: Open a list of caches (can be Stored or Nearby) Long press a cache to open the menu Select Navigate About the same time the menu is displayed, the compass will show up. Hitting back takes you back to the Navigate menu where you can then select something other than Compass. I thought this might have been due to refactoring by Bananeweizen in 9b0459d, but the previous commit has the same problem.

		Steps: Select Nearby from the main screen Long press on one of the caches in the list (that you have not looked at recently) Select either your default navigation or Navigate There is a delay before anything happens If I'm looking at the list and I select to show on the map via button in the top right, it is instant. So, the coordinates are already known. There should not be a delay when choosing to navigate to the cache. I haven't looked at the code, but it seems that it is either retrieving more information from the website or doing some other slow operation.

I made a PQs myself to test this thing out. If image is attached to a cache (like spoiler) there is no reference in GPX If image is displayed in cache there is a reference in GPX and we ca download it (with some yet unimplementef feature) What do you think?

		Since NB from 26.01. it appeared to me, that the logbook-page of stored cache are no longer available. Only after updating the cache, its available again but after a while (or restart of the app, or some other action) the logbook is again no longer shown in cache-details. Right now I can find a way to reproduce it but I am quite sure its a new issue in the nightly from yesterday (26.01.).

		As discussed in #1044, having an alert builder for the sub menu items of the navigation menu encapsulates the logic of the navigation menu much better and isolates the menu code from the code of the activities where it is used. There might be only one drawback I can currently imagine: Menus of an alert builder might potentially be rendered differently than menus of a context menu. Has anyone ever experienced something like that or can even prove that all those different menu items are rendered the same (Android documentation or the like?)

		Sometimes the search by address can give more results than expected, e.g. searching for &quot;Steinbach&quot; which exists multiple times in Germany. Several of those addresses are shown completely identical, e.g. &quot;Steinbach, Germany&quot;. It would be nice to have some further differentiation between those addresses. As there are in fact no more additional details in the address returned by the geocoder, we can probably only add current distance and maybe geographic direction (e.g. &quot;123 km SW&quot;).

		When I set &quot;Corrected Coordinates&quot; for a cache on the geocaching.com-website, c:geo can import it and display the cache with the new coordinates on the map. But when I store the cache, c:geo drops these new coordinates after some time (I guess 1-2 days) and replace it by the original ones. As workaround I have to refresh the cache shortly beforce I want to look for it. These bug exists at least for the last 2 versions (including the version &quot;2012-01-04&quot;) on Nexus S.

		I nearly always log offline and then use the PC afterwards for logging. For that use case it would be quite comfortable if the second line of the history list entries would not only contain date and time, but also the geocode, so you can more easily search the logged caches online (without opening each of those caches).

		From the Live Map view, some caches are failing to be stored for offline, and fail to download when 'more details' button is clicked. (a specific example is GC36EMW). Other caches in the area which are not 'Premium Member Only' are fine. Sometimes no error is shown when the cache has failed to store, the most specific information a message has given is 'communication error'. These caches also seem to temporarily disappear sometimes as the map moves and zooms. Full details of these caches can be viewed on geocaching.com.

		Today I went caching with NB3101 7fba2c2 and have seen the following issue reproducibly: I started Live Map and the caches are shown normal after (very short :-) ) loading time. When driving around (with my car) the map starts to scroll and at some point of course an update is performed. At the start of this reload (indicated by the progress indicator in the upper right) all caches disappear some seconds (depending on the network speed) until the reload is completed. After that the caches are again shown normal.

		Please look at the following code and give feedback. I summarized a few of my ideas for a better data-handling from the last weeks. // Cache &quot;GC23456&quot; is already present in the database. This will load it.
Cache cache1 = new Cache(&quot;GC23456&quot;).load();

// Now we can access it in the normal way.
cache1.getName();
cache1.getCoordinates();

// We don't need it any more, so delete it.
cache1.delete();

// Please note: cache1 still has all data (we might store it agein later)
// If you don't need the object anymore, give it to the garbage collector.



// Well, now we'll load a cache, that was never opened before.
Cache cache2 = new Cache(&quot;GC2AB45&quot;).load();

// This will load the cache automatically with the connector/adapter
// (internally selected in the ORM-driver).
// It is automatically added to an internal cache (not the one you're searching)

// Storing the cache is easy. Simply call
cache2.save();

// Now it's stored in the default list. But what, if we want another list?
cache2.setListId(22);
cache2.save();



// A big problem before was storing of whole lists of caches. This took ages
// because we stored every cache with it's own request. Each request is very
// expensive (remember: it's sqlite!).
CacheList list = new CacheList();
list.add(cache1);
list.add(cache2);
list.save();

// That's all! CacheList.save() uses e.g. prepared statements in the ORM-backend
// to merge all contained caches into a single request.

// Also mass-operations are possible. Imagine you want to add a list of caches to
// a specific list.
list.setListId(10); // calls the method for every contained cache
list.save();

// Please note: CacheList is _not_ the type of list that the user selects in
// c:geo (it's only a data model), but it can be used for it.

// Maybe we can also add lazy evaluation (CacheList.lazyLoad(20)), so that only the
// first 20 caches are loaded at the beginning and the remaining ones when they're
// used. Cache as well as CacheList are working with the ORM-pattern. Internally they access a static/singleton storage-layer, that bind's adapters for platform-connectors, different databases etc.

		In nightly builds, since a few days, when you refresh caches, waypoints disappear. In fact, they are only hidden, because if you add an extra WP, all missing WP becomes visible again.

		Just a minor thing: If you start c:geo after a fresh installation you will be directed to the user settings to enter your gc.com login. If you continue in the settings-menu and also restore an existing DB-backup while in this menu and go back to main menu, still the prompt appears telling you that the DB is empty and a backup is available.

		On yesterdays caching trip with NB0302 I had some problems with the offline-logging. I stored some offline logs (just typed a few words and pressed back). The toast message &quot;Log saved&quot; was shown. After that the following things appeared somehow randomly among the caches: The orange marker was not shown for all caches where I saved a log but for some it worked. If I deleted the offline log the orange-marker stays in the list for all caches where I have tried that After accessing the offline-log again (back in my warm car) and sending the log it gets marked green+orange in the list I assume its related to the latest changes, but I wanted to create a separate issue to test if it is fixed after the problems are solved.

		Hi, can you add hint to details window? Now it is located in Description window and it is not optimal... you have to move between windows and hint is located below the long text so you must scroll down long time... it is uncomfortable... You should add hint to details windows too... It would be great! Sorry for my bad english :) Thank you

		I encounter a strange behaviour with my self created cgeo with issue#285 label. When changing to details from list view the Cache seems not to be loaded fully including waypoints and logs. After I just added a waypoint (in offline mode) the cache seems to be loaded and all waypoints and log entries are there. So far I don't know if this is an issue, already fixed or appears according to CacheCache issue changes. Please check this.

		With the NB0902 83b215a there is a change in the progress window: If you load cache-details (from live map or from search result) the progress window is always showing &quot;Store for Offline&quot; as last prompt before the details are opened. I guess it is because it is stored in the cache-cache. But as the cache is not really stored for offline-use I suggest to avoid showing this prompt.

However, if the user has selected that they want to hide their own and found caches in the main options menu, this search returns nothing making it completely useless.

		Settings: Hide found caches Store a cache offline, that you've found (or log it as found) Open live map. Not found caches are displayed, included offline stored ones. Menu --&gt; disable live. Now only offline stored caches are displayed, but found caches, too. This is absolutely ok, if you display a list of offline stored caches. They are displayed there, too (but with a refactoring of the filters it would be good, if they are also hidden there, but that's another issue). But the live-map should behave like in live-mode.

When an event occurs and you want to perform a menu update, you must call invalidateOptionsMenu() to request that the system call onPrepareOptionsMenu(). There are some cases where we modify the menu (e.g. after updating a cache in the details-view).

		This issue is I think somehow related to #716. If I just continuously zoom out on live-map the behaviour is the following: At some zoom-level (I think depending on the number of caches or a limit from gc.com) no new caches will be shown but the caches from the last zoom-level stays on the map If you zoom out e.g. showing whole europe the icons start flickering and reloading is performed for a very long time (according to the progress indicator) With the &quot;old map&quot; AFAIR the caches just disappeared at some point when zooming out and no more loading was done. The current behavior looks somehow different and I don't know if this might cause high traffic to gc.com ?! A side-issue for this: If I zoom in again to a high zoom-level afterwards and scroll through the map, it won't load caches anymore. It behaves like offline (not trying to load from gc.com) Only If I switch off the update and on again, the caches are loaded.

		We have now two 'Spinners' (drop-down selectors) in c:geo (map source selection, waypoint type) and may get a third (units selection for projection). Currently these are in standard style. We should adapt them to our theme. I started this already for the waypoint type, but as this got quite involved I choose to make it a separate issue.

		I found two problems when editing waypoints, but i believe they are related to each other. I found this in the emulator. Don't know if it's easy to reproduce on a real device. The location is set to Longitude 13,8 and Latitude 51,3. When creating a new waypoint from current location in format DDD° MM.MMM the initial displayed value (grey text) is &quot;N 51 18.000&quot; and &quot;E 013 48.000&quot; (without °). But when opening the popup to edit the coordinates the north value is displayed as &quot;N 51° 17.1000&quot; ! (18.000 == 17.1000?) Create a new waypoint. The proposed value (from current location is X) Then click to change the coordinates to another value Y, press &quot;Done&quot; but not Save. Change the value again and the popup to edit the coordinates is initialized with value X (and not Y as expected).

		I'm running c:geo 04.01.2012 on Android 2.1 update 1 and the live map is not working as expected. When I load the live map, the throbber appears, then on cache icon with the [1] in the title but as soon as the loading finishes, they all disappear with the toast about partial data and inaccurate locations. Panning around the map will occasionally make another cache icon appear then disappear in the same way. This still occurs after an uninstall and reinstall from the market and re-entering my geocaching.com login details.

		First thanks for turning this nightly build out so quick after Groundspeaks mapping regression. The live map does grab and show up caches for the area now. However, it doesn't appear to know which caches a user has already found. About 1/2 of my smilies aren't showing up on caches that I've already found. Maybe it's now looking at the logs to determine this. When I click on them and look at the logs for ones that I've already found, the data is several months old. I've also tried setting it to 'exclude my own and found caches' it still shows those that I have found that didn't have a smiley as one would expect. Thanks and keep up the good work.

		I recently started geocaching, and have been using C:geo and really enjoy the program. However, I've ran into a problem. I used the app on my Droid X2 for about 2 weeks and recently it started giving me an error: &quot;Since c:geo is able to download only partial data, coordinates of caches could be inaccurate&quot;. I've reinstalled it and that still didn't fix this. Worked fine for a few weeks..but just started giving me this error. It only shows the caches I have on my watch list for about 1 second..then they disappear and I can't pull up any caches on the Live map. Any answers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Bryan

		This one is from email... So i noticed a new issue on the app. The settings that I've set up is to have maps as the default map source to make it easy to navigate. When I am in a cache detail page and want to view the cache on the map I hit menu and default navigation to open google map to view the location on the map. All I get is a blank map with no cache location. Ok no problem I go back into the setting and change the default map back to radar and go back to a cache detail page. I then click menu and navigation then map to load google maps. I then am able to see the cache location. Kinda weird that it is viewable in one setting but not the other. Thanks for the great app.

		I would like to add a save action to our shared settings for the formatter, so that control statements are always reformatted as block. So instead of if (changed)
    notifyChanged(); I would always like to have if (changed) {
    notifyChanged();
} To me the second version is much more fault tolerant regarding later changes of the code (e.g. adding a second statement to the then-block). Any objections to having this as shared setting?

		This is not always reproduceable. I think it depends on if cache is in CacheCache or DB, etc. Steps: View a cache that has trackables View one of the trackables Click on the &quot;Spotted in&quot; to search for the cache (in this case it will be the same cache we are already viewing) Sometimes you can get IllegalArgumentException (geocode must not be empty) from cgData.loadCache I was never able to reproduce this if I started off by searching for a trackable (vice starting off in a cache).

		As already mentioned in the initial disscussion of #868 most users not only have one preferred navigation tool. It's the same for me and i was looking for a solution that doesn't pollute the menus nor the action bar, but enables fast access to a second navigation tool. My proposal is to add a second preference for such a second tool. Just a short text explaining how to access it and a spinner to choose the tool like for the first one. Access to the tool is only available via long click at the action bar navigation icon wherever it exists. Currently this will be in the cache details, cache popup (from map) and the waypoint activity. I guess this will improve the navigation handling a lot. What do you think about it? The code is almost complete and i can provide it soon so you can have a look at it and maybe give it a try ...

		The QR code scanner only works with strings that start with http://coord.info/. It does not work if you scan a QR code that is just a GC code or a TB code. The error presented if I scan just a geocode is &quot;Didn't find any geocode in the scan result.&quot; At the very least, the error message should be changed to explain that only scanning http://coord.info/ links will work. I think the best behavior would be to show what was scanned along with the error message. I found a cache today that had a QR code so I scanned it (thinking it would load information about the cache). I just kept getting error messages from c:geo. I finally used my phone's barcode scanner and determined the QR code was just for http://www.geocaching.com I don't want to turn c:geo into a full QR code scanner, but it needs to be clearer what the program is doing and why it might not be working (after all, you usually have no idea what a QR code says when you are scanning it).

		Over support email: Thanks for the great and very useful app. I was wondering whether you might consider adding the static maps as a screen next to the log screen. In other words, screen 1 is waypoints, screen 2 is the cache details, screen 3 is the screen description, screen 4 is the log screen, and screen 5 would be static maps if you downloaded them, or if you haven't, a button to download. cheers

		As a cache owner it is possible to let a cache have another visible owner name than the real user name. Cgeo cannot currently open details for the cache owner in this case. Look at my cache GC15593 for an example. Clicking on the user name will open a menu, but it is not displaying the real user name. When I wrote this feature for about a year ago I introduced &quot;ownerReal&quot; in cgCache. This variable was given value from the link &quot;other caches hidden&quot; below the cache description.

		Requesting the needed informations in the Live Map takes somes seconds. It is not clear/visible to the user when the requests are finished esp. in case of an error. If no caches are shown: are the requests still outgoing ? Or are there just no caches around ? With the start of searchByViewport() i'd like to start the indicator, with the return i'd stop it. My idea is to use an counter because there can be more than one call to searchByViewport() at the same time.

		After playing around with the new live map in NB2402 - a221f3a I see some strange behaviour in the interaction with already stored or cached (opened before) caches. Right now I have no clear view but here are some occurences I have seen: Caches (with ?) on livemap are sometimes shown reliable (no orange marker) This may depend if the cache has been opened before but I could not clearly reproduce this Icons in my stored caches list are replaced by ? after having them viewed once on the live map. Only after opening the cache from the list the icon is shown again afterwards in the list. Found marker in lists gets lost after the certain cache has been viewed on the live map. Only after opening the cache from the list the found-marker is shown again afterwards in the list. Stored caches with personal note available, and final coordinates set are sometimes shown as ?-caches on the live map but with marker for note and final (and also on the final position).

		The popup after clicking on a cache in live-map is sometimes very small so that scrolling is needed to access all information. I guess this is caused by a combination of a short cache-name and the fact, that the section &quot;Save for Offline&quot; is missing.

		Now that we have the possibility to translate several fields of a cache, it would also be nice to invoke arbitrary apps with those texts (maybe a different translation app, the mail app, ...). Therefore we should have another menu item in that context menu of text fields similar to the &quot;Send to&quot; menu of the cache itself (using &quot;text/plain&quot; as mime type in this case).

		Hi, I guess I found a new bug, on the aplication. I will explcain who it ocures: I use cgeo on municipality A, with data and gps enabled; Turn off cgeo; I go on road trip to municipality B, (like 200kms betwin A and B); Once in B I turn on the GPS and start cgeo. Open live map, it shows me municipality A, I just think: &quot;Yeah, GPS is not fix yet. Gonna wait a little bit.&quot; A few minutes later GPS fixes position (the status bar icon stops blinking) The live map jumps to a municipality C, I was like, wtf?!?! Wait a little but, nothing, the only thing who's work was the accelerometer. Turn cgeo, turn on again, in the first page it show me &quot;municipality A&quot; and the map still on A too. Turn data On, nothing changes. Close cgeo again, and now with data and GPS ON (but not fixed yet), the municipality and map go to B. (where I was) I guess my issue is a bit long and probably messy (like my english) please ask me if you don't understand something. Greats

			<description>
		The finalDefined flag is not persisted correctly. To reproduce: Store an unmodified cache (without GC edited coordinates) for offline use. Add a final waypoint. -&gt; Cache is shown with flag in cache list, everything ok. Close and kill c:geo (a simple close is not enough to get rid of the process in memory). Restart and open the list containing the cache -&gt; Flag is gone, finalDefined=false. Open cache details, go back -&gt; Flag is there, finalDefined=true. To my understanding the reason is the following: The flag is set when a waypoint is added. Therefore it is correct after adding a final waypoint or after loading all waypoints from the database. But the flag (which was set on adding a waypoint) never gets stored, because the cache itself does not get stored after adding a waypoint. Therefore it is not correct after running a new c:geo instance, where only the cache details without waypoints have been loaded. A possible solution would be to store the cache after modifying waypoints but that may have other bad side effects (like data usage when caching in the wild).

		Currently this new feature is only used for the action bar. For intuitive use it should also be available on long click in the cachedetail menu and maybe also represented by another icon in the background. I like this feature because I use radar and map equally but I almost never use the actionbar to start the activity but the menu.

		Edit: Update title to match the remaining issue With NB2802 - b2d7a2b I had the following problem: Some caches (not all) I have already found where not marked with the smiley-icon on the live map. When clicking on the icon the popup shows it as &quot;Found&quot;, so the information seems to be available but not used in the live-map. It is not reproducible, meaning if I open the live-map again the situation changes or even the problem disappears. The rate is approx. 1 out of 30 for me which is not marked.

		Since a while I have a phone with Android 2.3.6 which allows enabling/disabling GPS very easily from the status bar. I now have it disabled by default (so Facebook and other apps can not track my position), but always forget to activate it for c:geo and then wonder why the position is not updated. We really need to have a check in the tool whether or not GPS is enabled (at least when entering the map) and to notify the user or to activate it by ourselfes then. Not sure if there are duplicates for this, I didn't find one with the quick search.

		Issue #1122 brought up a fix for the send2cgeo button on the new map. But this updated script hasn't been published on the web page yet. I've noted that a discussion has been started how to automate the distribution of script updates in issue #1136 . But that discussions hasn't come to an end yet. Therefore I suggest that - for the time being - the script is uploaded to the web page and users are informed (manually, e.g. website, facebook, ...) that they should update the script. This should bring them the functionality back again.

		c:geo version 16.02.2012 device: Sony Xperia Play Android 2.3.4 When I try to log a found cache and add a signature date and time are added just fine. Only the number stays empty. My template looks like this: '# [NUMBER] added a starting quote only here to avoid some formatting [DATE] [TIME] Is there a setting / config file where I have to fill in the starting number ? because I already found 80+ caches before using c:geo I already tried: Add number manually, number stays empty Add date manually: works (for the date) Add signature automatically: everything except number was added Googled, found some older issues, no solution FAQ: nothing about [number] Changed profile settings at Geocache.com (changed language dutch / english) maybe because &quot;gevonden&quot; / &quot;found it&quot; which as I understand triggers the number + 1 : no result Log online / offline: number stays empty Tried a template without the &quot;#&quot; at the beginning (start remark in some scripts) update c:geo to version 16.02.2012

		With NB0503 - 12e87a9 I have seen the following twice up to now but not reproducible: A cache is loaded at the outer range of the live-map (with unknown cache-type at first) I move in to this location and the live-map is refreshed At the end I have two icons representing the same cache: The unknown icon stays, the correct icon on the reliable coordinates is still shown besides it. If I click on one of them, the exact same information is shown in the popup (including the correct cache-type) Please see this example where the unknown-icon and the mystery-icon actually are the same caches. As you see also after zooming in and refreshing by moving the map the problem stays. The problem disappeared after closing and reopening the app. I don't know if closing and reopening the map solves it (did not try).

		my c:geo version is 03.01 RC2, running on a Samsung Galaxy SII with Gingerbread 2.3.3 When I select &quot;Import GPX&quot; from the Import menu c:geo scans my complete SD card (actually both cards because the SII has internal storage which gets mounted as &quot;sd&quot; card and place for an second card as well). Scanning all that storage takes 5-10 minutes. I'd like to set the directory c:geo looks into for PQ's, usually I am pretty well aware where I (actually, the dropsync client) put my PQs on the SD card.

		I'm confused by our database code. Sometimes it uses transactions, sometimes not. I cannot really see a pattern there and therefore don't understand it. I always thought that if we only issue one database command (and therefore have nothing else which might get into an inconsistent state), then it is not necessary to wrap this in a transaction. Therefore I would go and remove transaction support in methods like clearSearchedDestinations(), just as there is already no transaction in dropList(). Does someone else have more insights? The Android documentation is quite thin here...

		After you tapped a cache on the new live map to see its name or other details, the tiles for the current viewport are reloaded completely, although the viewport did not change at all. If we release that, we cause to much traffic at the GC servers.

		With NB1103 I have seen a lot of &quot;jumping&quot; cache-icons (marked as reliable all the time) on the live map. To that time I used the &quot;speed dependent&quot; strategy, which seemed to cause it. On the start I was not moving so the map was filled with the nearby search, then I started driving and the cache positions started &quot;jumping&quot;. Trying to reproduce this, I found the following way: Use &quot;detailed&quot; strategy to populate the map You will get the reliable results from the nearby search (as PM) Change the strategy to &quot;fast&quot; and force update of the map (e.g. by moving a little) Result: Some of the reliable icons may change their position on the map (to a wrong position) Result of nearby search (coords verified with website): Result after update with fast-mode (the multi has moved to a wrong position) :

		With NB1103 I have seen some caches having a strange icon. Unfortunately again this is not reproducible. I don't know whether this is a problem with the icon overlay itself or maybe there is another cache-icon for the same cache below it. If this are two cache-icons it is just the problem mentioned in #1232. What do you think ? Please refer to the screenshot, with one multi and one mystery with a half-smile:

		A feedback of some friends who are using the nightly builds: I import a lot of gpx-files with quite high amount of caches (sometimes up to 500). The import is OK with the new version but it takes ages because it downloads static-maps which I use only rarely. I would like a setting to switch it off for gpx-import to save time. If I switch off the general setting for static-maps I can also not use them for all other caches and I am also not asked whether I want to download them on access. I think a lot of users will run into this &quot;problem&quot; and in addition the Map-API will give up after 1000 requests (which is easy to reach already with 200 caches also containing some waypoints). Therefore I would suggest to have a separate setting for static map loading while importing a gpx.

		During live-map operation (fast strategy) I had some caches (all not stored and unreliable) where I got the message 'c:geo konnte den Cache nicht finden.' (or something similar) if I clicked them. This was reproducible for the specific caches as long as the map was open. After closing the map and reopening it was back to normal.

		From Bonemaro. Steps: Go to History view Long press on an entry and select Drop or Move to Other List NPE occurs when the code tries to refresh the list (after drop or move completed) Crash is from cgeocaches.switchListById because app.getList return a null list. I think the fix can just be check for null list and return if present. We don't actually need to reload the history list as dropping a cache or moving to another list doesn't affect the history list. (On a side note, it might be confusing because the user is not actually dropping from history list or moving from history list, but I like the functionality present there as it allows easily taking action on all caches you have found)

		Hello, Is possible to implement some option for exporting caches (from Stored) to Locus? I know I can send them to Locus using Menu-Show on map-Locus. But it doesn't save them to Locus' database so it's not possible to use some features for them (such as downloading map around caches or displaying 161 m circles)... I found that if I cachange last parameter in DisplayData.sendData function (AbstractLocusApp.java, line 81) to true, Locus asks for saving caches - that's exactly what I need. So it'll be great if you'd add something like Menu-Show on map-Export to Locus. It wouldn't be that difficult, wouldn't it? Thank you! BTW I asked author of Locus about saving these temporary caches and he replied me it would be very complicated and easiest way is to ask you for implementing this straight to c:geo.

		As mentioned in #1273 I still think that the query for the live-map is done for a much higher area than actually needed to fill the viewport. Maybe I understood something wrong, but if this can be limited somehow it would be Easier do to the PNG-parsing as the zoomlevel for map-requests could be higher Limit the loading time Here is my example: Starting the live-map with all default after clean install I get the following result: (Look at the title bar 32/403): If I zoom out you will see that the initial request covers a much too huge area:

		I have noticed that added waypoints never seem to go away. Steps: Store a cache Add waypoints to it Drop the cache (it moves to list ID 0) Wait at least 3 days without accessing that cache (so that the it drops from the database) View the cache again The waypoints are still there While this could be considered a feature, it means the waypoints database just gets bigger and bigger (and probably logs, images, trackable, etc too). I think the problem is in clean function in cgData. It is the one the removes the caches after 3 days. It is using RemoveFlag.REMOVE_CACHE which looks to me that it only removes it from the cache cache and not the database. I believe it should be REMOVE_DB. Can anyone second check this?

		Using NB1703. We were driving on the freeway (~100km/h). This speed was reported correctly at the bottom of the main-screen. When entering LiveMap and selecting speed-dependent-strategy then (and maybe for other strategies as well) the speed is displayed in the title-bar. The speed displayed in title bar was ~25-30km/h. It feels like this is rather m/s, maybe a multiply by 3.6 is missing?

		Steps: Load a cache (from search or stored) View cache on map (I am using Google maps, but should not matter) Note that [1] is shown in title bar Move the map around so that the cache gets near edge of screen As you keep moving map around, the count will keep increasing each time cache is reloaded I'm not sure that the cache should be continually reloaded from DB, but that is a different issue. The problem is from the introduction of LRUList in 771dc28 by @blafoo. Previously, a set was used so when CGeoMap line 1154 calls caches.addAll(search.getCachesFromSearchResult(LoadFlags.LOAD_WAYPOINTS)); it prevented duplicates from being added. But, LRUList is based on ArrayList which does not handle duplicates. I'm not sure if best method is to make LRUList based on set or clear caches before calling addAll (which might introduce other problems - I haven't looked).

		Today with NB2003 - 7212666 I had this problem: I was driving on the autobahn with the live map open (speed dependent) and suddenly I got this picture. It stayed all the time and the progress indicator was loading endlessly. It might be, that I had some problem with the internet connection to that time. The app was still responsive and I was able to move around the map. Also my position and trail was updated normal but no new caches shown anymore. Maybe its some problem with the mapsforge map ? I happened to me only this single time and is not reproducible.

		I found a bug, but I don't know exactly how to reproduce it. It happened often enough to discover a few symptoms. Here's what I did: I had a multi-type cache stored on c:geo (http://coord.info/GC2TDT1) I modified the cache coordinates on www.geocaching.com and sent it to send2cgeo On the phone I chose Import -&gt; from web, the cache downloaded again Reference point with original coordinates were added - that was good Original coordinates stayed the same, modified coordinates WERE NOT stored. Only after refreshing the cache a few times, the modified coordinates finally showed up. Maybe it's somehow related when requests for static maps get blocked by google, after you make too many requests, but I don't think that's the case. Anyhow, sometimes it seems that the refresh or re-download operation fails, so modified coords are not recognized. I almost went for a walk in the totally wrong direction, but I suspected something was wrong. Any ideas?

		Hello! I just recently tried to download some offline maps as described in the faq. Meaning I followed the link to the mapsforge site, downloaded a pre-made *..map and placed it in a folder (named /Maps). Autosearch worked fine, and I clicked in the menu on &quot;OSM:offline&quot;. However, when actually offline, no maps show up (everything works in online mode). No error message is printed. I checked the region of the map, the region of the cache I want to display and also downloaded other map files, but cannot figure out the source of the problem. Is there anything else I can report for tracking down this issue? Greetings, Puray

		If I load some cache and then I use &quot;Store for Offline&quot; from menu, cache already stored aren't refreshed. I can verify it entering in a cache details and reading how much time occurred from the last refresh. I've version 16.02.2012.

		I can't get the nightly build version running (tested 2303), I get a FC as soon as I click on any button, only &quot;About&quot; is working. I saw you have done a lot of good work, but I can't enjoy it :( Android 1.6 running on Archos 5 Internet Tablet Latest known c:geo version running is the current market version (04.01.2012).

		If I e.g. use the http://coord.info/... link to open a cache in c:geo I sometimes but not always experience that c:geo is started and downloads the cache details (progress window shown) and instead of displaying the cache afterwards exits with &quot;c:geo konnte diesen Cache nicht finden&quot;. Also from the app gcwatch (with AFAIK uses the GUID to address the cache) the same happens. If I try again with the same link the cache is displayed immediately (no loading) without problems. So it seems downloading is OK but it does not manage to open the detail-view. This behavior started somewhere mid of 03/2012 and is still there with NB2303/RC version. My example: http://coord.info/GC18BDH

		I can consistently reproduce this on my phone, but not on any emulator. I've verified my phone does it with current build and with current market version. Request if anyone else can reproduce. Settings: Map is default navigation (but it is reproduceable if Compass is default and then Show on Map) I am using Google Maps Steps: View caches on the map (can be live map or stored caches) Click a cache to open the popup Click navigate button in the top right corner of the popup When the map comes up with just the one cache, move it around some so that new tiles load Go back to the previous map and move it around some so that new tiles load I then experience the map will stop loading and I get tons of the following in the log W/System.err(2058): at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1096)

		Issue can be reproduces by: opening a multi-cache that contains mutliple waypoint-entries with coordinates (e.g. http://coord.info/GC1TH7Y) selecting Navigate-Map from the waypoints screen change orientation of the device In the changed orientation, only the Icon of the main cache will be displayed, the other waypoints disappeared. Imho a minor issue, as selecting a specific waypoint and displaying on the map works as expected.

		I have seen several posts on FB stating that after installing the RC-version the hiding of found caches does not always work although the relevant setting-option is active. Here is an example: There's a switch Exclude found and own which I have checked. Not all caches that I have found but the most of the caches that I have found still show up with the smiley. I have gone into these caches and they were logged by me. When I first look at the screen they are not there but a few seconds later (about 10) they show up. I notice as i zoom in or out is when this happens. Hope this helps. I can not reproduce this by myself. Is it possible that this problem appears when upgrading from market-version to RC-version only for some reason ?

		I noticed a very annoying bug on my HTC Desire S device. Every time c:geo loses focus, e.g. switched to another app or the phone lock due to manual lock or display timeout, I need to relaunch c:geo. This can be done either by &quot;relaunching&quot; the app or by holding the home button and select c:geo. In the latter c.geo display the last displayed activity. In the former c:geo goes back to its dashboard and I have to reopen the page displayed before. This is very annoying. I expect c:geo to display exactly the activity which has been active before screen lock or app switching. Seems to affect all versions, current markt, rc and nightly.

		For the case of the preview map being this large red cross, it would be really nice to have a context menu to just refresh that preview map.I know I can refresh the compete cache, but sometimes my data rate may be so bad that this is much easier and faster...

		Today while collecting solved mysteries with the newest RC I have seen the following problem: I stored caches on my list containing modified coords from the website. The stored cache information is correct (WP for original coords, cache at modified coords). When I map the location or open the live map the cache is sometimes shown at the original coords instead of the modified coords. I suspect it is an issue with merging the data coming from the map with the offline data from the DB.

		One aspect that I still get a lot of static code analysis warnings for is our use of unbuffered IO. We often do not wrap streams or readers into their buffered version. On normal Java applications this should basically always be done to improve performance. Does anyone have more insight on how this relates to Android? I did not find any good article on that.

  for (final cgWaypoint wp : listOfWaypoint) {
    if (wp != null) {
      …

  }
} Most of the time, the list cannot contain null. And most of the time, the list cannot be null. There are a lot of places where we could cleanup the code by removing useless null checks.

		When using the &quot;fast&quot; strategy in Live Map, found caches show up even though displaying found caches is disabled in the options. To reproduce: Open live map. Select menu-&gt;strategy-&gt;fast Go to area where you have found caches. Desired outcome: Found caches do not show up. Actual outcome: Found caches are displayed. UPDATE: Observed on c:geo version: Market version 02.04.2012. Android version: 4.0.3 (ICSSGS RC4.2) Phone: Samsung Galaxy S GT-I9000.

		Currently c:geo defaults to the DD/MM/YYYY date format when displaying cache info and logs. It would be better if it did one of the following (sorted by descending desirability): Use the geocaching.com date format. Use the system date format. Offer a configuration option for date format. C:geo already knows the user's geocaching.com selected date format (otherwise it would not be able to parse log dates), so it would be a trivial change to use the same date format for formatting date output as well.

		With the availability of NFC chips to new phones as well as the cheap cost of NFC tags, it would be cool to enable cache owners to add an NFC tag which can be scanned to log the find. Functionally this would work very similar to the QR code scanning currently supported - but more passive.

		With the current market release more details when opening a cache popup are only requested if the cache type is unknown. From my point of view it would be an improvement also to request the data if the popup is opened for caches which already have a parsed cache type icon, because: It will deliver the D/T rating and cache size It will deliver the favorite points (but currently this is not used for the popup anyway) We would be able to confirm or correct the cache type (if parsing went wrong) Let's say you are using the live map to look for an appropriate cache to go for, then this information would be very useful and it will probably be faster than having to download every cache.

		And a new time-schedule issue :-) What about the next releases... I suggest to close the old milestone (and thus remove the flag from the issues) and create two new milestones to sort the issues: Bugfix release Next normal release Bugfix would then be everything which can be fixed easily or high-prio issues with the goal to release it in 3-4 weeks. What do you think ? Edit: Have just seen that master and release have been synced now (so I removed one passage of my posting).

		Hi. Am i the only one unable to see the long descriptions with today's update? I've tried several caches, and only the short description appears in c:geo, rendering it unusable for most of them. I've tried to erase the caches, reload them, load new caches that were not in my stored list: unsuccessful. Running HC 3.1 on a rooted Acer Iconia Tab A500 if that matters.

			<description>
		Sometimes after updating the c:geo app, the live map &quot;resets&quot; its location to the same place in between Göttingen and Erfurt in Germany. I live in Denmark and have never been anywhere near this location - with or without my phone. I have never done any searches in the area or imported pocket queries within that area. It has also happened upon other occations. I have not noted exactly which events cause this. If this is essential to locating the bug, I will try to be more observant of when exactly this bug occurs.

		(This is a fork of another issue into a feature request. See: cgeo#1368 for details.) As described in the abovementioned issue, the initialization of the live map behaves differently depending on whether you use Google Maps or OSM. Google Maps defaults to the last known (or viewed) position, whereas OSM defaults to some map-default location, somewhere in the middle of Germany. The map initialization should, in my opinion be (in order of relevance): If &quot;center map on current location&quot; is activated and the location service has a fix, fix the map there (if the preference is on, but there is no fix, proceed - the map will relocate once fix has been obtained) If the location service is off, the &quot;center map on current location&quot; is not selected or the location service has not yet obtained a fix on location, use the following, in the order selected by the user in a user settings: Last known position (persists from last time used - skip if live map has never used before) Home location (user setting - skip if none set) If all of the above fails, let library use its default value.

		I remember the discussion about the cache list. Yesterday I tried to move a cache from one list to another. A tap opened the context menu, but in the background the list sort order changed because of my position. This results in the wrong item moved to a different list. We should do context menu actions just by the GC-Code. Is this possible?

		I need a method to send multipart POST requests (to upload files) like Network.postRequest(). It's too bad that Android does not have a good http client library (and don't say that the Apache HTTP Client is a good library, also some parts are missing). I'll be very glad if somebody can help me and implement such a method in the Network-class.

		One thing, I always wanted to ask for, is this &quot;heading line&quot; on the map between the current position and the target position (cache, waypoint). I'd find that very helpful. In fact, this is one of the very few features of the official app, I'm missing in c:geo.

But after viewing the cache's details and navigate to the cache it is still orange. This makes absolutely no sense. I can't find an option to navigate to the exact coordinates! Thanks!

			<description>
		From email: Hello, There were some functions working in the previous revisions, which are not working now (02.04.2012 revision). Issue: updating stored cache lists not working properly. Start program - Stored - (a stored list of caches opens) - Menu - Manage - Refresh All. It supposingly refreshes the stored list. If I logged my cache as &quot;found&quot; using my PC computer, this function used to add a green vertical line next to the cache name and add a &quot;smiley&quot;. Now it does not do it. It does not update the cache status to &quot;found&quot;, either. It refreshes the logs, but that's it. Start program - Stored - (a stored list of caches opens) - Menu - Select mode - (selecting a few caches) - Menu - Manage - Refresh selected. Same story as above. No green line, no &quot;smiley&quot;, no &quot;found&quot; status on the cache main description page. However, after entering (&quot;clicking on&quot;) the stored cache main page and hitting the &quot;refresh&quot; button, the cache status is updated to &quot;found&quot; and after leaving back to the stored list, the green line is back and the &quot;smiley&quot; (on the map) as well at this cache only. Please, fix.

		Reading over the changes for the unpersonal speech in one of the last commits, I found that we sometimes refer to &quot;mobile&quot; in the UI texts. As c:geo can also be used on tablets and other Android devices, it might be nice to rework those strings to refer to &quot;device&quot; or a similar term instead. Any suggestions beside &quot;device&quot; (german: &quot;Gerät&quot;)? And more precisely, better to use &quot;this device&quot; or &quot;the device&quot;?

		Hi, I don't know, if this was already here (I couldn't find it) but I would really appreciate, if you would to build in a function/button for refreshing all caches on the Live map: The Problem: I have stored a aprox. 1 year ago all caches few kilometers around the place I live. in this time, some of them didn't exist anymore, or the stored ones have and old logbook. now I need to Refresh them all, but I don't want to refresh them one-by-one. I have here aprox. 300 cashes around and it would be very time consuming. It would be great, if I have a button, and all the cashes on the Live map screen would be refreshed. I think this isn't a big deal to build in this function. What do you think ? Sorry for my english :)

		While working on the mapsforge 0.3.0 switch and the integration of backwards-compatibility support for mapsforge 0.2.4 I asked myself if it is really worth the effort. One thing is, that due to the derivation-based API even more code needs to be duplicated to support 0.2.4 and 0.3.0 in parallel (and maintained in duplication). The other thing is, that I would assume that the most people have no problem with just downloading the up-to-date map from mapsforge, especially when they actively get notified that the mapfile is invalid for the current mapsforge version. I'd like to get your thoughts on this before proceeding with implementing support for both versions.

		Last week I got the chance to introduce c:geo to three new users. All of them tried at first to close the live map popup by clicking on the map in the background instead of pushing the back button. It seems that this is the most intuitive way on a touchscreen. Therefore it would be good if both operations could be supported to close the popup.

However, if you go back to the cache list activity and reenter the cache details activity for the same cache, it will say that your cache is not in your watchlist while it is.

		Since some weeks in the NBs the popup from live map is closed right after selecting &quot;Save&quot;. (It seems the saving is now done in the background). Thats quite OK, because it does not block the app during the cache download. However the icon of the cache to be saved is not updated afterwards. It stays marked unreliable, does not &quot;jump&quot; to the precise coordinates and the disk-overlay is not shown. You have to close and reopen or reload the map to make the change visible. @rsudev: That's the issue I talked about on IRC some days ago.

		Currently when adding waypoint &quot;name&quot; if before &quot;type&quot;. When you start typing a name &quot;Sta&quot; Autocomplete offers &quot;stages of multi-cache&quot;, however type stays Reference point. My idea is to move &quot;type&quot; before &quot;Name&quot; and when user changes type and name is still empty the name be filled with default text. What do you think?

		A nice enhancement would be to get the name of the waypoint (if there) instead automatically naming them &quot;Personal note X&quot;. wp1: N 49° 6.707 E 009° 13.829 final= N 50° 6.808 E 009° 13.829 Format could be Name:coords or Name=coords or Name coords. In cGCache.parseWaypointsFromNote, the regex could become something like this \b([^\s]\s[:=])?([nNsS]{1})\s*\d and name could be retrieved from group 1, coords from group 2. if no group1 then default name could be used.

		I just downloaded latest (0424) nightly version and I noticed, that there was some menu reorganisation on cache lists. There is small problem with new/empty lists - it is not possible to import anything to them (at least I didn't find that option - only filter and list &quot;buttons&quot; are visible after pressing menu). there is no problem if there is at least one cache already on the list (additional buttons appear).

		Obviously Gps averaging takes many Gps points and averages them to give an accurate fix. People use it to set accurate coordinates when hiding caches. There's an ap If you are a geocacher this should be familiar. You arrive at or near a cache location and your phones Gps is not accurate by as much as 10 to 20 meters. (Especially in trees or canyon effect.) Why not offer a switch on the c:geo compass which you use when near to a cache. Switch averaging on and don't move the phone. The user will get an accurate distance and bearing to the cache. The user could move to the location and re average to home in. In a nut shell you would make c:geo the most accurate search geocache application on the market. I think you should give this consideration. Please can you give me some feed back Regards chris

		It used to work before, but it seems that now it doesn't work anymore: I have a few caches stored for offline, then I log a visit online (found it/write note/whatever), and the log, after it was posted, was shown in the logbook of the stored cache. Or at least it was there if it was still in history. Now it's not there, unless I refresh the cache. This function was very handy for mass drop of found caches...

		When on the map you can open a waypoint and get it's details, but you can not navigate to it's &quot;parent&quot;. I want to implement that and I'd like feedback. How about a bar above/below the waypoint info with the cache info? Just a plain button in line with &quot;Edit&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot;? I favour the bar above the waypoint type and name.

		I have downloaded caches from various cities in Germany. When I want to view all the caches on a map, I always get the entire map zoomed out. It's kind of annoying to zoom in to my particular location first. It would be nice if I can apply a filter in the map screen that includes only offline caches within a specific distance, say 3-5km. This could be implemented as a new filter, because the filtering mechanism (for example by cache type) works pretty well already with offline-stored caches.

		Yesterday on my way to solve issue #1364 i found out that: waypoint navigation menu is created on the fly cache navigation menu is created a static way both methods use 2 booleans to filter out 2 menu items cache always shows static maps item although there is no static map waypoint shows static map item only if one is existing So we should refactor this behaviour to: create waypoint and cache navigation both on the fly and kick one method change boolean parameters to a List filter only show StaticMaps entry if existing On my branch I changed the cache method to take a filter list. This seems to be better and more flexible. Any comments?

		I was out caching this weekend using latest build with GPS turned off (using Network for position). I noticed that when I click a cache on the map, often the popup window would open with distance as &quot;--&quot; (the default) and stay that way for up to 30 seconds. I believe this was introduced in 5a10f40 (observer pattern). I think maybe the problem is that cgeopopup is registering for location updates, but no update is getting fired for some period of time (likely longer since I was using Network and not GPS). Sometimes if I wait till it shows a distance, then open other popups from the map, then they will have a distance right away, but sometimes they still don't. I have reproduced this with GPS turned on as well.

		It's only a very minor thing, but I suggest to remove the &quot;1 x published&quot; output from the cache details, as this really has no value for the user. Every other counter gives a clue of how active the cache or the cache owner are, but this one seems very useless and just consumes screen space. What's your thoughts on that?

		I created a new list in order to import caches from the web using send2cgeo. The 'import' option was not available. It appears the import option has moved under 'manage'. With a blank list, options available are filter and list. 'filter' has no purpose if the list contains no entries. As a work around, I moved a cache to the empty list, and was then able to import caches. I am using nightly build ver. 2504-faa78b

Caches are no longer sorted by distance (I think they are now by geocode). This happens also if you sort by anything, then view details of a cache and go back to the list. It will not be in the order it was in before.

		Hi, I'm using c:geo offline very often, so I send caches to c:geo via send2cgeo and then go geocaching in terrain. I'm using lists by location where I'm. But sometimes I go for caches in the same places. I've new and old caches in one list and it's not easily possible to show only new caches. So sometimes I try to hunt some caches which are some months only in my phone. I will be happy when I can click in list &quot;Delete caches older than 30 days&quot; for example.

		Extract from support mail: Why is it I can't do the same with the .gpx that I download from waymarking.com Essentially, its the same data in the same format, but they will not load into c:geo. It asks if I want to import them then states that 0 (zero) caches were imported. If they could be identified with a little W symbol, I could load all my intended caches, waymarks and benchmarks for trip, and could then see them as they approach during my drives.

After enabling network access again the map is loaded and keeps loading although I disabled network again afterwards. This is NOT a problem of fallback to online map, because once the map is shown I can disable network again and can still pan around on the map through germany.

		If a nearby search is performed by a basic member he will get the distance graphics only (unless he enables the re-captcha) and only basic information of the caches. People are often complaining, that e.g. &quot;sort by distance&quot; is not working in this case because it is still selectable but has no effect although they see the distance on the screen. First of all I thought about disabling the sorting by distance in this case (if technically possible). Same would apply for other sorting options which are not available in this case (e.g. D/T, Size, etc.). But as the distance is one of the most important information in case of a nearby(!) search it would be even better to obtain the distance information somehow. Perhaps it would be feasible to drop the support of distance-graphics and instead implement a new approach ? I once learned, that there is a very small HTML on geocaching.com used for send2gps. If I remember right, it is very small and gives coordinate information for the cache requested.

		The graphic files shown to basic members in nearby search results are in km/mi depending on the setting on geocaching.com. Some users complain that miles are shown although they selected metric units in c:geo. Reason is most likely, that imperial units are the default on geocaching.com unless the user changes this setting. For PM the setting on the website is not relevant as c:geo calculates automatically according to the setting. I suggest to implement that c:geo changes the preference on the website according to the user setting (as it is already done e.g. for the language setting) to avoid a mismatch.

		As discussed in #1308 (or in the related pull request) currently the app crashes if an invalid mapfile is selected. Unfortunately it also crashes if the offline map is activated while no file has been selected. This means, that every user with default settings (no map-file selected) will experience a crash if he e.g. accidentally selects OSM:Offline. Is it possible to disable this map selection as long as no file at all has been given in the settings to avoid this problem ?

		I will try to port cgeo to Bada because I have a friend with a Samsung Galaxy Wave II with this stupid OS Bada. No program I saw is as good as cgeo and the only good program for Bada crashes every some minutes. And because I have a Samsung Galaxy Mini, I will try to get all geocaches to the SD card. This is really the only think I hate at cgeo and now I'm waiting more than half a year and no one with the needed programming knowledge wants to solve the problem. Now I try to get the hang of Android and Bada programming. It may take more months than anybody here would need...

		Currently there is no possibility to manually download static maps for a certain cache in case the general setting &quot;Download static maps for caches&quot; is switched off in the settings. But switching it on in the settings will also load the static maps generally e.g. in case of GPX-imports. This has some side effects like long import time, google timing issue and restrictions. It should be possible to download static maps manually for a cache (like it is already implemented for the case that no static map is available). After this has been implemented I would further suggest to have the general setting for downloading static maps switched off in order to avoid problems on GPX-imports. My personal guess is, that only a minor percentage of users want to have a static map by default in this case. Another possibility would be to introduce a new setting for &quot;Static map download for GPX-imports&quot; to split up the usecases. This should be switched off by default.

		Refreshing a cache with original waypoints will create new waypoint ids for the original waypoints but leave old static map files for the waypoints. Old waypoint files should be deleted. This issue also takes place in refactoring issues. I would like to store coords information about static maps. This should prevent from download the same static maps again and could help removing old files on fresh.

		This morning my battery was at 100% and I haven't opened c:geo a single time. GPS has been disabled all day. After about 9 hours my battery is down to 56% and Android says that c:geo is responsible for 97% of that (battery usage screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/wMjhd.png, detailed battery graph: http://i.imgur.com/Nmb0c.png) The &quot;Use details&quot; for c:geo have Keep Awake at 1 second, which is clearly not right. You can see that my phone has not gone to sleep at all in this period. Phone is a T-Mobile G2 running CyanogenMod 7.2.0-RC0. It's the build that somebody made to fix the voicemail notification error, but I can test with a standard build or different ROM if necessary.

			<description>
		After implementation of the new popups for waypoints (which is a very nice thing) I have the following &quot;problem&quot;: On some multi caches the owners created an additional WP for the first stage. As (according to GC-guidelines) the coords of the multi are also the coords of the first stage you will have cache and first WP on same coords. The map shows the cache icon correctly but clicking on it will bring up the WP popup as well as the cache popup (i.e. if you close the WP popup in front you will see the cache popup). I suggest to suppress the WP-popup in case the parent cache is at the same coords. Example: GC1PHGH

		If I am not completely wrong my owned caches used to have a grey (instead black) background in the lists. This marking is gone after the latest design-changes to the lists. I am not suggesting to have it back (because it did not fit into the remaining frontend design anyway) but it is also not good to loose a &quot;feature&quot; Therefore I would like to suggest to use the owned icon (star) as overlay (like on the map) also in the list. That would match with the strategy to align icons between map and lists.

		Using the latest build with mapsforge 0.3 offline map. Steps: Display the offline map Zoom in until the scale is 60m (200ft) or less Change the map source to Mapnik OSM maps You will get blank map and no tiles will ever load. If you look at the log, you will eventually see TileDownloader: java.io.FileNotFoundException: http://tile.openstreetmap.org/19/465485/206885.png The problem is that c-geo is trying to download tiles at a higher zoom level than is available from the website. I believe this is caused by reusing the mapView and mapController when the map source is changed.

		I use c:geo for working with two geocaching accounts - one with friends and another with the kids. It is obviously simple to log in to either account as and when I need to, but I have noticed that the status of the caches, e.g. 'found', are not specific to either account. So caches that I have found with either account are shown as found when logged in to either account.

		I have a Dakota 20 now. Now I would like c:geo to export a cache list including original and own waypoints in the same format gc.com provides. That would improve my searches in the woods and below trees by far. The current GPX Export is only imported as waypoints, not as caches. Maybe someone has another solution?

		I use to get my PQs via mail and save the GPX-attachments from there (so they are stored in /mnt/sdcard/downloads on my device). After that I can easily import them to c:geo as it scans the sdcard and will find them. Just a few days ago I used the GPX-export for the first time. It will put the GPX into /mnt/sdcard/gpx which is perfect as it is. Unfortunately now the import will no longer scan the sdcard as it finds gpx-files in the default directory and stops searching. This is no bug as I could just copy my import-files there manually but users which are not used to the directory structure and just want to have an easy way of importing will not understand what has happened. So I suggest to add a button or something similar (on the result window) to force continuation of scanning when if it was stopped after scanning /mnt/sdcard/gpx. To avoid questions: The import of GPX-files directly from mail is still not working on my SGS2, but thats another thing which was already discussed.

		I just found that there is a really nice method for enums: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html#name() Wouldn't it make sense to use that instead of always creating an additional &quot;id&quot; field like we do now?

		I want to do some refactorings due to smelling code in cgCache / cgeoapplication. This was found due to static maps issue #1512: cgCache.addWaypoint(waypoint, true) -- does add/insert or change/update not only add -- name should be changed to addOrChangeWaypoint cgCache.addWaypoint calls cgeoapplication.saveOwnWaypoint(waypointid, geocode, waypoint) -- call is done for all waypoints not only own ones -- should be renamed to _saveWaypoint EditWaypointActivit needs to update the cgCache attribute &quot;finalDefined&quot; not storing the whole cache and delete / insert original waypoints I would like to: rename cgCache.addWaypoint(...) to cgCache.addOrChangeWaypoint(...). rename cgeoapplication.saveOwnWaypoint(...) to cgeoapplication.saveWaypoint(...) add the possibility to update only the main cache table skipping other things Can I go for it?

		EditWaypointActivity does a call to cgCache.save to store &quot;finalDefined&quot; attribute. Unfortunately the cache update flag is not set and so not &quot;detailed&quot; caches skip an update (e.g. GC3FR70). Otherwise detailed caches delete/insert original waypoints invalidating origin waypoint static maps filename ... After the refactoring of issue #1557 adding a possibility to store only cache main table data, this should be used in EditWaypointActivity to store the attribute after setting cache update flag to true. So finalDefined can always be stored and original waypoint static maps filenames will never be invalid.

		There is the same question on &quot;drop selected&quot; and &quot;drop all and remove list&quot;. The message is &quot;Do you want to remove selected caches from list?&quot;. This made me think I chose the correct item yesterday, removing a whole list. Furthermore the items appeared at the default list. It seems somehow strange to me, not sure if I can reproduce.

		Today I had the opportunity to test this new feature. Here is what I did: Logged 4 caches without data-connection (resulting in stored log only, orange marker) Enable data access again Go to lists Click Menu, Select Export/Field Notes, Check &quot;Upload to geocaching.com&quot;, Click &quot;Export&quot; The progress window shows 100% (38/38) immediately (Please note: It should only be 4 caches to be uploaded, 38 is the sum of caches on my list) After the progress disappears, a toast message is shown &quot;Saved field notes to .....&quot; Checking the website I see no changes. The log is only showing: 05-13 22:53:52.395 D/cgeo    (12649): GET http://www.geocaching.com/my/uploadfieldnotes.aspx

 It keeps reproducible. I am not able to upload the fieldnotes. I checked the field-notes file which is stored as well. It contains the 4 caches in question and looks normal AFAIR.

		As discussed in 23ba555 I added the labels &quot;Duplicate&quot; and &quot;NoChange&quot; which can be used to flag issue which to the time they are closed: Duplicate: Issue already covered by another issue (I could be useful to give a reference to the other issue as a comment). NoChange: The issue can not be solved as it is e.g. a system limitation or a problem outside c:geo application. The reason for creating this labels is, that this seems more useful as having e.g. a milestone &quot;No Change&quot;. Please use it once you close an issue with the reasons mentioned or provide a feedback here if you disagree with this proposal. If you think other label-colors are meaningful, feel free to change :-)

		Using latest build. Steps: I had imported some caches via GPX I went into the settings and set it to store static maps for caches and waypoints (I normally have it disabled) I connected via wifi (data on the phone was turned off, so wifi was only connection) I viewed one of the lists with OSM offline map (but with no offline map loaded, so it was just blank tiles) I clicked on each cache that was near me so the popup opened I then clicked Refresh in the popup so that static maps would be downloaded Once I was out caching (no more wifi), I scrolled down in the Details window and there were no static maps. I thought maybe I hadn't given it enough time to download before disconnecting the wifi (there is no indication of download start, progressing or completing) But, if I go Menu / Navigate / Static Maps, then the static maps are displayed This happend with all of the caches I refreshed via popup (which I think might be the problem). I think this could be reproduced more simply than all the steps I list above, but I don't have the wifi/data connection to test.

		The GPS arrows are repainted on every change, even if that is in the fractional degrees only. Therefore I changed that to only invalidate the view if a certain threshold in direction change is reached. Interestingly I still get lots of redraws on the compass views, which are somehow triggered from somewhere else. I'm currently wondering how that happens (somehow triggered by that one update, resort and notifyDataSetChanged per second maybe)... (but to tired now to find the solution)

		NB1605 I'm using offline maps. Yesterday I moved the map file from one folder to another. When I tried to open LiveMap (with offline maps) then I got the following error. (It can also be done by modifying the path in settings view.) E/AndroidRuntime(20855): FATAL EXCEPTION: MapWorker E/AndroidRuntime(20855): java.lang.NullPointerException E/AndroidRuntime(20855): at org.mapsforge.map.reader.MapDatabase.executeQuery(MapDatabase.java:247) E/AndroidRuntime(20855): at org.mapsforge.android.maps.mapgenerator.databaserenderer.DatabaseRenderer.executeJob(DatabaseRenderer.java:169) E/AndroidRuntime(20855): at org.mapsforge.android.maps.mapgenerator.MapWorker.doWork(MapWorker.java:73) E/AndroidRuntime(20855): at org.mapsforge.android.maps.PausableThread.run(PausableThread.java:90) W/ActivityManager( 1767): Force finishing activity cgeo.geocaching/.maps.mapsforge.MapsforgeMapActivity I/Process (20855): Sending signal.

		This one from support email: I just have one question. When I select navigate to geocache option, map is shown with a geocache marker and my current location (arrow). When I get close to the geocache, the arrow goes underneath the geocache marker. The geocache marker is big and it is totally obscuring the arrow. Is there a way to have the arrow go over the geocache marker? This would help me (and probably others) to navigate very close to the cache location before we start searching.

		I've got an Archos 5IT with Android 1.6 (software version 2.0.45) and cgeo version 27.04.2012. My problems: reload of a cache &gt; &quot;c:geo can't refresh the cache&quot; import via send to cgeo &gt; caches are download but appears nowhere no new version avalaible from the market like before... CGEO is frozen on my latest version. I can update my data. Is my Archos too old for the new versions of cgeo ? (It works welll on my Motorola Defy and my Samsung Galaxy Ace) Edit: SORRY , I just download the apk directly from cgeo.org and installed it. IT WORKS ! with version 09.05.2012 The problems is that the market don't ask me for new avalaible version.

		At the moment there are four overlays in the live map caches (online + stored + waypoints) other cachers (Go4Cache) position scale I'd like to add/splitt additional overlays resulting in overlays for online caches (limited to 500 (?) caches) stored caches (unlimited) waypoints (unlimited) challenges (see #1591) circles other cachers (Go4Cache) position scale The user could enable each overlay seperately the same way he chooses the kind of map.

To advert this feature i'd like to highlight the user, e.g. with underlining the name. Also i'd like to add a 4th option to contact the user by using the &quot;Send E-Mail to a User&quot; functionality on GC.com.

		There are a couple places in the code where the following is used to determine if an error has occurred search.getError() != null. The code assumes that if a non-null value is returned, then an error has occurred. The problem is that the error can be set to StatusCode.NO_ERROR which breaks the logic above. I only see one spot (in GCConnector.java) that actually sets it to NO_ERROR. Here are a couple of ways I see to fix this. Expand all checks to check != null and != NO_ERROR Remove all != null checks and only check != NO_ERROR (requires making sure NO_ERROR is always set) remove NO_ERROR and only use null checks Thoughts? (I realized this as there is a small bug dealing with being offline and viewing caches in history that have been dropped from a list)

		Yesterday I did a cache series with my niece and nephew. It was one of those without numbers in the name, and you had some other caches (not from that series) spread over the same area. If this happens, it is really hard to just navigate the series with c:geo. You cannot use the list and sort by name (which works fine if you have a series with consecutive numbers in the name) and you cannot use the map easily, because you don't see which is the next one and you see the other non-series caches also on the map, if you didn't explicitly remove them from your stored list). I really wished that there would be some possibility to give an explicit order to a group of caches and then to have them shown as directed graph on the map (or with numbers besides the icons), so that it is more easy to navigate the series as a whole. Did anyone have similar issues with cache series? Or any good ideas what to do about it? Or ideas what to implement to make this easier?

		I'm not sure about the actual common agreement about a debug setting/switch for c:geo. I'm pro a debug setting/switch for the personal builds. The code could be protected by if (Settings.isDebugBuild()) {...} To activate this setting it is required to add an extra line in a file like mapsapikey.xml. Such a file could be used for personalization tests, too. This is required for tests like SettingsTest.testSettings() BTW: what is the intention about the actual debug checkbox in the settings ?

		The compass seems to drain the battery faster than anything else in the app. Today I left the app running on compass with display switched off and an hour later my battery was nearly empty. It had not been completely full before. Looking at the power consumption graph on the device, I have never seen such a fast decrease of the battery power before.

		Mucek, please register the c:geo repository over on builHive: https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/. That way we get automatic builds for our commits and even for our pull requests (independent of our own Jenkins). I've also not yet used it, but it sounds like it brings some value. And it's free. Have a look at this pull request in another project to see how it automatically checks pull requests: jenkinsci/naginator-plugin#2

		I would like to report an issue using the compass on HTC Explorer (3.2 inch screen and resolution of 320x480 pixels). The distance from a WP is well accurate (getting smaller when I get closer), but the compass itself (graphic) isn't showing the direction/moving at all. The app is not able to rotate (90°) when we turn the phone in this screen (but working well in other menus) I imagine screen resolution could be part of the issue ?

		I’ve been using cgeo in the last year without any problem. However, in the last days I notice that nearby option in the main menu is no longer available (is marked with a red cross) when the gps is not fixed. However I could use the nearby option for a long time only with the approximate location provided for the 3G connection (inside my house for example without gps) . I’m a premium member and a have the same phone. I’ve been searching for this problem and I didn’t find any solution. Could anyone help me?

		When you made online log and you are on really bad connection c:geo is sometimes unable to send log. It's only notified as toast and it's almost the same text as found. I suggest when c:geo fails to send log a popup window should be displayed. Something like c:geo failed to post log because server is not responding. and options. Retry, save offline, go back to editing

		Example: 1.) I store a cache which I have not yet found (no green indicator bar at left border in &quot;Stored&quot; caches overview, no cache status indicated on &quot;Details&quot; page) 2.) I find it and log it as &quot;found&quot; on the geocaching.com site using my desktop computer (I do not use c:geo!) 3.) Then I update the stored caches in c:geo on my smartphone using Menu --&gt; &quot;Manage&quot; --&gt; &quot;Refresh all&quot; (or I select multiple ones and use Menu --&gt; &quot;Manage&quot; --&gt; &quot;Refresh selected ()&quot;) 4.) The cache which I have found is NOT being indicated as &quot;found&quot;, neither with a &quot;Status&quot; line on its &quot;Details&quot; page nor in the overview with a green bar at the left border This problem occurs only if I refresh multiple or all stored caches. If I refresh a single cache using the &quot;Refresh&quot; button on its &quot;Details&quot; page, it works properly, i. e. the status is being updated to &quot;Found&quot; and the green bar appears on its left border.

		We got support mails telling, that the &quot;Add to calendar&quot; option is not shown for some event caches. I can reproduce that with the NB and market-version. Some are working (GC3G86R) some not (GC3D6YH). Both events are in the future. What I can see additionally is, that the event-date is not shown in cache-details for the non-working case. That -I guess- will be the main problem.

		The long description is not loading on the caches. I had the option checked for &quot;auto load long description.&quot; I unchecked that box, and restarted the program. With that, it should give me a box that says &quot;load long description&quot; on the cache page, but that option is not there. This happened yesterday, and I restarted my phone. After the restart it worked properly. Today, the program again was not loading the cache description. I restarted my phone to see if it would again fix the problem. It did not. Total freaking bummer.

		The last version (24.05.2012) seems to contain an ugly bug. All caches loaded with this version show their size as &quot;Nicht gewählt&quot; (in german mode) or &quot;Not chosen&quot; (in english mode). Caches loaded with the former version show correct information about their sizes. After updating such a cache with the actual version the cache looses its size information too.

		Found with RC-version 2012.05.30-RC-dd31d83. Test with first RC-version will follow: We have the known limitation that owned caches are identified as multi caches by the PNG-parsing. This is no big deal, but it allows to track the following problem: Strategy: Speed dependent (in stationary environment -&gt; Nearby search used) User: PM After loading has finished the owned caches are well identified (by nearby search): Zooming out a reload takes place and the owned caches change their type to multi and owned marker is gone: I guess this is not limited to owned caches, but due to the limitation in parsing mentioned above it most likely to happen with owned caches. It seems information from nearby result is merged wrong with map parsing results.

		I use c:geo on my Huawei Mediapad and since I installed Android 4.0 the compass doesnt work anymore. With Android 3.2 it was all ok. The concrete version I use, is Android 4.0.3 and I have installed the actual c:geo app. I tried the compass with other apps like Google Maps or other geocaching apps and all works fine there, so I think its a problem with the actual c:geo app.

		The value returned by the sensor for the orientation falls into the [0, 360[ range. However, when the direction is adjusted for the phone orientation through Compatibility#getDirectionNow(), a value as large as 270 may be added. This might be the cause (or one of the causes) of the problems recently discovered with the compass.

		If the List &quot;All&quot; is opened while importing caches with send2c:geo the imported caches will not show up in any list except in the new &quot;All&quot; list. It is quite inconvenient to manually move these caches into the standard list if you have quite a large number of caches. Perhaps should be moved automatically into another list, if you download them while beeing in the &quot;All&quot; list. Keep up the good work! Best regards, Kratergecko

		On a quite low zoomlevel the map on geocaching.com will stop hiding owned/found caches although it is selected. As we adopt the same implementation (for PM) owned/found caches are suddenly shown (most probably as ??-caches only as the zoom is too low to parse the types). I am aware that this is a limitation from gc.com but we should somehow deal with it. One possibility would be to not use such low zoomlevels for our requests but do more requests with higher zoomlevel. The usability might be very low anyhow as in high-dense cache areas you will only see a lot of ??-caches on the map in this case.

Using c:geo for this would be very helpful any way faster than using the mobile browser to access the website. It could just be possible in the log activity if I am the owner of the opened cache. I did not see another issue matching to this. If you find one, please map it/close this.

		With the market release (as well as NBs) the functionality of the limit for waypoints showing on the live map is working almost good, but on some occasions it is not working. I can not clearly reproduce this but it is something like this scenario: Live map is running while driving around A saved cache with waypoints is coming in range The count of caches on live map is below my configured limit (in this case: 20) and the WPs are shown The live map keeps periodically loading Suddenly the WPs disappear although the count of caches is still below the limit Closing and reopening live map makes the WPs reappear in this case Set &quot;Unverified&quot; because the described steps are not always reproducible for me.

		With the GPX import and export we confuse the user id and the user name of the cache owner. EDIT: Just if someone wants to see the effect: Import a cache (from GPX) where the displayed user name is not the user id of the owner, like GC31DT7. It shows the user id then. Now update the cache online and it suddenly displays the display name as on the website.

		It would be useful if c:geo would support &quot;Ignore Listing&quot;. Some cachers use this features to hide out caches they are not able to do (e.g. T5) from search results. Currently the search already does not show caches which are on the ignore list, it should additionally be possible to add caches to the ignore list.

			<description>
		When user selects Show As List from the menu on Live Map, it shows a list created from lastSearchResult which doesn't necessarily match the caches shown on screen, just the last batch downloaded. I think this is leftover from the old live map where a single search populated the screen. The implementation should be more simliar to how the list for storing offline is gathered. I assign myself.

			<description>
		Due to the same logic that causes #1757, often Store Offline in the Live Map is disabled when it should not be. The cause is the check app.hasUnsavedCaches(lastSearchResult) used when checking to disable or not. lastSearchResult could be empty with the new live map, but caches still shown on screen. The check should be made against caches in the viewport. I should be able to tackle this one as well.

		To prepare for seeking abroad, I add stuff to a bookmark list on the gc.com web site. It would be good if I could import the caches from the list into c:geo. Import could have a checkmark &quot;full fetch&quot; that would make c:geo not only fetch the GC codes from the bookmarks and store them as saved caches, but would also fetch the full details (and perhaps even a map snippet).

		A user with a Galaxy Nexus reported and proofed with screenshot that the button &quot;Load detailed description&quot; (or however it is in english) is missing on the description tab of a cache. (Example: GC3GB5D) It must be something device specific, because it is working for me with the release build without problems. Just waiting for the confirmation that he is using the current release and that enabling &quot;Automatically load detailed description&quot; will &quot;solve&quot; his problem.

		Hi, I've code to upload coords to gc.com, but I don't know, what is the preferred way of working with coords in c:geo. There are two usable methods: never modifiing coordinates of cache, only creating waypoint and uploading to gc.com setting final waypoint as cache coords and uploading to gc.com Please, tell me how to do it and I'll implement it (I'have all needed code) and place a pull request with final version. Thanks for reaction.

		The existing help-app is not working with Android &gt;=3. (#525) As more and more devices will get/have this OS version, the amount of user complaints is rising. The current behavior (freeze after clicking button) is not acceptable. We should think about doing something to avoid this from the c:geo side. This could be: Just remove the link/buttons to the help app from c:geo Take over the code (as it is reported to be opensource in #525) and transform into an add-on to replace the existing links Replace the link/button by a link to our own online help (to be created) On short term we could only contact the author to at least mark the app as incompatible with Android &gt;=3 so the users can not install a non-working app (In this case users will be linked to the online version).

		Sometimes it could be very convenient, when caches could be displayed on hiking maps (here in czech and slovakia we have realy precies maps provided by army ... today sold by shocart company). Theese maps are easy to obtain by mobile atlas creator (and there are many sources of raster maps available all over the world). Is it possible to implement using new offline map type ? I'had searched for android project that could display this type of maps ... and they are mostly closed-source freeware, but format of maps is documented.

		Last days it happend to me quite often that pictures in cache description are replaced by the placeholder (Pic-icon with red x on lower right) with the current market release (NB not tested yet). Reproducible with these caches, website shows it. Example: GC2XD3P

		There have been additions to the code which use self made dialogs just for very small input (using a text view or checkboxes and so on). Those dialogs don't fit the remaining visual appearance and are not the recommended way of implementing this in Android. Instead we should use an alert builder with a custom view: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlertDialog.html#setView(android.view.View, int, int, int, int) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9763643/how-to-add-a-check-box-to-an-alert-dialog

		The logbook page on geocaching.com has a tab for logbook, my logs and friend logs. In case I e.g. want to help someone finding a cache it would be good to have instant access to my own log for this cache. Its not worth an own tab but maybe you coud append it to the friend-log tab.

		From support mail. I have not enough understanding of GPX to decide whether they are justified: Thanks for GPX exporting functionality. Here are some ideas for further development in that area: possibility to configure the folder where the GPX files are exported Include following data to GPX file: Link to cache webpage Cache terrain/difficulty ratings Cache size Cache hint

		I suggest to include an ohloh widget on the cgeo home page. I always find that a good way of attracting potential new contributors to a project, if I see it on a web page of another project. It also allows outside people to &quot;judge&quot; the project a little bit (e.g. we currently list 49 contributors which is huge!) I suggest to use the last one on this page: https://www.ohloh.net/p/cgeo2/widgets Any comments?

		due to the apple patent infringement lawsuit against HTC New devices coming into the USA lost the ability to chose to open cache links in cgeo. now when you click a cache link it will open in browser this appears to be on androids with ics and sense 4.0 they want you to set a default with app associations in settings http://www.imgur.com/IqIEz.jpg http://www.imgur.com/p38os.jpg and unfortunately cgeo isn't a choice http://www.imgur.com/YOhuk.jpg the sense 4.0 automatically sets a default association with the stock browser and if you clear the default it will automatically default to the other available choice and in my case chrome , now I think if cgeo appeared as a browser it would then appear as a choice to open web URLs except the next issue I foresee it all web URLs trying to open with cgeo then getting an error or forceclose is there something that can be done to fix this from searching on the net its an app that strictly runs in the background called htclinkifydispatcher that is blocking the &quot;open link with&quot; popup that would appear prior to apple suing everyone Sent via Hubroid

		The field notes export has changed the &quot;Found it&quot; to &quot;found it&quot;. It appears that this was done sometime between 6/3 and 6/6. This is causing issues with trying to use the field notes with other applications like GSAK.

		Recently more cache information was added to the compass like D/T and cache size as well as the waypoint type, Maybe it would be possible to show the text for the waypoint (the note added to the waypoint) additionally. If you look e.g. at GC3FJ5F the wapoints note includes the question to answer. While caching you navigate to that waypoint and the compass shows &quot;Question to answer&quot; but to see the question I have to go back to the waypoint view to see it. It could be implemented in the line used for the type of waypoint (e.g. &quot;Question to answer:......) or even below the compass as an additional text line above the current coordinates. From my point of view it will be very helpful to know what to do, without the need to go back from compass to other views.

		I love c:geo and I used to love its map view, but I really start to hate it, because the map view crashes more and more often. I the past crashes used to happen for offline maps but now they do even for online maps (especially &quot;OSM: Mapnik&quot;). PLEASE try to solve this problem (even by using another library if the currently used one is too buggy).

		When planning the next vacation cache tour it would be great to customize the home coordinate. So if there is no GPS signal it would not default to the approximate WiFi location, but use the customized home coordinate instead. This also could solve some issues I had with having no location signal at all. (resulted in home coordinates 6000 km from my location [Germany]) It would be even better to have a favorite home coordinate list, but one customizable home coordinate should be pretty sufficient.

		In reference to Issue #1827 among others. I'm in favour of dropping the geocode as primary key. It would minimise the effects of broken geocodes. I don't like the way the Database is queried anyway. To populate a list for instance we do these three SELECTS. Retrieving the geocodes using the criteria SELECT COUNT using the criteria SELECT IN using the geocodes There are cases where memory is an issue, but not always.

		With nightly 20120627 I experienced that a running GPX-import is also cancelled if I touch the screen at any position (not only &quot;Cancel&quot; button). I think this i not desireabl, in my case I touched the screen to keep it alive.

		Today I installed an exif viewer from Google Play and tried to use it in combination with c:geo. The temp.jpg stored by c:geo is missing the EXIF information present in the original picture. Install e.g. &quot;EXIFViewer&quot; Open cache GC3P43W Open hint picture to have long press access to the picture of the cache description Long press on &quot;St2&quot; picture Select to open it in EXIF viewer The EXIF viewer does not show any EXIF data If you try the same from web page it shows the full information Can we so anything to enable this ?

		In issue #1833 a user wants to export a list of caches to import into another c:geo client. So far I only know that the backup file can be imported into another device. What about a feature to export a list of caches with our own format to transfer almost every data we have? This issue just to ask if we need this. So far we only export in a restricted GC.com GPX format. It fits the requirements on GPS devices but not for import into c:geo.

		Is it just us or have satellite maps disappeared as an option from live maps and other cgeo maps? Has this happened in one of the updates over the last week? We're pretty sure satellite view was there when we were caching at the weekend but no longer...... How do we set things up so live map has satellite as an option? It's one of the best features of the software. We are PM's so have satellite maps when using the groundspeak site (if that's relevant). Thanks in advance.......... The Sweeney Toddlers PS if this is a permanent change could you tell us how we can get old of the old versions of cgeo so we can reinstall please

		If I do a search using a place name, it brings up a list of the caches. If I then map that location I can see where they are. From that screen, if I choose Store for Offline, nothing happens. If I return to the list view and do it from there, no problem. Still a great app. Thanks.

		With version 2012.06.29-NB-fd3eda7 I found this (but it is probably present longer time): Don't hide found caches Open live map (Strategy: Fast) Click on a found cache loaded by live map (Type: ??, Marked found, Unreliable) Popup opens but does not report it as &quot;Found&quot; Close popup The map now displays the correct cache type but the found marker (smiley) is no longer shown The popup from live map on geocaching.com (where we retrieve the info for our popup) is not indicating whether the cache is found by the user. This means c:geo can not get new information on found-status and thus should not overwrite the found-info in case the popup is opened.

		Found in current master: Be sure &quot;Hide own/found &quot;is active Open live map and wait till loading is complete Only unfound caches are displayed Close live map Go to settings and deactivate &quot;Hide own/found&quot; Open live map again Still only unfound caches are displayed I think this is an issue of &quot;caching&quot; data, because if I move the map afterwards so that an update is triggered it works as designed. Only the initial data after opening the map is not updated as long as c:geo is running. So this is no major issue but just a glitch, however it is happening to me quite often if I am out caching and just want to quickly check which found caches are nearby.

		I assume there will be split opinions here but anyway we got the first support mails asking why they can not login using their facebook account. Can someone explain how this is working? Does it mean the user does not necessarily need a gc.com account or is this only a link between geocaching.com account and facebook account meaning the user needs a gc.com account in any case ? If it is only a link-feature I don't see any necessity to support it, but in other cases we should support it if possible.

		Hi, Here in Portugal we are a little limited on 3G traffic, and it dissapear if we download to much cache. It will be great if we could customize the strategy level by checking if we are on Wifi or in 3G. I could append with the images on description maybe. Greats PS: sorry about my poor english, please contact me if you have any doubt.

		From support email: It would be nice, if there were a counter somewhere, to show me how many caches I mark as found the offline-log function. When I am on a cache tour with 30 or more cache on one day, I am not able to count them all by myself. I can use the filter for showing all caches with a saved log, but there is still the number off all caches in the list showing. May you have an idea.

		With the latest update, c:geo now puts me just off Africa at 0 deg long, 0 deg lat when GPS is off. Previously, it picked up my location from my mobile signal and used that approximate location. If I turn the GPS on and then lose the GPS signal, c:geo will hold the location for about 10 mins or so before defaulting back to 0,0. My partner uses the same version of c:geo on the same model of phone but doesn't have this issue.

		From a list of caches, if you choose Menu and then List, you are given two choices: Create new list Change list Clicking Change list gives a listing of all the lists AND an option to create a new list. I propose that when List is clicked, it gives the same menu as when clicking on the name of the list at the top. The only downside I see is that it is an extra tap (and maybe some scrolling) is required to create a new list. But, it is one less click to change lists (for those that don't know about clicking the name)

		Is there a chance of updating only the status of a list of caches or making a sub-menu( or options menu) for updating caches in a list (already in archive) ? A funtion that only update the status (active, disabled, archived) for a list or selected caches? For example, having options for update caches, like: FULL (all cache update) This is what we have now [in my android it takes +-1min/cache] MEDIUM (Cache Status, Logs and possible GCvote/Favorite rattings ) LOW (Cache Status)

All 20 caches are within a 2km range so should be on there. It happens for google maps, but also OSM. As it happens the 3 caches are the only caches out of the 20 that used to be stored offline. I dropped them, but they still show up. I remember something about map only showing stored caches, but I couldn't find any info on that. Also read the faq, but I still think the expected the behaviour is to have all 20 caches shown? Is this correct, or am I missing something? Thanks and keep up the good work! I have a free GC account, and login is ok. Using newest 28/6 version.

		http://bcaching.com is greate website which can receive gpxs directly from GC.com via email. It imports them into your personal list of geocaches. You can download them into the android app &quot;GeoBeagle&quot;. However GeoBeagle is much less sophisticated compared to c:geo. So it would be cool to have c:geo connect to bcaching.com also to import those caches into your Offline Caches list. Also an easy way to keep the caches up to date, saving on requests to GC.com. EDIT: Here's info on the bcaching.com API.

		Since the introduction of this feature (give/remove favorite point to/from cache) there is no progress indication after the action has been started. On slow network connection the action can last for long time, so a progress spinner or similar should be shown to indicate to the user that the action is ongoing.

		c:geo should store trackable data offline along with the cache(s). When I'm geocaching, I often find TBs or something in the Geocache, and end up leaving it there because I don't know the trackable's goal; And I don't like moving trackables without knowi where they are supposed to be going. I think there should be a feature in c:geo where if you store cache(s) offline, the data for each of the trackables in the inventories of the cache(s) should be stored with it. Then if I ever find a trackable in a cache and forgot to check its info at home, I'll know where it's going so I can pick it up.

		One from support. I don't know this app and if it's possible It would be helpful if I could use the maps produced by Cyclestreets.net to tie in with c:geo. This is especially as they have made an offline UK Map Pack available as an Android app. Unfortunately, when I am using c:geo, the map pack doesn't appear under the list of available options. Can you advise how I can integrate the two?

		It seems the api from go4cache is down since a few days and also the website www.go4cache.com is no longer available. Some of the users (including me) really miss this feature. AFAIK the service was offered by a 3rd party (who?). If this is not only a temporary outage we should think about, what to do with the go4cache implementation: Is it possible and allowed to take it over to c:geo servers or else remove it from c:geo.

		When correcting the coords at gc.com and then using the send2c:geo everything works fine. But, when the already in c:geo stored cache gets corrected at gc.com and then again using send2c:geo the coords in c:geo are not being updated. You have to push update to do this. Is this a bug?

		From support mail: Currently the history only lists caches which where a log has been composed (online or offline). It would be a useful feature to also have a history of the most recent cache which have been viewed in c:geo. This could be done in a common list with the current history or (better) as a separate history list. Usecase: I look into some caches which I want to go for soon. Afterwards I want to navigate to those caches but have to look them up again manually and might have forgotten the name which makes it difficult. The user is not refering to the geocaching.com feature but a standalone c:geo feature.

		From support mail: On some caches the downloading stalls and takes ages or does not end at all. Example: GC1MAX1 I tested this and can confirm that the downloading stucks. What I can see in the decription is, that some embedded images are not displayed (only the placeholder icon) although they are already downloaded, i.e. if I click on the hint pictures the pictures are there but still not displayed within the description. If I open the same cache in a web-browser everything looks normal.

		Hello, The reason for this issue comes mainly from issue #1602. If you import/store/refresh a large number of caches, you'll hit the google maps api limit for static maps. Issue #1602 covers a fundamental change to handle this situation better. I am thinking of a quick improvement which could help a lot. If we sort the caches before starting the actual refresh/loaddetails thread, we can make sure that after a while all caches are refreshed (and have static maps). My first thought was to order them by the 'property' &quot;hasStaticMaps&quot;. So caches that don't have static maps, will be first in the list and get refreshed first. After that I thought maybe a more general solution would be to just order the caches by &quot;lastUpdated&quot; timestamp. So the ones that have the oldest stored data, get refreshed first. This would cover my use-case, but also kinda makes sense in a general way. Let me know what you think, I think making a patch would not be too difficult. Once I have the dev environment up and running that is.

		I want to ask you, if it is really needed to have this option for switching compass usage off. If you have a new installation Compass is standard and when a new user starts with cgeo, he has in the menu the option &quot;use GPS&quot;, what looks for him like enabling GPS, but the result on map/compass is much worse than with compass. So, mucek told me, the option is for some situations, when compass doesn't work, like in car. But when compass is enabled and it doesn't work it is the same like when it is disabled. So why it is not enabled all the time? So why you not: -) use compass all the time when available on device, without this option anymore, .. or -) rename it in &quot;use compass ON/OFF&quot;, .. or -) remove the arrow when using GPS only

		Hello, I was wondering whether we could use the OSM map files used by navfree. Usecase: I have Navfree app installed on my phone. It offers trun by turn navigation using offline maps. It uses OSM maps. So I have the benelux and france maps downloaded on my device (for my holiday). This is about 1.5G of map data. I also have c:geo installed, for I want to use also offline maps. For this I need OSM map files also, whichs means another 1.5G. Question: Could we re-use the OSM map files from navfree? It seems they use a different format, but possible this format is also supported by the mapsforge? The files/folders used in this format look like this (Benelux map): +---map_osm_6.1.0.152
    +---blx
        +---bel

 I found a page about OSM formats, but I'm not sure this is the place to look. While writing this issue, I stumbled upon the mapsforge ginary format page, which gives me the feeling mapsforge has developed its own format?

		One from support email: I live in Holland near the Belgium and German border. So I often go looking for geocaches her. But outside my own country I don't have an internet connection on my Android phone. So I use offline maps (open street maps). Every time I want select an other map (country) I have to go in c:geo back to the main menu and to preferences and scroll all the way down. Is it possible to make it quicker to change offline maps? Or is it even possible to show all the downloaded maps at once? So I don't have to choose a map anymore.

		Would it possible to implement a such feature based on GCBuddy app : http://www.btstsoft.nl/apps/gcbuddy/ ? I already had this idea a few months ago and did something on javascript. It works perfectly for me but it is not usable on a mobile device :( Here are the required steps (from my own point of view) : add 1 field &quot;formula&quot; in waypoint add a page for each cache to enter values (A,B,C) and a &quot;compute&quot; coordinates button. User enter values as soon as he gets a new value during the hike. Click &quot;generates&quot; button calculates new coord values for child waypoints with formula (if all required values are present). Technically, javax.script.ScriptEngineManager (or JEXL) could manage eval job. From my experience, user should input himself the formula because extract formula from text's cache is really hard. Used format is not always the same. (x or * for multiplication, ( or [ for input...)

		When I enable &quot;show circles&quot; and LiveMap has loaded a lot of caches, for example with 11/500 in the header, for every 500 caches a circle is generated and moving of LiveMap isn't possible anymore without lags. So, generate only the circles for caches within the visible area+radius.

		When I use the live map and click on a cache, you get the short overview from the cache. There you can directly use the navigation (I use the internal compass). When I click on the navigation, I get the compass view. Over the menu in the compass view you can switch from the compass view to the map view. If I use this order c:geo is crashing. Can somebody reproduce this issue? I have this issue only with the OSM. Live map select a cache direct navigation (not details and use the internal compass) switching from compass to map crash I use the HTC Desire HD with Android 2.3.5 regards PS: How can I set the bug label?

		At the moment c:geo already recognizes a coordinate in the personal cache note and treats it as a waypoint which is great. It would be nice though to have the map icon re-positioned to this location. (and change to the icon with a red flag overlay for example to indicate a re-positioned icon like it is done already in the listing of nearby caches which have a &quot;final location&quot; waypoint) The reasoning: I often write the final location of mysteries and multies in the personal field note. Then on the map you can easily see the &quot;actual&quot; cache location while planning your route on the road. also, when placing a cache it can help with checking the proximity of the actual cache locations.

		Premium member caches should be marked in livemap by overlay icon when user is basic user. It is annoying to see caches that can not be saved or opened. (And buying premium member account is not solution). I recomend: overlay icon OR ability to save that cache into cachecache for filtering in near future

		Hello, I would like to create multicaches with coordinates of the next step stored in NFC tags. On android, only Google Maps respond to NFC tags with geo URI (ie geo:37.786971,-122.399677) See : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_URI Does c-geo handle another type of geo coordinates URL/URI ? Or is possible to handle these one ? In this case, c-geo could set is destination to theses coordinates and display the compass or the map screen. Thank you

		I was fixing a cache out in the woods today, and choosing &quot;aktivera&quot; (enable) archived it without any prompting. This should go, as archiving can be done at home from a computer, disable should suffice. Even if I managed to accidently pick &quot;arkivera&quot; (archive) with my big opposable thumb, there should at least be a confirmation message where I have the chance to say nothx. Please, please fix. Cheers

		Hi there, we are the developers of SmartNavi. It is an app which can make you independent from GPS. With the help of internal sensors, SmartNavi recognizes steps and their direction. So you are not just independent from GPS, you can even save a lot of energy for your Smartphone. We would like to customize SmartNavi, so that c:geo users can benefit from it. We wrote an E-Mail to c:geo support, but they recommended to write our issue here. If you are interested, we would like to talk to you about how we should customize SmartNavi. For more information you can visit: http://www.smartnavi.2imba.de/ You can write us an E-Mail via: smartnavi@2imba.de Best Regards, Christian Team SmartNavi

		Last week send 2 c:geo worked fine for me. Today I tried to use it and, first, it said I was not registered. So, I went back to the send 2 page and re-registered. Now, when I click the send 2 button, it says it was successful, but nothing ever goes to my phone. I've tried logging off and back on to geocaching.com on my computer and c:geo on my phone. What else should I try to make it work again?

		Hi, today I had realised that it will be great when send2cgeo could be able to clean queue, by &quot;magic button&quot;. I have two testing phones. And I had sent about hundred of caches via send2cgeo to one of them some time ago (about 4 days). When clicking import from web on the other one phone ... it was downloading the same hundred of caches and after them new added caches. There should be a possibility to clean that queue, because it is really time consument and sometimes uneccessarry to download caches to all users phones. How this should be solved ? And how send2cgeo works ? What is the structure of queue storage ?

		Android (4.0 + ?) allows to store maps for offline usage. c:geo should be able to use them instead of always downloading the map data from google. Yes, I know about the osm offline maps, but their handling is a worse (e.g. the one map limit).

		In a recent commit the luve mode of the map was changed to remember the last setting or something similar. Now I see the following behaviour: Open live map (live is enabled) Close live map and go to lists open a cache and select navigate map Map opens with live mode disabled (which is ok for me) Go back to main screen and go to live map Live mode is now disabled This is a changed behaviou which might users think, that the live map is not working. I suggest to enable live by defaukt if the map is started from main screen. Sent via Hubroid

		Some time ago we removed &quot;Static maps&quot; from the selection for default navigation tools. AFAIR there have been some problems in case static maps have not yet been downloaded for the specific cache. A user on support mail told me, that it was a very useful shortcut for him and I can somehow agree to it. Does anyone remember the exact problem, why we removed it ?

		We currently have a label &quot;Website&quot; containing a mixture of issues. As far as I can see Send2cgeo code is hosted on github. In order to get a clear view of different issue categories I would suggest to generate a label like &quot;Send2cgeo&quot; for those issues dealing with code improvements for send2cgeo. I offer to take the logistic part (e.g. creating label, and labeling matching issues) if this is generally agreed by a majority.

		From support mail: Currently in lists and nearby result you can filter &quot;Status&quot; -&gt; &quot;Only PM&quot;. Would it be possible to implement the inverse function &quot;Only Non-PM&quot;, which could be quite useful for basic member to hide those from the result. I agree to that, on the other hand I know that the whole filter thing should be reworked. However I think this would be easy to do at the mentioned place as a workaround for now.

		Free from support mail: Currently I can only see my current coordinates when I activate some navigation tool. For a geocaching app it would be nice to see them also somewhere within the main app. On the mainscreen I can currently only see the town/country information. It would be a nice feature if users could tap on that to toggle between this and the coordinates. Example:

		An option I change quite often is 'Hide own and found caches' in 'further options'. Sometimes I want to show this cache to other cachers, or look for new logs and can't find the cache, because the option is set wrong. Next time I'm looking for unfound caches by e.g. adress and the option is set wrong again and shows me found caches, too. Would it be possible to display and change this option on main-screen (like the cache-type icon) or in the search-dialog? Or somewhere else to change it quicker?

		With current nightly I had the following problem today: A cache was stored on my device I updated the personal note on the website I updated the cache in c:geo afterwards Result: In &quot;Creating view&quot; c:geo freezes After timeout Android reports &quot;c:geo stopped&quot; and returns to the main menu Its not reproducible. My subjective impression is, that it has something to with the content of the personal note. Without personal note I did 10 consecutive updates without problem, after entering a personal note it appears sometimes. Here is what I found in the log following some lines below static map loading: 08-29 22:12:45.455 E/AndroidRuntime(29621): FATAL EXCEPTION: AsyncTask #4

		This feature used to work and it was useful to use &quot;refresh all&quot; on caches that were cached for a longer time and then just abort the process, when you've reached a point that all caches were reasonably fresh. Now, I don't know from which update (i'm using nightly builds) this method wasn't working properly anymore, but sort still works and refresh all still does, but caches stored for a longer time are not picked first. Also using refresh all on a large number of caches stops by it self somewhere in the process, it is not dependant on wifi sleep policy or screen sleep - I tried running it plugged in to usb and wifi and screen do not power off when plugged in.

		Currently log templates only include items about the time and user. Since logging is done in the context of a particular cache, can some items be referenced about the cache too? I am particularly interested in the cache-owner (getOwnerDisplayName()), who many name in their log entries. Unfortunately, I'm only just skilled enough in Java to be dangerous....

		I'd like to know your opinion on the best way for the user to get updates in a region. From time to time, I try to get new caches in a specific area but using live map, I have to deal with already found caches, disabled and not-up-to-date caches on the map. Either I should load all caches on the screen and clear after, either I manually check status one by one. Is there already a way to get : new caches in a specific area excluding already found refresh caches not up-to-date (saved a long time ago) Thanks for your feedback.

		Hi, for me the following occurs: When i start the live map and select a cache from it, it opens the pop-up information for that cache. When long-clicking the Navigation icon to start the navigation, it just jumps back to the live map. I'm using the latest version from the Play Store on a LG 4X HD.

		Hi, I'm not sure if this is desired behaviour, but it feels strange to me that everytime I visit the homescreeen of cgeo, the app tries to Login. This is maybe a good feature when a network connection is present, however when out caching my network status doesn't change. Maybe it is just me, but I feel that this is a not needed power consumption. I'd prefer an 'Offline Mode' where no login-checks are performed.

		While writing a log the insert function lists all possible templates in alpabetical order (AFAIR). Now that a new owner template has been introduced the &quot;signature&quot; template is even more at the end of the list and even on my SGS2 does not fit on the screen (I need to scroll first). Assuming that inserting a signature is a more common usecase than inserting other templates I suggest to move it to the top of that list or even better to have a third submenu (beside Add and Rating) to quickly insert the predefined signature.

Now when debugging my proposed pull request it sucessfully upgrades, but when I want to get back to master c:geo or any older version ... it is not possible, because of not implemented database downgrade, I need to uninstall app and after it install the older version and ... set login to geocaching and all other settings.

		The trackable handling could be optimized: Trackables once opened could be stores or cached (like geocache data is already). Currently a new request with loading time is done each time I click on a certain TB. Trackable data of trackables logged into a cache could be saved along while saving the cache for offline use Both options would improve the network requests needed and the offline functionality (#71).

I have no clue which reason causes the malfunction. Can you please have a look at that? Good example is this one: http://coord.info/GC1HR5J best regards Frank

		Hi, today I was thinking about enhacement to nearest caches search in c:geo ... from my point of view it is not so useful for user to open this activity and just see progress spinning ... when he can see nearest offline caches during download of online caches. What is your opinion?

		Hi, when creating waypoint or setting location for search .... it will be great that there is button (such as there are &quot;Cache coordinates&quot;, &quot;My location&quot;) &quot;Select from map&quot;, which will open map in activity and you just center map to selected location and press menu - select.

		Over the last months I got quite a lot of questions dealing with: Where to download the APK outside of the PlayStore Where to find the nightly builds On the starting page of www.cgeo.org you will only find them after scrolling all the way down at the bottom left. Maybe we could link it from above as well (next to the PlayStore link) to avoid such questions.

		I've been using the c:geo app for a very long time and have never had any issues with it before today. I went geocaching today and was unable to because every time that I tried to locate a cache the GPS wouldn't activate itself. Regardless if I was looking at the map view or the compass view, the GPS would remain inactive. The GPS is enabled, so it has the ability to be active, but for whatever reason it just wouldn't stay on. As a result, my distance to the cache, or my position relative to the cache wouldn't update. I could only use satellite view to get any sort of bearing. I'm using an HTC Incredible running Cyanogenmod 7.2.

		When I plan to got a new city, I often preload caches ( especially when roaming fees would apply ). All those go to the standard list from where I then need to copy them to a list specific list. It would be nice if c:geo could allow to directly show the existing target list selector when (bulk) saving for offline.

		On the &quot;caches nearby&quot; view there is a menu item &quot;enable updates&quot;. When selecting it, the screen quickly blinks and the menu item stays as is. Selecting it a 2nd time, the title bar changes to &quot;live view&quot; and the menu item says &quot;disable updates&quot;. I think the menu title (and icon?) should change according to state or even have two tries for the respective modes enable/disable live map update caches on screen Or of the current one button is kept update map enable live map disable live map

		I'm missing a search function for GPS coordinates. In most Mystery-Caches you only get final coords. But how can we find this position? There is a function to find caches by coordinates but this is not what I meen. It would by nice if you can integrate a feature were we can type the coords and the result is a position on the map. Thanks for this great APP. Mario

		Hi, I recently installed this app on my phone (Galaxy Blaze 4g) which was running ICS 4.0.4 and it is great, however the compass is really messed up. I can basically make the compass spin by tilting the phone back and forward. If I let it &quot;stabilize&quot; when the phone is on a flat surface (screen facing up or down), it is showing North, where East is. If I keep the phone in my hand in front of my face, North is pointing to about where South is. I updated to 4.1.2 yesterday and the issue remains. As a reference, GPS Status is also going crazy and the author confirmed that he's using a deprecated api because of android 2.2 which has problems with Android 4.0+ Smart Compass (part of Smart Tools) on the other hand, works like a charm when compared to a real compass. Of course, in GPS only mode, things work fine, but need some movement to detect the direction so it makes it more tricky once I get close to a cache :). I'll be happy to provide more data, if you guys let me know what you need. Regards, Georgi

		window.open feels pretty outdated. There are several issues: need to manually acknowledge the window experience with single window mode sucks: tab may be loaded in background “never allow popups” either prevents the page from opening or moves away from the current page Using the jQuery which is loaded by gc.com anyway, it’s possible to spice this up a bit. I have modified the user script locally, but only tested in in Greasemonkey/Firefox. Will also try for the other browsers later and then issue a pull request to get some feedback. The modified version loads the page in an iframe and fades it in once the send2cgeo page has loaded. It is currently displayed at the top center. I also modified the link on the map view so that middle clicking (“open in new tab“) is possible while a normal click uses the new fade-in-iframe-method. There isn’t any feedback yet if the cgeo website is down because the iframe is only faded in once loaded. I’ll see if it’s possible to fade it in on click and display a loading message meanwhile.

		If you are not registered for c:geo, the website will print out something like &quot;http://send2.cgeo.org Register first!&quot;, where &quot;Register first&quot; points to the exact same website again (including the parameter for the cache). This gives an endless loop experience for the user. The parameters need to be removed from the link.

		Since some weeks I have a strange problem with the nightly builds: On my SGS2 it is supported to replace the default font by a custom user font. I did this a long time ago and installed a quite thin font to save space on the display. All apps including c:geo used to use this font without problems. Since some weeks I do only see the device default font instead of the custom font throughout c:geo. Only on the first start of c:geo after a device restart the custom font is used. Any idea or might this be a system bug (as I also did a upgrade from 4.0.3 to 4.0.4). But in fact c:geo is the only app which has this problem on my device.

		After implementation of #409 with PR #1741 it is now possible to create/edit the personal note. However synchronization is not yet supported but this should be implemented on short term if possible as the current behavior is not user-friendly. Currently: Notes from gc.com are shown and can be edited A new note can be created On updating the cache details a personal note created in the app is deleted (if empty on website) or overwritten by the personal note from gc.com Desired behaviour (to be discussed): If the personal note on gc.com is empty and local note is existing this note should be uploaded to gc.com. This could be done instantly when creating or (IMHO better) if the cache is updated If personal notes are existing locally and remote there needs to be an alignment in some way (e.g. take the longer one, ask the user, etc.)

		I played with the new image gallery tab in the recent nightly builds. While it is working normal and stable on my SGS2 (Android 4.0.4) it is really unstable on my tablet (TF700T with Android 4.1). On the tablet sometimes the app crashes while downloading the images. It is not clearly reproducible, but e.g.: Open cache GC12C15 Swipe to image tab Images are loaded OK on the first try (after starting the app) Go back to main menu Open cache details again Swipe to image tab The app crashes while on the progress of loading the pictures Unfortunately I still have to learn how to take a log on Jelly Bean...so no log available for now. Due to the experiences in the past I would assume it is an out of memory problem again. Can someone elese with a tablet (high res display) test this a little bit and try to take a log (or can someone link me a detailed description of how to take a log on Jelly Bean devices) ?

		It is perhaps related to #1039 but has a different angle IMHO (and I could not find a similar request). Just recently there was a question on geoclub if it is possible to set your 'current' or 'home' coordinates in c:geo. While the latter is discussed in #1039 I think the former would be a useful feature especially when without GPS (either no signal indoors or switched off). I f we allow to enter (or better select on the map) the current location, everything (like cache distances, nearby search, etc.) could be displayed in relation to that. Edit: corrected referenced issue (typo)

		I just had a NPE in CacheDetailsActivity, line 2083. I'm quite sure I've seen an issue (or stack trace) for that one before, but I can't find anymore. Anyhow, I think I now understand that NPE. The &quot;view&quot; field in the LoadDescriptionTask suddenly is null. To my mind, this happens if &quot;notifyDataSetChanged&quot; is called while some parallel task is running (like the loading of the long description). We do reset the views of all details views in the details view activity when a notifyDataSetChanged occurs, so this might also lead to problems with other parallel access to the views.

		Tested with four caches (not my own) and they all don't have a link to spoiler in the cache description. This seems to affect also stored caches with the newest nightly. I am quite sure, that these stored caches had the spoiler link and picture available but now it is gone (cache was not updated). So I guess it is rather not a problem with the recent site-update but a problem within c:geo which came in recently.

		Hi, writing this just as memo, I will try it on clean master when I will have time for it (writing from phone in tram now). (It is possible that it is caused by cache download service patch). There are some changes in map code which allows to click on cache overlay multiple times, so you end up with more popups over map. Pressing back-back-back.. solves it, but it is weird. It will be better if it will open popup without data, just progress and grey titles and load data in background. And when it will be ready it can show data and become responsive.

		As per the discussion on #2128, we could add a new bug-reporting function to c:geo that would let a user send a mail to the reporting address with an attachment made of the last log entries. To avoid needing any permission on any Android version, we could exploit the fact that all our logs go through cgeo.geocaching.utils.Log static methods and add a circular buffer storing the N last logs (such as the 500 last entries).

		I would assume it has to do with the recent changes but I could not yet start to analyze it. It seems, that if I refresh a stored cache the waypoints defined in the cache get added again on every refresh. Furthermore, if a waypoint is removed from the cache description, the related stored waypoint(s) are not deleted from the stored cache

		Using my tablet (Asus Transformer TF700T Infinity, Android 4.1.1) non of the OSM-maps (neither online nor offline) are working. If I select the map while on live map c:geo crashes. From that point on it keeps crashing anytime I want to access the map (live or from list). The only way back is to change the map back to Google in settings. Unfortunately I am unable to take a log at the moment (because of 4.1.1). Everything is working normal on my phone and on a TF101T tablet , so my first guess would be that the higher resolution of the TF700T (1900x1200) is causing this.

		Since the some days when importing GPX the progress windows for saving static maps does not show the progress correctly. The progress-bar stays unfilled and instead of percentage NaN is shown. Currently I am not sure if the map download is working at all...this has to be checked, therefore setting to &quot;Medium&quot; at the moment.

		Since I've updated my Google Nexus 7 tablet from 4.1.2 to the official Android 4.2 release this week c:geo crashes every time I switch from Google Online Map to OSM Offline/Online map. Let's be clearer: I can open a OSM map and I am able to zoom in or out for more or less detail but when I try to move the map to change the position the application is crashing every time. I tried both maps version 0.3.0 and 0.2.4. It was working fine with Android 4.1. Thanks a lot, Vikala2011

		From facebook: Hi, I just changed my network operator. Since, everytime I'm using the &quot;nearby&quot; menu, c:geo ends in error. No issue with wifi. I got a motorola defy. The error is in method replacecachelistfromsearch (line 275). Error nullpointerexception. Can it be something with my new network operator?? I didn't have this issue before. I guess the market release 2012-08-15 is used. Log will probably follow via mail

		Hi, as we discussed on IRC, there is not progress when saving new/editing wpt. For my implementation of #2158 this is implemented just for uploading wpt to webpage. This progress should be extended to be shown for saving to DB too. Function should be refactored, because it is hard to understand what it does.

		Today I played a bit with RC version and I found that caches with modified coordinates are moving around. Live map strategy detailed, OSM offline. Start c:geo wait for login. Start live map. Near my home I have a stored cache for offline with modified coordinates. When map finishes loading cache is moved from modified coordinates to original. Click on cache or moving map around re-moves it to modofied coordinates.

		As discussed on IRC: It happens to me regularly that my Samsung Galaxy S2 locks dead (phone reboot required) if I use the live map with offline map for a longer time while driving around. The problem with this issue is: I can't get a log easily because of the phone deadlock (will try if possible with qtadb) I am not sure if it is really c:geo causing it or might be another mobility problem on the phone I will try to track this problem, therefore I opened this issue as a reminder for myself.

		It's about two weeks I noticed worse accuracy and moving around the right coordinates. Although it indicates accuracy about five meters it shows coordinates up to fifteen meters far from the right ones and what's worse they moves although I don't move. Before it was absolutely exact. Trying Google maps I can see the point where I stand stays at one place without moving. It's almost impossible to find some cashes. I use Sony Ericsson Experia Mini with Android 4.0.4. It's not rooted. I didn't change anything even no relevant actualization was installed durig the critical time. I've tried to reinstall the application but nothing has changed.

		Depending on the system timezone, the ExportTest may fail. This is because the formatting of the SimpleDateFormat depends on the timezone used for &quot;interpretation&quot; of the millisecondsSince1970 value, as documented in the sample code of http://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html Now we can fix the test by adding static {
    fieldNoteDateFormat.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;UTC&quot;));
}
 and editing the expected output. But before doing that, I would like to know if someone knows how GC interprets the timezone of field note exports. Because if they use a timezone different to UTC, it might make more sense to use that one for the date format (but still leave the output format on Zulu time).

		When viewing caches near to the sea with offline maps, you don't see where land ends and sea begins. More general: you don't see where your map ends. I suggest to change the background color of maps to light blue or grey. compare these screenshots of the same destination: google maps: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/49879320/cgeoissue%20map%20bgcolor/20121122_194901.jpg offline map: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/49879320/cgeoissue%20map%20bgcolor/20121122_194920.jpg

		We do have all of our menus in the Java code. The recommended way of creating menus is using resources. Having resources for menus also makes it easier to use an actionbar afterwards (native or Actionbarsherlock) because we can add the attributes needed for action bar items directly into the menu declarations. See http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html If we try that in code, we get version dependent stuff in every menu creation. Also Actionbarsherlock recommends inflating from resources, should we decide to use Actionbarsherlock. Therefore I want to refactor all current options and context menus to menu resources. At places where we have dynamic menu items (like the map selection) I assume we may still need the old Java code.

		Currently all of our database methods need to be invoked at cgeoapplication instead, which simply redirects to an instance of cgData with the same method signature. I intend to remove all these methods from cgeoapplication and to directly invoke them at cgData instead. Reasoning: Every single member/field in cgData is static (besides the CacheCache, but we can make that one static, too). That means it is a pure utility class, not an object with some inner state. And that makes perfect sense, as we don't add any state to the underlying database, we only need a lot of methods to more easily access that underlying database. As all fields are static, we can also make all methods of cgData static (which Eclipse even recommends, if we just change 2 method signatures of the current implementation). As we don't have any state in cgData and as all methods can be static, there is absolutely no good reason to have some kind of &quot;entry point&quot; in cgeoapplication to &quot;shield&quot; all the database methods from being accessed from anywhere in the application. Now some of you might object that this destroys the nice design we currently have. It doesn't, really. Currently our database is only accessed from the application class. That's nice. But every method that wants something from the database has a direct dependency to the cgeoapplication class instead. By removing all the indirection methods in cgeoapplication, we change neither the dependency count between all of our classes the dependency kinds the cyclomatic complexity ... Or to re-phrase it a third time, if you are still not convinced: Why is it OK to have hundreds of dependencies from all classes to the cgeoapplication class, but it is not OK to instead have the same number of dependencies directly to the database class? Basically this change will remove some hundred lines of code without any functional impact, just the receivers of database related methods will change all over the place.

		From FB: 1.) List the files Alphabetically by file name - This would make it much quicker to sort through. I've got all 50 US states and some other countries in my list and this would be much nicer to sort through Alphabetically. 2.) List the most recently select map at the top of the OSM: Offline list to make it a quick selection. This would enable people like myself who switch between Sat. and Offline to do this quickly w/o scrolling all the way through the list to get to Texas where I do most of my caching. This could even be called 'OSM: Offline - Current' just so it had a permanent name.

		I have just installed the latest version on my Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.1 and when viewing my stored caches, the closest ones (which are all disabled) did not appear so (no line through them). If I went to read the content, the line does appear through the name in the description but not the title. When I then go back to the list, the line appears... I then tried this with the next three and all I have to do is look at the description and then go back and it then gets the line. It appears not to be picking up the flag that says it is disabled on the first reading. Still a great app. Thanks Steve

		From support mail: Hello support, Have one notice I would like share with you, to make c:geo better .. Yesterday I have updated the app as the c:geo recommended me in the menu ... But I have noticed that scrolling in list of saved caches is not so smooth as in previous version ... It visibly stutters ... Also in cache details it is stuttering too .. The movement is like you are closing/opening some rough zipper .... It is not freezing in a few places for a while during scrolling but just whole movement is rough ... line seems doubled ... It doesn't influence function of this great and powerful app of course, but this is cutting a small piece of user pleasure .. even if previous version works fine in this ... Anyway ... thanks for this app! Current version of c:geo: 2012.12.03 Phone: Samsung Galaxy Note Android: 4.0.4 Kernel: 3.0.15-1068447 I will ask him about the amount of caches stored and if maybe reinstallation solves the problem. Nevertheless I want to create this issue as there are also some posts on FB speaking about a long loading time when opening saved caches and accessing the list.

		After a first look into the code (thanks to @marco-jacob) c:geo should already handle searching waypoints and opening the cache details for: OC - opencaching.de Germany OZ - opencaching.cz Czech Republic OS - opencaching.no Norway / Sweden OK - opencaching.org.uk UK OP - opencaching.pl Poland OU - opencaching.us United States OB - opencaching.nl Netherlands I did only test some of them before so I gave it a test with current master version: OC = Not working (No results) I am not sure if this is really implemented OZ = Not working (c:geo failed to download the cache details) There seems to be some functionality behind which no longer works OS = Not working (No results) I am not sure if this is really implemented OK = Not working (c:geo failed to download the cache details) I am not sure if this is really implemented OP = Working OU = Working OB = Not working (No results) I am not sure if this is really implemented Can someone give some more background infos what c:geo should support and what not ?

			<description>
		In the last version (2012.12.03) of c:geo I have a problem with the visibility of caches on the live map. I activated the setting: &quot;Exclude own and found caches&quot;, but it only works, if I am in the &quot;live-mode&quot; (live map &gt; menu &gt; &quot;enable live&quot;). If I disable the &quot;live-mode&quot; (live map &gt; menu &gt; &quot;disable live&quot;) all caches are visible. On swapping the &quot;live-mode&quot; the view gets instantly updated with the correct/incorrect results. Anyone else experiencing this problems? Any questions I left open?

		The 'Settings' page is overly long and complicated. Scrolling down to toggle common options such as 'Exclude own/found caches' is a chore. During scrolling, I also often find that I have unintentionally turned on/off one of the settings I was trying to scroll past. Consider restructuring the flat list into a tree for easier accessibility. I envisage the user would, on opening the 'Settings' page, be given a short-list of the main sections. Clicking a section would take the user to a page containing just the options relevant to that section. Clicking 'back' would take the user back to the main section headings, and clicking 'back' a second time would take the user out of the settings page. I foresee that only a single level of nesting would be required; Deeper levels would be counter-productive. I feel that having a structure rather than a flat list would speed up access to settings when compared against the scrolling up and down that is currently needed. Discuss...

		Excluding own/found is a feature I use very regularly. However, to toggle this setting requires me to exit the live map, open the settings, scroll, change the setting, exit the settings, load up the live map, and then find my way back to where I was before I closed the map. And then, once I've looked at the position of the own/found cache I was interested in, I have to repeat all of the above to turn the setting back off. Am I missing something? This process gets a bit tedious! It would be great to be able to turn on/off my own caches and my found caches from the 'Map Modes' dialog inside the live map. It would be even greater if I had the ability to differentiate between showing own caches and showing found caches. I often want to see my own caches but not found caches, or to see my found caches but not my own caches.

		I experienced a problem a couple of weeks ago which I wanted to share. I'm not certain, but here it is anyway: My login name on the GC.com site has some capital letters. On my device, I had entered my login name all in lowercase. I had 'found' some caches through the device, and these then immediately displayed the smiley icon. I later 'found' a cache through the GC.com site. I wanted to pull down the 'finding' of the cache onto the device, to get the smiley icon on the live map. However, when I used the 'refresh' option on the cache, it still didn't show as found. I tried several times with no success. It seemed as though the login name was case-sensitive as after I changed the name to have the same capitalisation on the device as on GC.com, then on the next refresh it picked up that it was a 'find'. I'm surprised if this is due to case sensitivity. Perhaps it was due to some other setting I had also changed, but it seemed for me that capitalising my login name correctly was what fixed it.

		Some relevance to other discussions of filtering, but this goes further.. In the live map, I have lots (like 5000+) caches displayed from multiple lists - holiday locations, local caches, todo caches, specific cache series, etc etc etc.. The live map just displays them ALL. It would be really handy to be able to select/deselect lists for display in the live map. e.g. &quot;Show me the Brocklesby Hunt series list&quot; &quot;Show me my local caches list&quot; &quot;Show me just my To-Do favourites list&quot; &quot;Show me my lists for missing months for 2001 and 2002 for the Jasmer challenge&quot; From the live map, the user would hit the 'more' option, and an option to 'select lists'. A list of the user's available lists would be presented, with a checkbox against each. A global select all / select none checkbox would be available too. The user can select just those particular lists they are interested in viewing, and hit 'back'. Those caches not in the user's selected lists would be excluded from the map.

		c:geo is great for finding caches. But.. c:geo is not so great for placing new caches. We can check for proximity - Good, mostly. We can find out our current coordinates - Yes, but not so good. We can record and display our new placement - It's possible, but not good at all. Placing caches is something I find difficult in c:geo, and I revert to other apps and pencil/paper. Is this other side of caching something c:geo is aimed at? Should it be? It would be a lot of work to add features aimed at geocache placers, but it would give users more tie-in into this app by giving them less need to go elsewhere. Checking for proximity is catered for very well. This is something c:geo does nicely with the circles on the live map. Recording / averaging our current coordinate? That's a bit trickier. The best way I can find to get our current coordinate is to open up another cache somewhere else and try to add an extra waypoint to it. From there, I can see my current coordinate and ... jot it down on a piece of paper. OK, so I can add a waypoint onto that other cache to temporarily record my placement on the device, but that's such a faff. I have to remember roughly where it is to find it again, and which cache I stored it under (which might be miles away if I'm placing a cache in a virgin area), and then I have the maintenance fuss of deleting that waypoint and moving it somewhere more permanent - back to my pencil and sheet of paper. What would be a better way? A 'My Placements' area in c:geo dedicated to storing waypoints of potential hides. This area would effectively be a stored list of caches, but these would be a different class. These 'My Placements' caches would have no GC code, would have just a UID generated by the device, would have in their simplest form just an editable title and editable notes, and would appear on the live map, perhaps with a different icon to indicate they are one of your placements rather than a real cache. For placement of multi or puzzle caches, a single 'My Placements' cache could contain multiple waypoints. The live map would show proximity circles, just as with any other type of cache. Access to view the list of 'My Placements' could be through the 'stored' section, or through the main menu, but creation of a new 'My Placement' cache would be through the 'more' section of the live map. The user would select to create a new placement, and would be given their current coordinate and allowed to enter title and notes and perhaps select some attributes. The system would allow for coordinate averaging, storing multiple samples for a point over time.

		I would like to know how a new StaticMaps download service in background can fit into the Draft of CacheDownloadService. StaticMapsDownloadService needs to download 5 maps for each coordinate and has to decide wether coords changed or not. We have an issue to first download all maps of highest level. So we have a list for map download requests stored in db loading asynchronously in background. We also need a status page for this downloads and maybe the status &quot;Google maps download limit reached&quot;. So what do you think. Should we separate CacheDownloadService from StaticMapsDownloadService? It is somehow a subtask but also somehow different...

		As discussed on IRC: On the list of geocaches on gc.com the &quot;Need maintenance&quot; attribute was changed to a red wrench instead of a red cross. Maybe we should follow that change. Right now I see, that only the overview lists changed. In cache details on gc.com there is still the red cross.

		Since the gc.com update of 11.12.2012 caches which are owned AND found by a user are no longer shown as found. (e.g. caches you adopted after finding them). This caches have been identified as owned by c:geo and had a green marker in lists before. Now with version 2012.12.03 and the RC 2012.12.12 the green marker is no longer shown. Only identification as own seems to work normal (I am able to log &quot;Disable&quot;,etc.). HTML example available on request.

		HTC One X / Android 4.0.x Reading my gmail, I see a published cache notification. I click the link in the email - http://coord.info/GC4xxxx. What do you want to complete this action with - cgeo, chrome, etc - I choose cgeo cgeo spins for a while on 'Loading cache details' Error 'cgeo failed to download the cache. Unknown communication error' Same result if I try to load the cache using the GC code in the 'Search' tool. Live map with 'live' enabled also doesn't display the cache. Hmmm. I'm going to struggle to FTF this one if cgeo won't load it. I add a waypoint manually and hop in the car. I got it ten minutes after publication. Job done ;-) Now I'm trying again back at the office later on to see why I couldn't download it. This is on wi-fi with manual proxy settings. My proxy server logs show no connection attempts being made by my android. It's like cgeo isn't going through the proxy properly. Normal browser pages load fine in chrome or in other browsers on my android. My gmail loads fine over the wifi. But cgeo? Nope. I'm about 85% sure this used to work on the office wifi with the proxy, but I could be wrong. Either way, it ought to work fine through a proxy. I have full access to the company proxy server, so I know what is/isn't being blocked at the proxy level; I can see no evidence of cgeo even connecting to the proxy. Is cgeo using the wifi proxy settings properly?

		(Market version from 12/12/12) I had the global cache type filter set to show only &quot;Event Cache&quot;. I opened the live map, with the 'live' mode enabled. Lots of caches appeared with &quot;??&quot; markers, including many I know are traditionals. On opening one of them, the marker changed to the &quot;traditional&quot; marker with the smiley face and the floppy disk icon - it's one of the caches which is already in my &quot;stored&quot; list and already stored as &quot;found&quot;. As I understand it, the request to gc.com should have been asking for only event caches? More than just event caches were downloaded.

		Some time ago the &quot;Open in Browser&quot; function was changed to use &quot;http://www.geocaching.com//...&quot;. I understood this change but was it intended that also the &quot;Share&quot; function now uses this workaround-URL ? I think it should use the coord.info URL to allow e.g. forwarding via mail and the recipient to open it in c:geo (or another app) again.

		I am not sure how this was before the recent changes on gc.com. Can someone check whether we have been able to detect PM-caches from search results before ? I can see in c:geo that when doing a nearby search premium-member caches are not identified as such. That leads to the problem (reported on facebook) that the &quot;All Member Access&quot; filter is useless in this case. Comparing with the website search results I can see that there is a (new) icon which indicates PM-status. I don't know whether this was in form of text before... Sadly this icon is sometimes displaced by other icons for that cache (e.g. Has TB, Needs Maintenance).

		Sorry for the late report...testing time was to short after site update: Perform nearby search (BM-user) Nearby results only show the GC-code in second line, the remaining info is missing Looking at the website it should be possible to parse D/T and size as well and for PM this is working normal.

		GC26232 is parsed as &quot;unknown type&quot;. AFAIK all of these are archived. The filter is supporting them explicitly. So I think we should either leave it as it is or parse them as normal event caches (like it is done now for GS block party caches) and remove the filter item for &quot;Lost and Found&quot;.

		Looking at the many recent comments on website related issues, I feel it would make sense to make it possible for every c:geo team member to edit the website sources. I don't demand that everyone can publish them on the server, but just editing the files (and having them published regularly by mucek4) would be helpful as some issues related to the website are lying around for a long time already. As I don't exactly know what is used to generate the site, I can't really say if it makes sense to host the files directly as yet another repository under the c:geo github account.

		Right now, the user can modify final coordinates of non-multi non-mistery caches because c:geo and gc.com backend allow that. However, that is not reflected on gc.com interface and may be confusing for the user. c:geo should refuse those changes as well. Related to #2271.

		In df33031, I just fixed a NullPointerException that happened during migration of database from version 62 to version 63 as I loaded an old database and happened to see it because of an opened logcat. As we ignore those exceptions after logging them, the loop to clean up double undescore map files was interrupted prematurely but everything went normally and nobody notices. I therefore propose to make Log.e() a fatal error when the Debug settings is on. What do you think about it? We will catch much more errors this way, and also probably reduce some Log.e() into Log.w() if that does not deserve a crash.

		I've originally saved http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC3X5R8 more than a month ago in c:geo. Now I've just refreshed it. The embedded geochecker image in the description shown in c:geo still contains 0:11 checks, which is clearly from that month ago. To me it looks like we cache that image forever, but we shouldn't.

		Currently the functions of changing the cache coords locally and on website are completely independent. I think the scenario of only uploading them to the website but not setting them as cache coords locally does not make sense (i.e. after the next refresh the cache coords will be changed anyway). Vice versa makes sense of course. I therefore suggest that when the user selects 'modify coords on website' the 'set as cache coords' should be selected automatically.

The log type &quot;Placed&quot; and &quot;Write note&quot; have a grey marker. I suggest to keep the green marker for &quot;Discovered&quot; and &quot;Visited&quot; and use another green tone (maybe brighter green) for the types &quot;Placed&quot;, &quot;Retrieved&quot; and &quot;Grabbed&quot; as these logs indicate a &quot;real progress&quot;. Only &quot;Write note&quot; should stay with the grey marker.

		Before the upload of modified coords was implemented the automatically created WP &quot;Original coords&quot; had the type &quot;Reference point&quot;. Now it still has the correct icon (red circles) but the type is shown as empty in the WP-list. Is this done intentionally or only a glitch/bug ?

		Hello, I downloaded c:geo and some caches onto my SE X8. In the beginning everything worked fine. But now when I am trying to navigate to a new cache (or even the same caches than bevore) by clicking on the compass icon I always receive the error message above. I reinstalled c:geo an tried some other stuff but nothing helped so far. Does anybody know this problem? thank you for your help. greetings TheWizard

		Some mails are coming in saying that the user does not see any or only a few caches on the live map. In the logs I see something like: E/cgeo (19123): CacheCache.getInViewport: got cache with null coordinates: GC32QDD
E/cgeo (19123): CacheCache.getInViewport: got cache with null coordinates: GC34JPJ
 What reasone may lead to null coords ? Is this a login issue ? I remember slightly, that we discussed it sometime and also had an issue for this but I don't remember the solution. If this is a known issue and a way to resolve is known, I will add it to our FAQ.

		From support mail: GC.com allows naming a related webpage. Sometimes this is used to refer to important cache information or even necessary for solving a mystery. Example: GC3BCT0 Unfortunately the link to the related webpage is not visible in c:geo. It could be added in the hint section like the spoiler-image link.

		When caches are imported via GPX, they are not marked as being owned by current user. Initial discussion can be found in #2304. Options as presented by Bananeweizen: A) Move the call to setOwn() from GCParser, line 377 into the cgCache.setOwnerUserId method. Then &gt;the flag would automatically be set when the user id of the cache is set, independent of how the cache &gt;was created (GC parsing, GPX...). That's an improvement as the flag and the user id are then always in &gt;sync during parsing. B) Remove the own flag completely. Instead make cgCache.own a calculated property, for which the &gt;cache asks its connector. The flag and the user name are then always in sync, independent of &gt;changing the user name in the app. Option B sounds best to me.

		We had discussions about confirmation dialogs in several issues already. I want to suggest to not have confirmation dialogs at all, but to implement the &quot;Gmail style&quot; undo actions instead as described over here: http://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidListView/article.html#listview_undoaction I'm aware that an undo will not always be possible (but in those cases we might even just defer the real action until the undo notification has gone). Your thoughts?

		We had some memory leak due to having reference to whole page strings in the parser, which were fixed here: 061e1e0 To avoid similar issues in the future, we might want to have a wrapper around the Matcher class, which automatically creates a new String instance for every group() result and then replace all matchers in the code base by the wrapper.

		Hi all, I often use c:geo on bike ... and there are some specific problems related to limited precision of control when you ride ... so I created this issue to gather all recommendations and point of view for using cgeo on bike. My biggest concern: Map .. it is very hard to click on cache icon when you can not be precise - solution can be very easy, we can create some bike mode ... when enabled, there will be menu option &quot;select&quot; which should open popup of cache which is nearest to center. The second problem of map is, that it is sometimes difficult to turn on autocenter (this should be too as option in menu in bike mode) Map ZOOM ... it is very problematic to zoom without picking some cache or not moving map center when you ride ... if it will be possible, we can use volume buttons for zooming too. Please provide me your point of view and some other improvements that we can do.

		We do not support multi-user mode (tablets running Android 4.2+), because in multi-user mode each user gets their own directories (accessible through Context.getFilesDir() or Context.getExternalFilesDir()) while we build the paths using Environment.getDataDirectory() and Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(). The path we use corresponds to the primary user (for example /data/data/cgeo.geocaching), which is unaccessible by other users. The right path to use for some other user might look like data/user/10/cgeo.geocaching and will be obtained through the proper API calls. If this issue is a duplicate of an existing issue, please mark the other one as a duplicate and keep this one as a reference on the problem.

		Hi all, I have an idea, as it is now obsolete to have dashboard (according to current google's recomendations) and as I use app, I discovered, that I often only skip dashboard to list of caches or active map (I don't use other options very often). I have done small test ... I added intent filter for launcher to several activities ... and it seems to be usable at least for offline list (minor change needed .. default value of type value is null ... changed to OFFLINE)and google maps activity, other map activities crash when started directly, but this could be fixed. What is your opinion on this ? If we are not dependent on going though dashboard ... we can speedup app a lot and make it much more usable. For lists it will be possible to create direct shortcuts to particular lists (the same as you can obviously create shortcuts to particular folder on SD card).

		Waypoint on map is not reloaded after editing. Steps: View map with some cache waypoints showing Click on cache and then go to waypoints tab and edit one of them or just click on waypoint directly and edit it After clicking Save, return back to map Click on any of the waypoints from the same cache The log show NPE and the dialog is empty If you move the map (which triggers reloading caches from database), then problem is fixed. This is what it looks like. Add relevant log: D/cgeo(16425): cgData.loadWaypoint(715)

		Currently when opening an oc.de cache the cache details show the attributes (e.g. &quot;Parking nearby&quot;, Available 24/7&quot;,etc) only as english strings. I suggest to align this between the attribute descriptions/icons we already use for gc.com caches. A huge subset of attributes are equal, only a few attributes are OC-specific.

		Have only the standard list available Store a cache locally. Select it in the list and then go on &quot;Verwalten&quot; (manage?) and try to move it to a different list. This fails, as the context menu does not show the &quot;move to other list&quot; item. Go to main screen, then stored caches again. Select &quot;new list&quot; from the menu create a new list. Go to the standard list select the stored cache as above and select &quot;manage&quot; in the menu again. The context menu now shows the &quot;move to other list&quot; item. Pressing it, shows the list of lists and an entry to create a new list. c:geo should always show the &quot;move to other list&quot; item, as it contains an option to create a new list.

		It seems (after searching the strings) the referer to geocaching.com for OC-listings (on top of the description page) is hardcoded as it is not contained in the translatable strings.

		When constructing the Translate menu, the following comparison is done: !Locale.getDefault().equals(Locale.ENGLISH)) This could compare a language_country pair (such as en_US) with just language (en) making the comparison always fail.

		Today I was thinking about the &quot;This cache description contains table elements and may...&quot; label that we add to caches where we are not sure if we got it right. To work around this we could store the original webpage in the cache directory (where we also store log images) and then offer an additional page in the details activity view pager where the user can look at the original stored web page (offline, not accessing the URL at that time). Do you think that would be of value? I don't have a full list of pros and cons myself yet.

		I am not sure if this is a new bug (since the change of the ownership icon) we never supported it It was already in for a long time Procedure: Be sure to have non of your owned caches saved or cached Perform nearby search where one of the results is a cache owned by yourself Start logging view for your owned cache directly from result by long press on the cache Result: You will see that only the default log types but not the owner specific log type are shown Only if you open the cache details the owner logs are available (Deactivate, Archive,..) This probably means one of the following: The nearby search parsing does not return the ownership status since the change. We did never parse it from search results Its a bug elsewhere in the code that when accessing the log view from list the log types are not shown

		I first tok notice of this around December 2012 26th. CGEO could no longer load any caches. When a cache loaded, several messages appeared as usual: load cache details, load height, load etc. But then an android-message appeared: CGEO does no longer react. Sorry for this inconvenience. (translated from german, exact message maybe different). Update 2013.01.07 didn't fix this, and since Update 2013.01.10 it's even worse. CGEO now freezes completely, and so does my phone. Was this behaviour already reported? I already installed CGEO completely new, but it's all the same. Kind regards, Werner

		I can currently reproduce a database crash which leads to immediate deletion of the database. I'm not sure if this is specific for my device or a general bug. If you want to try, first create a backup of your database. Then open the VisitCacheActivity for a cache and tap one of your inventory items listed at the bottom. During loading the trackable details, c:geo stops and deletes the database for me: 01-11 17:47:39.720: E/DefaultDatabaseErrorHandler(7453): Corruption reported by sqlite on database: /data/data/cgeo.geocaching/databases/data 01-11 17:47:39.725: E/DefaultDatabaseErrorHandler(7453): deleting the database file: /data/data/cgeo.geocaching/databases/data 01-11 17:47:39.725: W/dalvikvm(7453): threadid=18: thread exiting with uncaught exception (group=0x40c631f8) 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): FATAL EXCEPTION: Thread-20530 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): java.lang.IllegalStateException: database /data/data/cgeo.geocaching/databases/data (conn# 0) already closed 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.verifyDbIsOpen(SQLiteDatabase.java:2222) 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.verifyLockOwner(SQLiteDatabase.java:2228) 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.endTransaction(SQLiteDatabase.java:721) 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): at cgeo.geocaching.cgData.saveTrackable(cgData.java:1307) 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): at cgeo.geocaching.connector.gc.GCParser.parseTrackable(GCParser.java:1421) 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): at cgeo.geocaching.connector.gc.GCParser.searchTrackable(GCParser.java:912) 01-11 17:47:39.735: E/AndroidRuntime(7453): at cgeo.geocaching.TrackableActivity$LoadTrackableThread.run(TrackableActivity.java:286)

		The last few days I am often experiencing that on startup of c:geo an empty notification box is shown for some seconds. After some seconds it either shows me, that a new nightly is available or just disappears (in case the newest nightly is installed). I am quite sure, that with older versions the box was never shown when empty but only visible together with a notification. Did something change in the code with respect to the notification ?

		When rotating the device while on any of the cache detail pages (Waypoint, Description, Logbook,...) the view jumps back to the details page but the footer still indicates the page which was active before rotating the device. So, two problems here: In the ideal case the view should not be reset when rotating but stay on the active page The footer should be aligned Example: Logbook was active in landscape and I rotated the device. Now the details-page is shown but it is still labeled &quot;Logbook&quot;.

		I'm trying to refresh some caches from the map. This is something that can be done already, but it is awkward to do. It could be simpler. I'm in the live map, but with live disabled (I rarely use the 'live' part of the live map). I'm about to set off round a 5 mile circular walk, picking up 20+ caches. I know I might not have much connectivity out in the field, and even if there's good 3G signal I'd rather save my pennies and not use it. I stored them on the device weeks or months ago, and I'd like to make sure I have the latest logs and see if any are disabled etc. So I want to refresh the caches that are in the bounding box of the screen. I don't want to refresh everything with a full gpx import - I just want the ones on the screen. Now, I can do this. To do it, I have to turn on the 'live' part of the live map, and then wait for it to download the details of all the caches, which ought to be unnecessary since they're already stored. Since they're already stored, it's hard to know whether it is done with downloading them again in the background or not. A couple of minutes later and it might allow me to choose the 'show as list' option. It occasionally won't, because it's stuck downloading something I don't need. If it does let me 'show as list', then I can ask it to 'store' them, after which it will move them into my 'Stored' list, taking them out of the lists that I had spent much time sorting them into. Alternatively, I can faff about setting up a very narrow pocket query to generate a gpx of just the ones I need to refresh. Similarly awkward. I shouldn't really have to turn on 'live' mode to be able to use the 'show as list' function. It ought to be always available to use, showing a list of what's on the screen. The 'live' mode is I'm sure useful if you've got an unlimited data tariff, but I expect many users prefer the gpx import approach. If 'live' is enabled then great, but if not then that's no reason to not allow me to list the caches on the screen. Show as list should show just what's on the screen, as a list - It shouldn't include 50 other 'found' caches in that list that were filtered out on the screen because of the 'exclude own and found' option. I'd like to be able to 'refresh' the caches in-place, not store them back into the default 'Stored' list, or at least be given the option to choose whether to leave them where I filed them or to drag them back to 'stored'.

		There are many multis, whrere you need to collect indicies from many wpts spread whole city ... and it is obvious, that it is not possible, that you can not get all info in one day. So I have an idea, that wpts could be marked by user that you have visited that place and gathered info. This mark should hide wpt from map and differentiate it in wpts list. Does it make sense for you?

		My language setting is German. When I add a waypoint (eg. station of a multicache) and enter coordinates in &quot;simple&quot; mode, then the current coords are shown using ',' as the comma, but when I enter a coordinate using ',' the fractional part is set to '000'. Example: When adding a waypoint, the coordinate entry (simple mode) shows: N 48° 12,345 Now I change it to N 48° 11,345 (note, that it only occurs when the ',' is re-entered) When I save, it shows N 48° 11,000

		A user reported on our support mail, that the log text on geocaching.com is limited to 4000 chars. Unfortunately it seems c:geo does not limit the log text to 400 chars. If a user in c:geo sends a log with &gt;4000 chars c:geo reports it as sucessfully logged but transmission to the website is not sucessful in this case, thus the cache is not logged. I did not try this but the report from the user sounds reasonable.

		This ia my scenario: have all the caches on my country (about 2000) loaded into cgeo in a named list, via gpx import. Next create another list and import into it all the caches in and around my home town, about 300. All the cahes in the second list already existed in the first list, but i wanted to have them separately for managemnt, usabiliy and responsiveness reasons. However, as soon as i imported the 300 in my home town list, the country list shows 300 less caches. This is something unexpected especially since before cgeo i did my geocaching with Pathaway, which has an excellent point database management system. Is this a bug or a feature? In my opinion it is a bug. Following an email discussion with Tomaž from c:geo support, he directed me to report it on the issue tracker. See below. If this is a limitation, that a cache can be stored in a single list only, kind of defeats the purpose of having different lists, that is a way to categorize caches and handle sets of caches differently. Sets which may contain some caches that are the same. Given the current implementation, the user has little control over the caches in the lists, because an import in another list that contains an existing cache will move that cache automatically from one list to the other. I do not think this is what any user would expect. (besides the fact that loading several larger lists will make the user completely lose track of which cache got where.) Considering these, I whish to submit this issue as a feature request to remedy a design flaw.

		Currently our search by address is invoking a search by keyword on GC.com (as this is basically what the website does itself also). I suggest to change this. We already resolve the address using the Google address resolver to present the user a list of potential matches. During this process we already get all the longitude and latitude information and could directly run a search by coordinate instead. This would also fix the issue that a search by address currently does not return any results from OC. Any comments or shall I just go ahead?

		Right now, we use an &quot;id&quot; to identify the waypoint, which is the row id in the database. Not only this will not survive a backup/restore which does not copy the database, but also it duplicates information: the prefix and lookup code are both unique for a given geocode. We should use a couple (geocode, prefix) (or (geocode, lookup)) to identify a waypoint uniquely.

		Hi all, I have one idea for making c:geo usage more friendly for users with slow connection(I hope that I'm not alone). Just to imagine how it should work ... we can have options how to save cache for offline (soft,all) where soft saving means downloading/parsing just a bit of data - coordinates, cache type, cache name (it is sufficient for displaying cache on map/in lists). When you open that cache it can automatically download the rest of data (or it can be downloaded by refreshing). This will dramatically speedup live-map and make geocaching easier, and there will be one advantage for gc.com servers ... it will save some bandwidth, because users which are now downloading all caches with all content can switch to this method. I'm not sure if this can work in current design of c:geo and how about UI of this function.

		Hi ... I have discovered with actual master codebase ... that when I mark cache as found (field note) it's icon is not updated with smile, i need to close map and open ... and it is ok. The same with opening/storing cache to download precise coordinates ... it will not help (map close/open needed). Isn't this caused by some wrong refactoring ?

		Live map doesn't populate all known caches. I have no filtering of caches set. I know the caches are there when I cross-reference online. When I search for a specific cache by name that is missing and then return to Live map, it appears. Other known missing caches still do not populate, however.

		Hi, I'm using self compiled version (now it is same as yesterdays master) and I have discovered one inconsistency (I don't know if it is regression or not, never noticed before). When you create field note (just by log offline -&gt; Found) from list, active map popup, cache details ... it works correctly, but when you try to submit that field note ... Log visit offline -&gt; log visit -&gt; (loggging window) -&gt; Send log button it depends where you start this sequence ... when it is started from cache detail activity it is ok ... it deletes associated field note (cache is not visible in list where you put filter status-&gt;offline log prepared) if it is started from list (long press) or map (cache popup) it sends log online, but never removes that associated field note additionally - field note is not clearable in that case by clicking on clear in offline logging menu

		When loading the standard list I get an OOM. I managed to get around this by lazy loading shortdescription and hint - like desciption already. But this will be just a delay from the next OOM again when I add more caches. Q: is this change of any interest? Or shall we just accept that there is always a limit by memory depending on the particular device and number of caches one uses? I know it's ridiculous to have so many caches stored in ONE list. But this is the case for me just now... I'm in New Zealand and there are many places without cell phone reception so I decided to generate PQs for the whole country. I'll have to tamper with the db directly to move them to different lists automatically. How to make multiple PQs automatically: https://github.com/koem/pqauto

 Trying again (with other caches on list) the problem was not reproducible. Possibly linked to #1350 or #1899. The FCs with &quot;Concurrent Modification Exception&quot; tended towards 0 in the last months.. so I guess the general problem of different sources changing the data is mainly solved but it seems this is a special case. I am sure that no background action was running (such as saving a cache, etc.).

		Verizon pushed Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) onto my HTC Thunderbolt last weekend and now c:geo crashes every time I launch it. FWIW, a few other apps on the phone were unstable after the OS update so I performed a &quot;hard reset&quot; procedure to wipe the phone's memory and return the phone to its &quot;factory default&quot; configuration. I then re-installed c:geo and other apps. c:geo still crashes immediately when it's launched.

		When having oc.de loading active this is a result of the nearby search: The setting &quot;Hide disabled caches&quot; was turned off to that time. Having &quot;Hide disabled caches&quot; activated I get the following output: I am quite sure, that this once worked after initial implementation. It seems the flags for &quot;archived&quot; and &quot;disabled&quot; got somehow mixed up or misinterpreted. In my opinion &quot;Archived&quot; should not be returned in any case, and &quot;Disabled&quot; should only be displayed if the mentioned setting is not active.

		I started over with OC. My found OC caches are shown on map without overlay for found and with settings hide found on. Is this information not found in nearby search? Maybe we then can merge this attribute with last db content for not stored caches. Then it would be correct if I once go to details page and this information is persisted.

		&quot;GC-Code&quot; has been replaced by &quot;Geocode in some parts already. However in cache details and on map popup still &quot;GC-Code&quot; is used, which is correct for GC.com caches but not the correct term for caches from other platforms. I suggest to either replace it by &quot;Geocode&quot; generalls or set the correct label depending on platform type.

		Currently a popup opens when you scroll to the image page in cache details. But what if you want to scroll to the trackable page? Then you must wait or press &quot;back&quot; first. I'd suggest to either hide the popup or load images only on request (maybe the user wants to use c:geo offline).

		@mucek4 needs to push a new bugfix release to market for the linked milestone. 3 bugs have been fixed by rsudev, lineflyer and myself this night, detected by our unit tests. Maybe there are additional changes on the site which where not detected by our tests. Therefore some more manual testing with the nightly is needed.

		I have an idea to reduce refresh of static maps for waypoints: I can add the hashcode of the coords and waypoint type to the filename. Only if the coords or type changes, the map has to be refreshed. This could be an easy change. Maybe cache map can be handled similar. Of course this has to take care of the waypoints shown on cache static maps. What do you think about?

		Sometimes when using the satellite view the cache marker is in the way and covers essential areas. Especially when zoomed in to the max. It would be great if you could be able to toggle the cache marker so it just becomes a tiny dot/crosshair.

		From support mail: I would like to plan my caching trips with c:geo. Currently the plugin does only allow adding event caches at the date of the event. It could be a cool extension to just allow adding a calendar entry for all caches types (asking the user about the date and time in that case).

		Today I was doing a multi-cache where I got coordinates in DDMMSS-style, e.g. with 23.4''. When entering them in our dialog, the fractional part as '4' it was interpreted as '004', which surprised me (and took a while to notice). Even if I think this interpretation would be well aligned with my expectations regarding fractional minutes (the three digits are so 'standard' to me that I simply do not see them as fraction). I'd rather not prepend trailing zeros for fractional seconds. What do you think?

		In case approximated coords have been loaded (orange circle) and later a implicit nearby search is performed (strategy Detailed and caches move to map center) the orange circle stays and the cache location is not updated. Once you invoke rhe popup for the cache and close it again, the cache jumps to the correct position and the orange marker is gone. NB 2013.02.22

		When using offline maps, if I switch maps, the zoom and center changes on the map. Sometimes it is impossible to recover without backing out and restarting the map. I use C:Geo version 2013.02.21 on a Samsung Galaxy S3. The maps I use are the massachusetts and new hampshire maps from 0.30 on mapsforge. If I am in the map inteface and switch the map from massachusetts to new hampshire, the display zooms in on Concord NH with a fairly high zoom. Likewise going from new hampshire to massachusetts, it zooms in on downtown Boston. From a caches Navigate&gt;&gt;Map menu, this makes it painful to recover. Depending on the distance, it is often easier to backout and re-enter Navigate&gt;&gt;Map. On the stored map view, this also appears to override the center map on current location feature. Thank you. Even with these hiccups, I really enjoy the ability to use offline maps.

		Hi, what if we ourselves provide downloads for maps for the users? As I understand, we have a server on our hands and I bet it is idling around most of the time. And mapsforge doesn't provide downloads for some countries yet. For example Thailand is not on their list. a) generate (missing) maps with osmosis on a regular basis and link to available downloads on mapsforge b) add links in settings to open cgeo-download pages (and mapsforge) c) in a later stage we could even integrate the download into c:geo Wouldn't it be cool if cgeo.org is the most complete download server for mapsforge maps in the world?

		From facebook and I also see this change of behavior in the nightlies: Create a new WP Tap on coordinate field to open the coordinate input dialog The dialog will appear centered on screen instead of on the top of the screen, thus (depending on the device) overlapping with the keyboard which is now opened Change coord format (e.g. from DDD MM.MMM to DDD MM SS.SSS) Now the input dialog is correctly reinitialized on top of the screen. This was previously also done at first start of this dialog.

		As mentioned in #1317 there is the functionality of send2gps on gc.com which returns reliable coords as well as some other details like cache description,etc. It is available for all members. Example: http://www.geocaching.com/seek/sendtogps.aspx?guid=881f33d9-9df9-4d2f-b229-35b621b044b9 I would like to ask you if there could be any good strategy to use this within c:geo. Especially I am thinking about the approximated coords on live map. As suggested in #1317 it could be used to retrieve precise coords in case the popup is called. Or we could even implement it fully into the live map... What do you think ? My opinion: Integrating it fully into the live map is a touch too far away from a browser behaviour but for the user initiated popup this is a real good option and would solve many user complaints.

		Found in NB 2013.02.27: Go to the list of saved caches Select an unfound cache and start logging Write a log and leave the logging page (not saving manually so autosave is applied) Returning to the cache details it shows &quot;Saved log&quot; Returning to the list the oranger marker line is not shown. It is only shown after leaving/reentering the list In case this procedure is done with explicitly saving the log the orange marker is OK, so this does only happen for the &quot;auto save&quot; procedure.

		From support mail: The app reproducibly crashes when opening GC46GDA. Reason is most probably the 38 images contained in the cache description. For me this is reproducible with the current release but working on current master. As I could not test on the same device I would prefer if someone else can additionally test whether this problem is exisiting in master.

		Following on the discussion #2533 and dependent on the decision about that. Some users will not understand why uploading with photo takes ages for them. So what about a progress indicator if technically possible (in %). Or we could have a warning toast message if the image exceeds a certain size, which states &quot;You attached a highres image. Uploading might take a long time depending on your mobile connection&quot;.

		This is not a big deal however I can not do this via github GUI easily. It will be no problem for someone with real skills. There have been comments on support mail, that users don't know how to display waypoint on maps. We have a setting &quot;Show waypoints on Live map&quot;. In fact that is not only valid for the live map but for any kind of map. This is useful but can not be recognized by the menu name. Could someone who has a free minute please remove the term &quot;Live&quot; from that string in all languages ?

		If I got it right the import functionality of personal notes from GC.com creates waypoints of type &quot;reference point&quot; for each detected coordinate string. Would be a nice feature when the import could identify coordinates tagged with keywords to create other types of waypoints during import from GC.com E.g. personal note: &quot;Parking area at PARKING=N 50° 40.666E 006° 58.222 My calculated final coordinates: FINAL=N 50° 40.777E 006° 58.111 Get some ice cream at N 50° 40.555E 006° 58.000&quot; Import creates one waypoint of type &quot;parking area&quot;, one of type &quot;final&quot; and one of the default type &quot;reference point&quot;

When user changes their GC username the open profile link fails with 404 error as it's not opening the users updated id.  It also stops showing your own caches as it doesn't match the user ids up.

Having clicked the send to device button on my browser and the Import from the Web button on my device, the devices c:geo home screen now shows 6 stored. But when clicking on the stored button on the device, nothing appears. Clicking between 'All caches' and 'Stored' (which shows a [6]) still doesn't resolve the problem. Whats going wrong?

		Feature Request: Right now it is possible to sort caches by the absolute number of fav-points received. To get an even better ranking of the best geocaches, sorting by a &quot;Wilson score confidence interval&quot; would be very useful. On http://project-gc.com (menu Cache stats) you can see a comparison of various methods.

		Save a cache nearby to you Add a custom waypoint with nearby coordinates to it Verify on live map you see the cache and the created waypoint (live map wp limit setting &gt;0 of course) Delete that cache from your lists Open live map and move and pan around a bit =&gt; Cache is gone but the WP suddenly appears again Possibly linked to #2558 ?

		Today I did some spontaneous caching with live map. Zooming out to 1km and driving loaded several aproximated (orange circled) caches. Zooming to 800m I wanted to get updated coords by opening popup and going back to map. The cache display didn't seem to change on live map. But I got a second cache overlay (without orange circle) below the first almost invisible. I bet, both caches are in the list. NB 2013-03-12

			<description>
		Caches on lists should be initially sorted by distance. After opening the lists or changing between lists I can see, that caches are not sorted by distance initially but seem random. Waiting for some seconds the order suddenly changes to the correct distance sorting. The appearance of this problem seems to be depending on the GPS status for me. If I only work on &quot;coarse location&quot;(i.e. no GPS fix, but position by WLAN/Network) the delay is as described. If GPS signal is fixed the list opens in random order as well but immediately gets resorted. The distances shown in the list are correct at any time, so there seems to be another glitch causing this.

		Idea of a user: Currently on the cache-detail screen the coordinate format can be changed by tapping onto the coordinates. On the waypoint tab however this is not working, but you have to edit the waypoint, use the dropdown selection to change the format and read it from the editor window. It would be a useful addon and an alignment of the user interface if this one click conversion would also work on the waypoint tab. Usecase: For car navigation the car does only accept DMS and you have to first edit the parking waypoint before you can use the coordinates in you car navigation each time.

		This was probably in since a long time but not relevant as logging was fast: While a log is being posted (including a picture it might take some time) I tend to tap on the screen to keep it alive. If I tap outside the upload progress window it disappears but the uploading process is still running (as after a while my log is visible on the website).

		I described something like this already in #2178 but right now I am quite sure what has happened. Today I had the following experience: Started c:geo, waited for Login OK Opened live map and went for a cache Logged the cache from live map popup and returned to live map Then I decided I need a warm up before going for the next cache, thus I &quot;closed&quot; c:geo with the home button on my device Approx 30-50 minutes later I &quot;restarted&quot; c:geo via the normal launcher icon on my home screen It came up immediately with the live map (where I left it) After I moved a bit a reload was triggered and suddenly all my found caches are showing up without found marker (I hide them by default). So it seems the login has expired but c:geo still loads data from the live map as &quot;anonymous&quot; user. We should be able to catch the fact, that the live map is not longer working in &quot;logged in&quot; mode before loading anything from it. Side effect of this: The caches loaded accidently remain in cachecache and thus bother the user until next &quot;cold start&quot; of c:geo.

		There is not enough network input sanitisation. I can look on this, but not now. The problem is, that sometimes you can be connected to wifi network which redirects all http traffic to some page, where you have to insert password. If you are connected to such wifi ... and try to log a cache ... cgeo crashes, instead refusing to log online. (I have suspection that it is something related to trackables, because it works for short period of time (you can type one word or so)).

		Hi all, today I had some problems with integrity of my SD card. It is not connected to c:geo, but it pointed me to this ... there is .cgeo directory (used as cache, storage of cgeo sqlite backup and ...) ... there were about 3000 directories, but I have only 900 caches stored. How this is maintained ? I feel that it is &quot;write-only&quot;, saved when needed, but never deleted.

		Hi, my problem is: I have a list in C:Geo with caches I want to find in the next weeks. These caches have been moved by myself from the &quot;standard&quot; list towards the &quot;todo&quot; list. If I import the weekly pocket query with caches from my area, the caches from the list &quot;todo&quot; are also moved back towards the &quot;standard&quot; list. Is there any chance to keep the &quot;todo&quot; list AND import the current pocket query?

		From facebook: User Hi c:geo, [...] something else: The last 3 days I also noted a strange behaviour: refreshing a single off-line cache led to a never ending process (waited for 10 minutes). After cancelling the refresh and reopening the cache it appeared that the cache was already refreshed. first i thought thus was the connection, but it happened at least 3 times today and some more times yesterday. May be it is related to the new version? Thanks. Response by c:geo: Any example GC-code ? Did you select to save log images for offline use in the settings ? (Depending on the amount and size of those log pics this might take a while). What state was shown in the progress (e.g. &quot;Reading logs&quot;, &quot;Render view&quot;) ? User: i am using save images, like before. With the wifi it is working now, but it seems to take much more time than before. 'weergave genereren' (generating display) takes the time the other part is fast. One example is GC2CN97, another is GC2EBD5 (has only 4 photo's). I am not at home, but the wifi seems pretty fast itself as we watched television on my laptop (not at the same time ;-)). Downloading multiple caches for offline storage is also slow. I can check next week at home to see the difference.. another test: GC1YDMB, more than 5 minutes. I used speedtest and the download avarage is here 2250 kbps. could be my connection? And some more tests: my girlfriend has the same device gti 9070. She still has the old version so i synchronized settings regarding c:geo and refreshed some caches at the same time. The old version was always 2 to 3 times faster. also downloading 3 new caches is at least three times faster in the old version. Please let me know if you need more info. In my opinion the reasons could be one or both of the following: The new version is somehow slower, but this does not match my testing experience It is a slow connection in combination with &quot;Save log images&quot; activated. This is valid at least for GC1YDMB as it has a lot of photos. Any other opinions ?

		Today I was completely confused by our user interface. When I edited coordinates in the wild and afterwards tried to save them, I thought the application was hanging. In reality what happened was that the editing dialog was consuming 2/3 of my screen, with the waypoint activity still visible in the background. But the foreground and background are really hard to distinguish, which is why I tried to scroll down (below the radio buttons of the background waypoint activity) to see the save button of the dialog. (will attach screenshot) That's why I suggest to convert the coordinates dialog into an activity instead.

		With the current RC-version I hav a strange problem today: Perform nearby search 20 results are returned Open several caches from this result (and also store some of them) After return to the cache result the next 20 results see to be loaded each time So after some browsing in the results I finally wondered that the result has grown to 140 caches without selecting to load more results It is not clearly reproducible for me, but has something to do with leaving and reentering the result list. Is this related to #2607 and therefore possibly alreaddy fixed ?

		According to this tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNF8pXr6whU I've create a thumbnail animation for our main screen. See the video above to get an idea of the visible effect. I'd like to add that to our next version (to the main activity only). The performance of opening another activity seems to be the same as before to me. The visual difference is that the new activity does not popup from the center of the main screen, but from the icon that was touched. And that the icon resizes (and fades out) to the new activity, all of that very fast (and remember, we use black/white backgrounds, so it is much less obvious than in the video with the colored backgrounds). If you don't look closely, you might not even actively notice the difference. It is more a subtle hint from where you opened the new activity, so it might support learning the UI.

		I am refering to issue cgeo#2306, because I am experiencing the same problem. This was already answered by SammysHP, however I don't understand the explanation. So when you rely on GC's function, what does this mean exactly? It would be good for the whole community to have a good documentation. best regards Frank

		Reproducible for me only on Android 2.x: I checked the light scheme throughout the app with 2013.03.31-RC2 on a Sasmsung Galaxy Ace GT-I8160 (Android 2.3.6). With my Galaxy S2 (Android 4.1.2) the scheme is correct. When viewing the pictures of a single log entry (not the picture tab of the cache details - this is working fine), the background is still black only the picture caption is shown black on white. As the menu is still usable I set this issue to prriotiy &quot;low&quot;.

		I know a user of c:geo who has visited GC40 and shot a screenshot. She was confused, as the north coordinate showed N 49° 60,000 instead of N 50 00,000. See screenshot. She showed me other screenshots where the east coordinate was wrong the same way. I assume the true coordinate before calculation for display was a very little bit less than N 50 00,000.

			<description>
		I tried the photo upload function when logging a found cache with yesterday's nightly build and I am really really excited. But is it possible to upload a resized (smaller) version of the photo? Maybe it is already done, maybe it is done by Geocaching.com (my guess), as the photo there is &quot;only&quot; 2048 pixel width and has a little bit less than a megabyte. Here it is 3264 pixels width and about 3.5 megabytes. It took me very very long (2-3 minutes) to log the cache, and I had perfect UMTS reception. Cannot think how this would be with just GPRS/EDGE. Anyway, I think almost a megabyte size and 2048 pixel width is too much in my eyes and also kills data volume on limited mobile data plans, so an option in c:geo to shrink the photo to a selection of specific image and/or file sizes before uploading it can make sense for many people.

		When taken a photo for the log it is saved on the primary SD card in the Pictures/cgeo directory, at least for my device (Samsung Galaxy Note). An option in c:geo would be nice to choose the directory. Either the default directory where photos go taken with the &quot;normal&quot; Android photo app or an alternate directory.

		In the recent release [2013.04.03] the live map shows custom waypoints of own caches, although I disabled the option to show them. The cache waypoint itself [mystery location, the start of a multi] is still hidden. Is it a bug or a feature. I like to take the custom waypoints with me, especially if I do maintenance for a cache. For now I used the new feature to set the state of this waypoints to visited. This is nice, but they are still visible.

		When refreshing all of my 1000 stored caches I regularly get 1 or 2 out of memory errors. (in version [2013.04.03], but also in previous versions) However its not about a single cache, because I always manage to refresh all of them. (after several retries) Could be some kind of memory leak. More informations: Android: 2.2.1 Phone: Samsung Galaxy 9000 Exception: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError Location: CharArrayBuffer.expand (CharArrayBuffer.java:63) CharArrayBuffer.append (CharArrayBuffer.java:93) ActivityCompatHoneycomb.toString(RequiredFields.java:225) getResponseDataNoError (Network.java:417) ...

		Hi, Just for discussion topic ... I have one idea ... which can make our life easier. What about little redesign to CacheCache. Now when you modify anything in Geocache object, waypoint ... etc, you have to call cache.saveToDatabase(...), otherwise your changes will not persist. I have one idea ... to have CacheCache as singleton in our app and modifying models in that way, that it automatically track changes and set &quot;commit interval&quot; like it is being on filesystems. For example: you query cache by GC code from database =&gt; it is not in cache, so it will be loaded from db and sets it's validity to current timestamp and modified flag to false you modify it by calling some setter on it or on its childs (for example you add waypoint) model itself sets modified flag to true changes will be written back to db, by background thread, which will go through cache and write all changed objects and reset their modified/validity state on destruction of CacheCache (or the whole app), the same procedure applies (It's just and idea ... and to make it useful, it is needed to think more about it). But the main advantage will be in separating other code and caching handling. It can be good to look simultaneously on content providers and just think about creating content provider backed by CacheCache, which will provide all data to our (but not necessary only our) app, in future it can lead to creation of third party plugins.

		Hi, I had discovered one funny bug caused by localisation of distance unit names. When it is localised, it is not possible to project waypoints (distance). So .. should i remove that localised names ... or modify code, that it will be controlled by selector position, not by strings ?

		Today I talked to a friend who tried 2 times uploading a log (including an image) and got an error message both times. Afterwards, his log entry was there 2 times in the cache log, but without images. So probably we show an error &quot;Log upload failed&quot;, although in reality only the image upload of the log failed.

		Due to the upcoming release of OKAPI on opencaching.de I would like to replace the current oc11xml-based access to opencaching.de by access via OKAPI extend the okapi client to support all c:geo operations that can be supported by the OKAPI (logging, watchlist handling, ... possibly extend c:geo to support all operations possible from OKAPI (here I have espacially the more flexible filter/search options in mind) Of course this is can only be a staged process, but for the first steps I'd like some feedback When the okapi-client allows searches and live-map, we need enabled/disabled and user-account information for all OKAPI-sites (currently pl, co.uk, us, soon de, es, it). If we put this into the settings that would make a bed thing worse... To be a good solution for oc-only users we need to be able to switch off live/search for gc.com I am unsure if it is a good idea to store the Api-keys for OKAPI in the source, or if we should get some for c:geo specifically (with c:geo eMail) and store them in some private config, like the google-maps api key. I think the first stage after replacing oc11xml should contain the logging possiblity at least and be in the next feature release. What do you think? The background implementation shouldn't be to hard (I am already very far in replacing oc11xml). What I am most unsure about is the settings part.

		A facebook user reports he used to deactivate the setting &quot;User Google Navigation&quot; (or similar) in older releases to avoid using Google Navigation but to start another app (&quot;co pilot&quot; in his case). The user does now say that he does not have this possibility anymore with 2013.03.04 and the setting is no longer present. I can also confirm that the option is gone, but I do not remember the reason for it. Using the &quot;Use external map&quot; allows the user to open &quot;co pilot&quot; but does not transfer the destination coords. Does anyone know when and why this option was removed ?

		I just tried the patch from issue #2640 in the current nightly: I would appreciate having a possibility to filter out stored caches e.g. in search results. It works great. However sometimes the search result does not show full details below the cachename. (&quot;GC... -&quot; instead of &quot;GC... - D 1.5 - T 1.5 - Regular - Offline&quot;) In this case the filter has no effects. If I manually open and close an offline cache the details appear. Is this an intended behavior? Is there a workaround for this?

		Using todays nightly 2013.04.28 I opened the TB33C8K. The newest log contains two photos. If you now scroll down to some older logs you will see, that an older log seems to contain the same photos (same description) which is not the case. Furthermore if you continue to scroll up and down through the logs the link to the attached photos in the newest log is increased by an additional link each time it comes into view. (sorry, hard to describe). So finally if you continuosly scroll up and down you get more and more of the same photo link on the log entries.

		On support mail and facebook users often claim to have the problem, that the date display in logbook (below the username) is truncated on their device. I do not have this problem, but I think it will depend on device type, font size and date format style (different separators). A user on facebook came up with the idea to just shorten the year to a two digit style in general to avoid this problem. This means to change e.g. 28.12.2012 to 28.12.12. What do you think ? Is that technically possible ?

		Originally I posted this to #1246, but it's closed issue, so I'm opening new one. My girlfriend has Huawei Ascend G300, ICS 4.0.3, and I'm not able to setup offline map on microsd. The device has internal memory in /sdcard/ and also in /mnt/sdcard/. Microsd can be found in /mnt/sdcard2/. C:geo doesn't even search /mnt/sdcard2/ and if I fill path manually (to directory only or *.map file), it doesn't accept file and the Offline map option is still grayed out. Map file is valid for sure, it works well in Locus. BTW map also worked in c:geo before - I set it up earlier in older version about half a year ago, but last week I moved it from card's root to its own directory to clean up the mess, and it stopped working and can't be set up again.

		The user should not be allowed to select the checkbox of the &quot;..&quot; entry (or OK should be disabled, whatever is easier). This will lead to effectively unreadable pathes, like &quot;/sdcard/..&quot;. While those can always be typed manually, we should avoid creating them using our browsing activity.

		It would be great to have all the cache statuses in separated checkboxes. So instead of only &quot;exclude own and found caches&quot; and disabled caches, have one for everyone: own, found, disabled, archived. I often want to be able to see my own caches to keep track of them, but not the ones i have found, And the archived ones probably never comes back, so i dont want to see them either.

		Hello, Here is the pb and the way to reproduce it. Pre-requisite : be an owner for a cache on gc.com: delete a cache waypoint in CGeo: download cache (or remove it then download it again) =&gt; the deleted waypoint is here! See cache: http://coord.info/GC3WRQT where there are only 2 waypoints on GC.com and 3 downloaded and displayed in CGEO.

		As I believe that the integration and rework of GCBabble is a huge effort, I've now implemented our own speaking service. Can be started and stopped from the menu of the compass (and runs as long as the compass activity only). Currently it updates the voice output every 30 seconds and tells you &quot;11 o'clock, 270 meters&quot;. The voice output probably makes absolutely no sense in other languages than German and English, as it will use your locale for the voice, but the English text (as there are no other translations yet). Have fun.

			<description>
		Improvement proposal for the speech output function recently integrated by @Bananeweizen : Currently a fixed interval of 30s is implemented. The GCBabble offered a settings for this (which I do not suggest to implement) and also an adaptive speaking (which does not work for me or I do not know how it is supposed to work). After thinking a bit about it my idea would be: Implement an adaptive speaking interval which triggers an output each time the distance to target has decreased or increased by a certain value and only keep the minimum interval at 30 (or 20 ?) seconds in case of no movement (distance does not change or change of distance is below the aforementioned limit). I would propose the following distance steps for that (to be discussed) assuming a walking navigation: 1000m distance: 200m 500-1000m distance: 100m 200-500m distance: 50m 100m-200m distance: 20m 0-100m distance: 10m As the speed output itself takes some time there has to be a lower limit of 5s anyway to avoid triggering the next output while the first is still running.

		May I wish for a new feature? Right now if I chose to display circles on the map, a circle is displayed around each and every feature (finals, waypoints, original coordinates). In a densely populated area the map can get rather crowded and it is hard to see which circle belongs to which object, making it difficult to find a free spot to place a new cache. It would be really cool, if the 161m-circles around caches would only be displayed around physical objects like finals (of traditionals and user-entered final coordinates of multis and mysteries) and stages of multicaches, because only with those physical stages the 161m-rule is important. You might add a new option to display circles around everything or only around physical stages.

		I suggest we move our location provider code to the compatibility package and only use it on devices where no google play services are available.

		Especially handy for exporting and sharing GPX files with caching buddies would be the ability to filter the cache list by distance. That way, I'm sending only a few dozen nearby caches in the GPX instead of my entire list of 500+.

		When the nightly is invoked from a mail to open that cache in c:geo, it does only show &quot;Cache&quot; as title below the c:geo icon (instead of &quot;Import into c:geo&quot; or something like that, as before). This is due to my refactoring to let every activity have its title declared in the manifest instead of in the Java code of the activity. To cleanly fix this new problem, I suggest to introduce a new activity for opening a cache from a hyperlink. That new activity would then only handle the intent, and afterwards forward to the cache details activity.

		Some users made me aware, that on devices without magnetic compass sensor our compass wont point to the direction of the cache while walking but does while driving/biking. My assumption is, that we try to get the direction from that not existing sensor (in case the speed is below the coded limit). Is there a possibility to always use GPS for those devices without having the user to select it ?

		The PlayStore suggested to add localized screenshots to improve the customer experience. I will assign myself and will produce these screenshots if time permits. Today I found the time to start the &quot;production&quot; and upload of up to date screenshots. I tried to keep it common for all languages and took similar screenshots of: Main screen Live map (in a major city of that country) Live map popup Cache details Compass Search screen Nearby search Logging screen I added them for the following languages up to now: English German French Czech Swedish Dutch Italian Polish Hungarian Japanese Spanish Portuguese Danish Pleas take a look and give me feedback if something is not OK.

		I had a discussion with a lot of users today. They had a proposal for the UI: Currently on live map we always show found caches with the small smile overlay at the top left. From live map parsing we will only get the information that a cache is found but not the type as the icon on the map is only a big smile. I suggest to replace the smile overlay on top left with a full smile icon in case the cache type is unkown and its status is found (only this case!) because: It is more visible on map then the small overlay with its grey background. It is hard to distinguish between ?? unfound and ?? found. The ?? always shows that we miss some information. But the user will be able to obtain it anyway when clicking on it. I thought a while about this proposal because this would make the UI kind of inconsistent as we would show a big smile for unknown types and a small smile for known types. But still the fact remains that I don't like this lot of ??-caches on map which are in fact only found caches and thats the only valueable information for the user. What do you think ? I would like your feedback.

		If you leave a personal note, Cgeo seems to save it at first, but if you press refresh or change its status for example after you have found it and log it. It then disappears and you may lose vital information whilst in the field caching! It only remains in place if you have previously entered it from the Geocaching.com website.

		A user reported this and I can confirm this with my tablet. In the previous versions there used to be an android zoom icon where the user can select whether he wants &quot;Zoom to fit&quot; or &quot;Expand view&quot; (or similar translation). With version 2013.05.18 this option is gone and c:geo is always running &quot;Expand view&quot;. Basically this is OK as it is the &quot;better&quot; option, but some users on support mail are missing the &quot;Zoom to fit&quot; option to have bigger letters and thus make some parts more readable.

		Using NB 2013.05.20: After scrolling several times up and down through the listing of GC4BRWM suddenly the logbook entries were no longer matching the username next to it. This means e.g. that the username &quot;ApproV&quot; who initially published the cache was suddenly shown as the user who wrote the FTF-log. It seems something gets misaligned after scrolling so that username and their corresponding log entries get out of sequence.

		Bonjour, j'utilise un Garmin A50 sous Android : 2 questions : 1- Quand j'ouvre la carte CGEO mes caches placées et celles que j'ai découvertes apparaissent bien que dans les paramètres je demande qu'elles soient cachées. Je ne suis pas Premium. Est-ce la raison ??? 2- Quand je trouve des caches je l'enregistre dans le carnet off-line. Quand je rentre et passe en Wi-Fi ou en 3G y-a-t-il une possibilité pour les envoyer en un seul bloc, sans devoir les ouvrir une par une ? D'avance merci. Vincent Google translation: Hello, I use a Garmin A50 Android 2 questions: 1 - When I open my map CGEO caches placed and those that I discovered that appear in the settings I ask that they be hidden. I'm not Premium. Is that the reason?? 2 - When I find caches I record in the book offline. When I come home and go into Wi-Fi or 3G is there a possibility to send in one piece without having to open them one by one? In advance thank you. Vincent

		I can no longer use c:geo for geocaching, because c.geo tells me it's unable to log in. I cannot understand it. I can search and watch geocaches, and I can save them to my phone, but I can not navigate to them because c:geo can not log in. I can not use offline maps either. I can use Groundspeak's geocahing.com app, but not c:geo. I am frustrated. I really loved c:geo.

		I intend to replace the standard test runner in the test project by this one: http://zutubi.com/source/projects/android-junit-report/ Main reason: It can create JUnit XML reports, which should make our Jenkins output more readable and hopefully lead to better tracking of the tests. When this has been committed, you may run into an Eclipse error, when launching your unit test launch configuration (something about a test runner not being specified). Use Project -&gt; Run configurations and edit the run configuration to use the com.zutubi.... test runner. Ant users should be fine.

		When you click on a cache or trackable in your browser then c:geo is registed as a potential application to handle the url. In a recent change 74fce89 (AndroidManifest.xml) the name of the different activities were changed. Previously the name was always &quot;c:geo&quot;. Now it is &quot;Cache&quot; or &quot;Trackable&quot; depending on the type of url. I think the real application name should be displayed in this dialog. It is currently very annoying that c:geo appear as 1st item (Cache) and 2nd item (Trackable) since the ordering is alphabetical and &quot;Chrome&quot; is the other item in the list.

		I propose that we rename our c-geo-opensource repository to cgeo. We are now the sole c:geo implementation on the market, and we are as open-source as other applications present on GitHub, and those don't add &quot;-opensource&quot; to their name. Up until one week ago, this would have been a complex operation as all the checked-out repositories, URL and so on would have to be modified. However, GitHub introduced the repository redirects which take care of automatically forwarding HTTP or git requests made to the old address to the new one. It means that it should be a transparent operation for everyone using our repository, and we do not have to rush to edit our webpages with the new repository address since the old ones will work as well.

		There are some issues that are best discussed asynchronously between developers. Right now, we have a forum, but several people, me included, almost never access it because it forces us to use different tools than everyday tools and I see it as a burden. I propose we create a replacement cgeo-dev Google Groups (because it also has a web-forum-like interface for those who like it and let you chose the rate of notifications) with the following characteristics: targeted towards cgeo developers, testers, community managers, etc., everyone involved in the development and the life of cgeo (that includes planning for developers meetups, etc.); private, with consensual admission for new members (no huge secrets will be exchanged, so we can be pretty liberal about it). What do you all think about that?

Would it be an option to think about implementing such a feature ? For PM it is a very convenient method of managing PQs in combination with later import to c:geo.

		Given the placement of the &quot;Drop&quot; option on the cache details screen and in the cache list entry long-press context menu, it might make sense to have an optional confirmation message (probably off by default) for dropping stored cache data. I know a c:geo user who accidentally dropped a few caches by accidentally tapping the wrong option, and it was a very frustrating experience due to the complete lack of a nearby Internet connection.

The nearby result does not show any distances in this case. All are using the newest market versionm, all are BM , all deinstalled and reinstalled the app, but the problem is persistent. I am waiting for logs, screenshots and maybe a video of the problem. Until then tagging as &quot;Unverified&quot;.

		I always stumble over SearchResult.addCache. It adds the geocode and stores the cache into db. The name should mention this. I suggest: addAndPutInCache(Geocache cache) Why? Developers often didn't realize that addCache stores the Geocache to save memory and only adds geocode to SearchResult. GCParser.parseFromText added the cache to SearchResult without setting it detailed (until I fixed it). This led to parsedCache.gatherMissingFrom(storedCache) overwriting parsed information with cache data load from db (old).

		From time to time single users are reporting that bold font is displayed only blurred and almost unreadable. Logs are affected as well as the cache description. Recently I discussed with a user and found the following facts: Using Samsung Galaxy S3 with Stock-ROM (same as mine) Android 4.1.2 Newest market release Problem is not reproducible but once it occurs only force stop and restart of c:geo solves the problen I have the same phone but can not reproduce this. I am still in chat with the user trying to find out more details. So I open this issue for me as a reminder and for you in case you have any idea for that. Screenshots: Cache: Cache description:

		There are some problems when checking/adjusting colors in the cache description. There is no handling of white fonts when using light skin. This gives this problem: The checks are for color=. This causes incorrect matches on bgcolor=. This is what causes this cache to get a gray background even though it doesn't have black text. To solve part 2, I first thought to change it to color= with a leading space, but this doesn't have to be true, so I am thinking about maybe stripping all bgcolor from the text before checking for color but I don't want to make a second copy of the entire text in memory again. Any feedback?

		I suggest to set the default value of &quot;Load long description automatically&quot; to true. This option was mainly used for performance tuning in the past. Meanwhile our code is better and smartphones are better, so from the usability point of view, a user should have this enabled by default in new installations. Any more settings, where you think the default should be different?

		We retrieved some mails that logging is not OK with the release version. It could be a result of the site update from yesterday. I just tested it myself with version 2013.05.22 and can reproduce that. c:geo says &quot;Log sucesful&quot; but updating the cache details afterwards the log is not shown. Also on the webpage there is no new log. Feel free to test with GC352Y3 Log will follow.

		Today on FB Tobias Andersson Hey and thanks for the awesome work you put in to this. However, I just upgraded to a Galaxy S4 and there is something wrong with the icons on the livemap. The little floppydisc that indicates that the cache is saved on the phone is about four times bigger and blurry as sh*t compared to how it looks on my S3. It is, of course, mostly an esthetical issue but it's kinda hard to see what type of cache it is when the floppyicon blocks out more than half the circle. :) Hopefully it's an easy fix (or maybe it's just something wrong with my phone, anyone else got this?) Tobias Andersson I suspect it got something to do with the higher resolution on the S4 but what do I know. Tobias Andersson Looked into it and it goes for all of the &quot;add-on&quot;-icons. The floppy, the smiley etc.

		The new connector always tries to do OAuth level 3 authentication, even for methods where this is not needed. That leads to the situation that one can no longer search for OC1234 from the quick search or search. We should only use the OAuth authentication, if the method really requires it, otherwise we enforce the user to authentication.

		HTC One Developer Edition, Android 4.1.2. A couple of weeks ago I briefly tried c:geo on this new phone. Seemed to work alright. Now, with latest update, it won't display any caches on the map. I've tried Live Map, Nearby and Search. It will bring up a list of caches, but when selecting &quot;Map&quot; it won't show any. Changing the Map View option doesn't help. It is not automatically centering the map on my current location when doing Nearby or Live View. When performing an address search it isn't automatically centering map on the searched location. Regardless, it isn't showing any cache on the map when I manually center map to my location or to the searched location.

		Hi, i am using the &quot;send via email&quot; feature to &quot;mark&quot; found caches. I don't like to write my foundlogs on the road, so i send found caches via email to myself and post my logs at home on my pc. so it would be nice to have the link to the post-page in the email. there is not mucht to do there, just put the link as following into the email: http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?WP={$GCCODE} maybe this could be optional? thanks

		As mentioned in #2380 the GPX import is slow even if all extra features (like static maps, gc vote, logs from friends) are disabled. With profiling we managed to figure out this happens if caches are already stored in the database. The main slowdown is when logs of the cache are read before import, which is pointless if they get overwritten. http://pbrd.co/11kuRbZ Trace: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o41h76anf06wa95/ddms7173376374349962084.zip

		This is entered for tracking purposes. If a BM does a Nearby search, then the distance is approximated as we don't have the cache coords. If a BM does a search by location, then the distance shown is in reference to where the search was done, not the user. Example: Go into Search Enter somewhere into the Address box and Search (I entered Hamburg) In the resulting list, the caches show as several hundred feet away instead of several thousand miles I'd suggest this limitation entered into the FAQ.

When you open a list of PQs: http://www.geocaching.com/pocket/default.aspx you get a list of all PQs Every PQ has a link to &quot;Preview&quot; the PQ (as nearby search http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx?pq=xyz ) Users would like to see that list as nearby search.

We could automatically request login page as open in browser or add open in browser as login. I didn't check if it's possible but they use a parameter &quot;redir&quot;

		For testing I also changed to german and tested the switch to english. c:geo switched to english sucessful but I did not see this in the debug logs. It reported 23:20:26.781 Info cgeo 9078  Geocaching.com language already set to English
 but it seemed to have performed the switch. Can someone check the logging for that case ? That could be helpful some time.

		During my tests due to the log date problem I have seen that I got logged out while the app was still open but idle. Long time I experienced nothing like this. I opened the log page for a cache I got the error message that c:geo can not load the log page In the log I see a 500 error while loading the log page Trying at the PC I can enforce the 500 by logging out from the page and then trying to load the logpage. So it seems my login expired/invalidated for some reason. I assume this is a fault at the website but we should keep an eye on that. Currently this error is not handled. We could e.g. trigger a relogin in case a 500 error is received.

		While testing another thing I have seen this NPE in the logs. The WPs are not parsed any longer. It was working some NBs ago and I did not change my note until then. My personal note is Alte Koordinaten:

E 007 02.675
Neue Koordinaten:
N 51 21.168
E007 02.840
 Note: I altered the coords due to security for my mystery ;) , but I assume that makes no difference. This is the log: 22:53:27.953 Error cgeo 7476  Geocache.parseWaypointsFromNote

		c:geo version 2013.05.31a I copied *.zip files to my phone via USB cable. Import folder was chosen. c:geo does not see *zip files. Previously it worked when I changed the extension to gpx even if it was still zip file. a) First of all all found gpx files are shown twice b) importing gpx does not work: 'Cannot parse .gpx file as GPX 1.1: could no parse XML' On the other hand, imports works when I send email myself with changed extension to GPX (gmail does not like *.zip), click 'Download', next c:geo as a program to use with this action. In a new version it could be nice if at least offline logs will be possible for opencaching.pl OC caches which work currently with c:geo. Thanks for correcting it!

		c:geo is able to load GPX files from opencaching.pl. However, there is no option to log found caches offline. I understand that online logging may be difficult to implement, but offline should be easy and is enough to be able to log caches manually online at home. Opencaching.pl asks as well for time in addition to date.

		This question was raised now several times on support mail, therefore I would like to bring it here to get your feedback: There are users who store their GPX file collection or pocket queries on Dropbox and are asking if it is possible to offer a direct import over the Dropbx app. I have actually no idea if this is technically possible at all.

		As we discussed somewhere (probably on IRC) gc.com currently tests a new cache page design. So some (randomly selected) users are already redirected to that URL. The URL is different (no cache_details.aspx): http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3FJ5F Furthermore the content has changed a little. I think they will either set this one as a default or fall back in the next days. I have no idea whether they will go to that new URL but I think the current URL is just a temporary solution for testing and the content will later move to the current URL. However maybe someone can look at the content with respect to parsing changes ?

		Using cgeo on new blackberry Q10. As we logged out visits, cgeo displayed a message saying the log was successfully uploaded showed our log at the top of the list of logs When we signed in to geocaching.com's website, none of the logs had been actually uploaded. Back at the Q10, we refreshed one of these caches inside cgeo. Our log disappeared from the list of logs. :( Things we tried: restarting the Q10; did not fix the problem confirming that &quot;Enable offline&quot; was NOT checked; did not fix repeating the process with other caches; did not fix submitting a log on the same account from cgeo on my Google Nexus: this works fine. confirmed Q10 roaming and data were enabled; device is able to send and receive data Happy to help debug this. Let me know what else I can test/tell you. ;-)

		This issue introduces the AndroidAnnotation library in our project: https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations Main goal: Reduce code clutter by implementing standard android patterns trough annotations. This is done by generating code from the annotation. There is no runtime penalty and you can debug through the generated code. Eclipse and Ant build have been customized by me, so this should build on everyones machine. Someone using IntelliJ might want to read https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations/wiki/IntelliJIDEA.

		Hello first, sorry for my bad english and sorry too if my post is not an issue and if it's not in the good section. I don't know if i can write it here. I have a problem with distances with a smartphone zopo with android : all caches have several distances for the same point. I saw this in the FAQ : The distance to a cache is fluctuating heavily For some users the distance to a cache in a list of caches or in the compass is jumping between some meters to some kilometers. You are probably running Cyanogenmod ROM. This is a known bug in Cyanogenmod 10. More information can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=6883 So you either have to wait for a fix for this ROM or change to another ROM. The link doesn't work. i'm not using a cyanogen ROM. Do you now if there is an issue for this problem ? Thanks for your answer

		Do we want to add an information to our IRC channel to the c:geo website ? This would allow users to contact us for support via chat. Most questions on support mail are easy to solve/answer, but for more complicated issues it would be nice to have a direct chat contact. I don't think that many users would use it however for those with really difficult issues it would be helpful. Can we add a link on http://www.cgeo.org/contact.html ? I could also add a link to our FAQ (e.g. &quot;I have a really difficult problem with c:geo. Where to get help?&quot;)

		I tried to use the ability of setting up several lists like follows: For the mysteries that I have solved I created a new list &quot;solved&quot;. I moved all the solved mysteries to that list. Afterwards I was able to have a quick look where is the next solved mystery the I can search for now. That worked pretty good for me. However after I received the next time my home-zone PQ and imported that to the standard list, all the solved mysteries were moved to the standard list back and did not show up in the &quot;solved&quot; list any more. Do you have an idea how to keep the solved mysteries in the related list also?

		This sounds like a strange request because why not add a waypoint? Well the reason is as follows. On multiple locations I have received coordinates in email, text, or even from OCRing a picture. I copy and paste the text into the 'personal note' of the cache. But now it does not become a waypoint. If the text was in the 'personal note' before (on the website) and it would load, it would have become a waypoint. So the easy request. Can we extract coordinates when entering the personal note in C:geo. this allow me to copy and paste a large number of coordinates at once using copy/paste and not have to make a lot of individual waypoints.

		I searched for a similar request, but I couldn't find one. I would like to be able to see if a cache would need me to bring some tools (to climb, to dive, to swim, ...) when I look at the live map. Unfortunately the attributes of caches could not be used for this as not all caches are using attributes in the same way. (a climbing cache could miss the &quot;climbing required&quot; attribute although the description tells me to climb) Currently the best way to solve the problem is using several lists for each kind of tag I am using and then showing only this list in the live map. There are several downsides of this. (a cache can only have one tag at a time; caches from the normal live map can't be distinguished) Short term improvements: *A list could have a symbol. Each cache in the list would be displayed along with the symbol. *One could manually add tags to caches. An according symbol would make the tag visible in the live map. Long term improvements: *One could reuse the mechanism for a global filter system (issue #995) to use a filter result as dynamic tag. (a search could be combined like: attribute = &quot;climbing required&quot; OR owner = &quot;climbing only&quot; OR GC-Code = GC1234, GC5678) *Cache appearance (color, shape, symbol) could be determined by filters too. (Source = OC -&gt; shape quadratic; Terrain = T5 -&gt; color red) These are only my ideas of the topic. I would love to hear what you think of it.

		We should not include any further big feature for the next release, but get the current new stuff finished and polished. Please add issues to this list directly, if you see them blocking the next release. @Lineflyer added #2122 Personal Note synchronization. #2826 From my users/testers perspective I think needs to be solved as well (The problem, that on empty tiles for PM we are still showing them if retrieved on lower zoom) What about #2821 which came in probably after the new basic member nearby search implementation? @Bananeweizen added: #2898 #2770 #2443 #2747 @Lineflyer added: #2925 #2926 #2932 #3000 #2996 #2606 #3086 #3104 #3111 #3136 @samueltardieu added: #2915 A release from the release branch with the end-of-line warning must be done first

		This issue is for discussing whether to raise the minimum SDK level to run cgeo from 4 to 7 (or higher). Current play store stats show minimal usage among level 4 devices (I believe this just means they have it installed, not necessarily actively using it). Reasons to upgrade: Allows supporting multi-window feature on Samsung devices (see #2443) Allows using [ActionBarSherlock]((http://actionbarsherlock.com/) to implement action bar functionality in cgeo. It supports minimum of level 7. Note: Google is planning to release an action bar support library (ActionBarCompat), but I haven't seen details for what versions it will support or when it will be released. The current sample project in the SDK runs on level 4. Other API functionality we could use? Reasons not to upgrade: Users of devices prior to level 7 will no longer be able to use cgeo. They could run current version until changes to gc.com render it unusable. Please post any thoughts and discussion.

		There seem to be some caches (virtual) which require a passkey/keyword in order to place found logs. Example: OCB68A In c:geo I can compose a found log (I did not send it because I did not really visit it), on the website I need the passkey to post a found log. I don't know whether the API supports this and I don't know whether I can post a found log via c:geo even without entering the password.

		I am using nightly build 2013.06.14-NB-76f59b8 There has been a change in the waypoints are handled, and I vote to return it to the previous method. The change: long press on a waypoint takes a user straight to the edit screen. The problem: there is no means to navigate to the waypoint other than by the default means - the small compass icon on the waypoint view. In previous versions, a long press on the waypoint would provide the navigation menu, and options such as navigate(driving) would be availble. I cannot find a means to achieve this any more. Example: I have a puzzle cache with modified co-ordinates. When stored in c:geo, the original co-ordinates are also stored, and these can often be the parking place for access to the cache which I use to access my driving navigation application. It maybe related to this, but when a waypoint is selected on the map view, a menu -&gt; navigate also takes the user directly to the default navigation took (Radar in my case). Previously I was presented with the navigate selection menu. Please can I have it back :)

		When I go geocaching I just save an offline log on the field and then logs online back at home using my computer. The found caches is now listed in the History List så I know in wich order they were found. But as soon as I view the cache page for a cache found for a time ago it is also added to the list. This messes up the current &quot;found but not logged&quot; count and I have missed a planned milestone cache because of this bahavior. I have two possible change suggestions: Only include caches in the list that was found since the History was cleared last time Add a section for each found date in the list. With a counter for each section. ie: Today [2] Cache name no 1 Cache name no 2 2012-01-03 [1] Cache name no 3

		Some time ago the live map had some debugging information in the title bar if &quot;Debug log&quot; was active in settings. Somehow this seems to be removed. I suggest to reimplement this, in order to allow better testing and better supporting users with live map problems. What is needed: If &quot;Debug log&quot; is active in setting the headline of the livemap should display something like that: Z=zoomlevel requested, s=Strategy applied, lat=Latitude requested, lon=longitude requested

		I would like to suggest to clean up the list management menu to a clear structure by using some sub menus and other methods instead. The current situation is partly inconsistent and looks a bit overfreighted. Current situation: Drop all Drop all and delete list Suggestion: Drop all only and have an option for additionally deleting the list in the following confirmation dialog Current situation: Import GPX Import from web Suggestion: Import as main entry (like already for export) with sub items GPX/LOC and Web When one/some caches are selected the management menu still shows the options Import GPX and Import from Web These can be removed at this spot, as they have nothing to do with managing the selection and are probably never used from here.

		Activate compass &quot;Start speech&quot; As long as the output is running I can change the volume of the output In the pauses between the output the volume change buttons on my device only change the ringtone volume I was not sure, whether this is a technical limitation, therefore I crosschecked with the original GCBabble and there it is possible to change the output volume also during speech pauses. I think this should also be possible within c:geo. Typically when using loudspeaker you may want to reduce the volume before the next output starts (e.g. in case you walk into a crowd of people) but you actually can not do that but just reduce your ringtone volume instead.

		Since we are now always merging release to master my previous method of periodically manually updating the release notes on master is no longer possible. I used to update release notes on release- and master branch independently depending on where the changes have been applied. I liked that method to just keep track of the changes included in master only. @rsudev told that we can get a list of commits only on master via github. My questions now would be: How to get that list of changes? How and when to transform the commit list into a list of &quot;user readable&quot; list of changes ?

		From FB: When one exits the map and enter the cachedescription for logging and then enters the map afterwards the trace is gone. Request: Track on map log. Would like a track log that shows the track even if one have closed the map and opened it once again. Just like a track log on a real GPS. Reasson: Have been some places where mapcoverage isn't good and would like the possibilities to &quot;backtrace&quot; ones footsteps. Also when leaving the live map by using the back key the trail is lost. It would be could to keep it running/saved as long as c:geo is active with a menu option on the map menu to clear it.

		Right now settings for offline maps (directory for *.map, themes) are located in the section &quot;map&quot;. I would suggest to move these detailed items to a new group within the section &quot;offline data&quot; and only leave the map source selection itself on the &quot;map&quot; section. By doing so, all items relevant for offline use are at the same location.

		For all settings which require the specification of file paths (e.g. offline map path, GPX import/export path, etc.) it seems there is no longer the possibility to manually enter a path. Bug reports from users have shown in the past that (on some strange devices at least) it can be necessary to do so, because either the dirscanner (offline maps) or the dirchooser (export/import) does not scan/show all existing file structures.

		I know from the past (but do not find that issue at the moment) that we currently have two different dirchooser methods. On one hand a dirchosser with black background and selection boxes and another one (which probably cam out of another library) with more graphical design. Those two have been somehow mixed in the past, e.g. the initial dir selection was done using one style, the change of an exisiting path was done using the other style. Within the new settings we now constantly use the dirchooser with black background (the old one) but not the graphical dirchosser. Has that been done intentional?

		Currently important options like export/import and backup/restore are hidden in the section &quot;more settings&quot; which could probably be seen by the user as optional or advanced settings but currently contains a mixture of miscellaneous settings. I am not a friend of these kind of sections as most probably everything which does not fit into an existing section will be appended there...like a wastebin ;) I suggest to have at least one other section &quot;System&quot; and move GPX Export/Import Backup / Restore Location for database Debugging option to there. The section &quot;More settings&quot; should then indeed only contain something like advanced settings which are optional.

		There is a test which fails every now and then on Jenkins: http://ci.cgeo.org/job/c-geo/882/testReport/junit/cgeo.geocaching/GeocacheTest/testUpdateWaypointFromNote/ But that one uses only local data, network is not involved. I'm really puzzled what could be wrong there. I already tried storing and deleting that specific cache, but no changes. Anyone else with an idea? I' m looking at this since quite a while already and don't an idea anymore....

		This is not especially related to the new setting as it was like that also in the old settings: Currently the user can not see, whether he already successfully performed an authorization to that services. The string &quot;Authorize c:geo&quot; somehow always indicates to me that no authorization has been done yet. A possible implementation could be to change that string to &quot;Reauthorize c:geo&quot; in case authorization has already been performed or have a visual indication (green tick, etc.) next to it.

		I first noticed that while caching on the event in Koblenz together with the c:geo team. Today I did some more fieldtesting with the TTS function: As long as I use &quot;GPS + Compass&quot; mode the TTS output for the direction is always accurate (i.e. same as shown on the compass rose). If I use &quot;GPS only&quot; (which is meaningful for using it in some pocket and listen only) the direction shown and TTS output of it is different from each other most of the time. I did not manage to find any logic in it beside one thing: If I am not moving and switch to &quot;GPS only&quot; (this will not get any meaningful direction shown as movement is necessary to calculate the GPS direction towards the cache) the direction shown and TTS output of it are identical. If I now start moving the displayed direction changes immediately but the spoken direction seems to remain as it was or only catch up after a long time. I set this to &quot;medium&quot; as using &quot;GPS only&quot; mode is pretty helpful in combination with TTS output.

		In #3001 @koem wants to fix the issue that there is an action bar in landscape but not in portrait by removing it in landscape as well. IMHO there must be an action bar because there is an option menu and you cannot open it on newer Android versions.

		Hi, I have a big problem... I have a new mobile phone (Android Version 4.2.1, Kernel 3.4.5) and had to discover that the distance of a chosen cache in the compass view varies very much (i.e. 100m to &gt;10 km). The same happens if I view the list of saved caches on the phone... the caches wildly change their order in the menu.. very interesting to choose a cache... Also if I search for caches in the live map the scaling bar changes its scale new sometimes and switches back now and then... Changing the used maps does not help... (Thought it would help, but it doesn't and wrote that in a mail to the support)... Still- I do not see any such effects when using googlemaps directly and everything seems to be fine with the implemented GPS (no jumping in google maps or orux maps when tracking)... Help, please! :(

		Hi, I am just curious... Is possible to show GeoKrety trackables in Geocaching caches? I think it is not implemented yet because I didnt see Geokret which was in my last cache in cgeo in trackables... but it was shown on GC.com websites with GeoKrety plugin...¨ Thank you

		Hello! My problem is, as stated in the title, that c:geo seems to use my phones gps even when it's closed. By default my gps tracking is switched off and I turn it on manually when I go GC hunting. When I've found what I've been looking for (using this great app), I turn off the gps tracking and close c:geo. However I've noticed that even after I've closed the app and turned gps tracking off it still seems to use the gps somehow. When I check the use details of c:geo under battery usage it shows that it still uses gps and drains battery accordingly. The gps usage time (and battery drain) won't stop until I've done a full phone restart, even force closing the app won't help, only restart. Anyone else having this issue (or is it an issue at all or am I doing something wrong)? I tried to search for similar topics, but couldn't find any. I'm new to c:geo, but I've found it to be a great app already, just hate to restart my phone after using c:geo just to conserve my battery. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I'm using c:geo (ver. 2013.06.05) on my galaxy nexus (android 4.2.2). Sorry if I'm in the wrong place with this, so feel free to redirect/delete/whatnot if so ;) Thanks, Runkha

		I discovered this while working on #2234. Scroll to an area where you found many caches on the live map, and the outer ones will load as ?? caches because the details aren't important. If you click one, the pop-up loads some more details about it, but it loses track of the &quot;Found&quot; status on the cache. Now, if you close the pop-up, the smiley face indicating that the cache was found is missing. This also affects my fix for #2234; if you select a ?? cache which was found, and then click &quot;Hide own/found caches&quot;, that cache will not disappear with all the other ones. Clicking &quot;More Details&quot; in the pop-up (causing it to load that information again) will fix the problem. The cache status needs to be downloaded when clicking the pop-up, or the &quot;Found&quot; status needs to be kept somewhere. I'll try to fix this.

		When using MTK 6589 powered phone the distance data gets crazy. At one moment You are located 40 meters from cache, few seconds later You are located 500m from it and after less than a second You came back. This makes it difficult to use the app. This is well known problem for many apps with phones powered by this CPU. RunKeeper is one of the apps working correctly, Endomondo is the example of the one working wrong. There must be some kind of problem with interpreting the data from GPS.

		Currently the option &quot;since last export&quot; in the field note upload dialog will only activate the appropriate checkbox on geocaching.com fieldnote page. This has some disadvantages: The checkbox is only existing on the webpage if there are still pending logs (it can be used to add more notes to an already exisiting list of pending notes only). If a user exports field notes from c:geo, logs all the notes on gc.com and later exports again as he has new offline logs, all stored offline logs will be again shown on gc.com (old ones and new ones). We could delete the offline logs in c:geo once the export and upload is OK, but as exporting them does not mean logging them, this might raise other problems. So saving an own timestamp of the last export (not use the gc.com feature) and exporting only logs newer than that sound like a better way.

		By now we explicitly support around 12 different navigation apps and tools (e.g. bike navigation, Oruxmaps and that stuff). While that is really nice for the people who want to invoke exactly their app, I find this menu is starting to get huge (at least on my device). As we now have better settings, it would probably make sense to add another category to the navigation screen, where each navigation app can be disabled using a checkbox. Each would be checked by default, and only for installed apps the preference would be enabled.

		It would appear that you can search for caches by name, code etc, but I was wondering if the search could include searching for caches by their difficulty or terrain rating. This way you will be able to find some of the harder to get types without having to spend ages searching online. Do you think this can be implemented in a future release, as I think it would be a great addition to the app.

		Dear developers, I am analyzing cgeo using a static code checker. I found some potential slow operations in cgeo's UI thread. Android documentation says this: http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-anr.html &quot;Any method that runs in the UI thread should do as little work as possible on that thread. In particular, activities should do as little as possible in key life-cycle methods such as onCreate(). Potentially long running operations such as network or database operations, or computationally expensive calculations such as resizing bitmaps should be done in a worker thread (e.g., via AsyncTask).&quot; I found the following event handlers transitively performing database queries, touching file systems, or compressing bitmaps: cgeo.geocaching.ImageSelectActivity.onActivityResult() cgeo.geocaching.CacheDetailActivity$DescriptionViewCreator's onClick() handler at line 1644 (revision 6e4a8d4) cgeo.geocaching.MainActivity's onLongClick() handler at line 362 cgeo.geocaching.CacheDetaiActivity$DescriptionViewCreator's onClick() handler at line 1797 cgeo.geocaching.ui.ImagesList$AsyncImgLoader onClick() listener at line 132 cgeo.geocaching.LogCacheActivity's onClick() handler at line 323 cgeo.geocaching.LogCacheActivity's onClick() handler at line 332 Do you think these slow operations will affect cgeo's performance (e.g., make GUI not smooth enough)? If yes, perhaps moving them to a separate thread can help make cgeo super smooth in user interaction. Looking forward to your reply and hope I can help improve cgeo.

		After Importing caches with waypoints it is possible to select them to edit it. But after typing in new coordninates etc. and press 'save' the app will force close. My suggestions: Don't allow to edit owner-made waypoints as long it will lead to a crash Repair that bug and make all waypoints editable. ;-) If that is not possible perhaps let the app store a copy of the orginal waypoint when saving an edit

		When you choose to sort the caches by name, it doesn't work properly. This bug seems to arrive when there are numbers in the geocache name and a number is re-used later in the name. For example, with the following names : GR8 01-01, GR8 01-02, GR8 01-03, GR8 01-04, GR8 01-05, GR8 01-06, GR8 01-07, GR8 01-08, GR8 01-09, the result will be : GR8 01-08, GR8 01-01, GR8 01-02, GR8 01-03, GR8 01-04, GR8 01-05, GR8 01-06, GR8 01-07, GR8 01-09. The example is real. It occure on a French Southwest serial of geocaches. And there are others same cases. It's not an heavy problem but thank you if you coulde resolve it. Sorry for my english. I send you a sunny memory (36 ºC) of France. Chrono81. PS : I'm waiting to be able to read the whole information of date (and not 26.07.20..) beside the logs. In version 2013.07.25, it is not yet corrected.

		I use the nightly build which I downloaded from the website and I am updating it over the in-app-notification. Although I deinstalled the playstore-version before installing the nightly the nightly seemes to me conneceted to the playstore version. The Problem will appear if the playstore-version gets an update. If that will be installed the app don't work. Always when I try to open the live-map the complete app force close. The only possibillity to change that is to install the newest nightly build over the website again. I tried to set the playstore not to update automatically but on days with much app-update I happen sometimes that I update it manually together with al the other apps. My suggestions: prevent the nightly to connect to the playstore! repair the force-close-bugs then the versions get accidentally installed that way? perhaps upload the nightly to the playstore as a seperate app if that don't make to much work?

		On Saturday and Sunday I went for around 25 caches. All of them have been logged offline. Those logs are complete (i.e. exporting field notes or just looking at the logs in cache details is fine). But for 2 of the 25 caches the visitedDate in the cache table is zero. This leads to those 2 caches missing in the history. I've now looked back and forth through the code to find how the visitedDate might become zero. But I don't really have any clue as all the places accessing that variable seem to be fine. Therefore it would be good if someone else could watch for the same to happen. I also don't know anymore what version I used at the weekend, as it has been updated in the meantime.

		I just accidentally managed to hit the backup button in settings while sliding through the menu. Sadly there is no confirmation dialog but it just overwrites an existing backup.(which in my case has overwritten a backup of 500 caches which I did before reinstalling c:geo with a new installed DB with 0 caches).

		I copied this into an empty note in c:geo: Station 1: N50°14.759 E6°11.178
A=35
B=25
Final: Station1 + (2*B Meter in A+6 Grad)
Final: N50°14.779 E6°11.206
 After that I uploaded the note, then I refreshed the cache. That is the result Station 1: N50°14.759 E6°11.178
A=35
B=25
Final: Station1 + (2*B Meter in A+6 Grad)
Final: N50°14.779 E6°11.206

		With 2013.07.30-NB I am am no longer able to change the active map. Whatever I select I am stuck on &quot;Google Maps&quot;. Neither OSM:Online nor OSM:Offline works. The settings show my selection correctly but the map stays with GoogleMaps. I am on the road right now...will provide more details later. Can someone reproduce?

		I've just seen this on the release version: A non archived cache has been stored locally (and it has an offline log). By now the cache is archived on the website. You can refresh the cache in the app as often as you want, it doesn't get show the archived state anywhere. I cannot reproduce this currently on my own device, because for me the same cache is archived when I download it the first time. Will have to debug into that faking the non archived state first.

		Hi I have an Gem7008 Android 4.1 It does not have a GPS unit in it. I want to use it as a fast translator for Geo logs etc, away from my main Android that is too slow. When I download a pocket query and import the GPS, it says it has imported 55 caches, but will only display the 12 multicaches on the visible list. I hope you understand. Regards Derek

		There is more images that is common in http://coord.info/GC2PVN5, but not much. When trying to touch &quot;Images&quot; on the bottom of the listing on OR show all images on separate list (on cache details), c:geo falls back to cache list instead of showing images. This seems like bug. I have current c:geo on my Note II with Android 4.1.2 (JZO54K.N7100XXDME6).

		Hi, is there a reason why there is no Firefox AddOn? The idea I have is to remove the need for Greasemonkey, as I find this to be cumbersome for novice users. It would be fairly simple to do this, 5 lines with the AddOn builder and page-mod. Though, one possible issue I see with this is the update mechanism, as for each change of the script the addon would need to be updated as well, but then Firefox would update the app automatically. Furthermore I have one off-topic question, is the server side code for send2cgeo publicly available as well? Looking forward for feedback.

		Hi, Opencaching works fine, but I like do deactivate it. In the Menu, i can do this, but the past shown caches are still there and the MAP cannot be refreshed or cleaned. The problem is, that the icons won't disappear. For example, if you logged a GC Cache, the OC Icon will Overlay the GC Icon. You cannot see, if you have logged the GC Cache. So you want to be able to deactivate the OC Icon. Reconstruction of this issue: Use a GC Account in gceo add the OC Option without an account be happy to see the OC Caches. Remove the OC Option because the GC Caches are overlayed. View the result. Both Cache Types are Shown regards..

		Many times when I talk to friends about caching with android and c:geo they tell me that they don't want to lose the possibility to submit caches from a (garmin)-device to an other. The garmin-gps-devices are using ANT+ for that. Thince a few days I use a cheap (20€) ANT+Stick to recive chirp-signals on my smartphone (using &quot;ant usb service&quot;, the app &quot;cache beacon&quot; and a small usb cable). It whould be nice to send or receive also cache-listings between c:geo and garmin. And maybe it whould be also nice to send caches from smartphome to smartphone over NFC or Bluetooth without an internet connection.

		I opened the live map today with 2013.08.03-NB and while loading I noticed the following: In the first phase the map was populated from PNG parsing and caches appeared with orange circle After that a nearby search was triggered and the orange circles disappeared for those 20 caches So far, so good but: I can verify that caches parsed with an incorrect type are not corrected (see screenshot where an Earth cache is shown, but it is an Webcam cache) I am quite sure, that I have seen that none of the icon position moved on the map. This would mean that the precise coords from the nearby search do not replace the approximated coords from the parsing. But I am not sure of this issue right now.

		Hi... Since a few days I have the following problem: Live map = OSM. Choose a cache from map, start navigation (from cache preview or detailed view) --&gt; black screen for 2.. 3.. seconds, then cgeo jumps back to live map. Live map = Google Navigation starts correct. Now I can change the map to OSM, everything works fine. When I go back to the live map, Google is still displayed. Choose another cache, start navigation, cgeo uses OSM. Go back to live map --&gt; still Google. Change live map now to OSM --&gt; same problem like in case 1. Tried: New Installation of cgeo from app store and the current Nightly Builds Version: 2013.08.04-NB-62677dd. Downloaded new OSM maps here: http://download.mapsforge.org/maps/europe/germany/ Using Android V 4.1.2 Help :)

		Just a question/proposal: It seems currently send2cgeo is running on the same server where also the webserver and Jenkins is hosted. This is most probably @mucek4 home. send2cgeo seems to get more popular recently and our user base is growing. On the last outage of the webserver we got several complaints about this. Wouldn't it make sense to host it where status.cgeo.org is hosted?

		The talking compass function tells the direction to the cache in relation to the compass direction. You therefore have to point your smartphone to a specific direction such that the compass direction is a meaningful value, right? The direction output &quot;3 o'clock&quot; only makes sense if I hold the smartphone horizontally and with the upper side away from me. I would like to use the talking compass while keeping the smartphone in my pocket. This way I could approximate the cache without being noticed that I am a geocacher. I therefore suggest another direction mode which tells the bearing. Either in cardinal directions (north, north-east, east, ...) or with the pure value in degrees. This assumes that you have a slight notion on where 'north' is.

		When you used the function &quot;see the geocache off-line&quot; ( without wifi or GSM connection). When i opened the cache, i've all information on the first page (hint photo is ok). On the log pages, when an image is attached on a log, sometimes it's ok, i click on the image and i see it. But if i go on the last right page ( images page), all the images are a white block with a red cross. It's strange, on the HINT, i see the image, but on the image page, i'ts not possible... Perhaps it's an android problem and not a C:Geo problem, i dont'know. I'm on android 4.1.1

		I would like to take the posting from @BudBundi to the issuetracker to start a discussion: TB Page not correct load with vodafone DE Beitragvon BudBundi » 06 Aug 2013, 23:05 I have told that to some of you on the MEGA Eck when load a TB Page over the Vodafone DE Network it isn't showing correct. So I investigate in that a little and found that the vodafone proxy try to optimize the HTML and delete some empty divs and not used styles. You can change that when load http://perfomance.vodafone.de and change the settings to optimize off or in expert settings optimize html off. Perhaps that is something for the FAQ. Adding this to the FAQ is one point, but another point would be to compare the HTML-output with both settings and see whether we can optimize our parsing so that this optimization does not have any impact to it. As far as I know these performance proxy installation they usually only strip &quot;unnecessary&quot; HTML-content (like comments, unsued scripts, etc.) from pages and additionally compress pictures requested in that HTML before transfering it to the user. So it is somehow strange that these break our parsing. I also met a user recently with the same problem on Telekom-D1 network in Germany. So it is not specific to one operator but may spread widely with all operators using that kind of proxy. Here are the infos provided by the german network operators: D1: http://www.t-mobile.de/speedmanager/0,20641,24079-_,00.html VF:http://www.vodafone.de/business/hilfe-support/vodafone-performance-manager.html E+: Proxy introduction was stopped (AFAIK) 02: Proxy program was live but terminated after a few months (AFAIK)

		(sorry if this should be a douplicated issue, i dont found an other one with my seach before) Sometimes I have to switch from c:geo to an other app and back. For example for calculating new coordinates or making a photo. When c:geo is not active the gps gets deactivated. (Sometimes I even go to the home screen to disable gps and save energy.) After switching back to cgeo the gps needs one second to get a fix again. When I use the live-map I get a trail from N0°E0° near africa to my current position in that moment. When I switch between apps a few times (for example to calculate the next part of coordinates) there comes more and more of this trail-lines from 0° to different positions around me. At least it gets sometimes almoust impossible to see the southern part of the map. Possible solution could be to filter the 0°position from using for the trail or to filter very large jumps of the trail in little time.

		Importing a GPX works normal but importing a *.loc shows a strange behaviour: After the file has been selected the progress immediately jumps to 100%. In the log I can see that the data is being imported but at the same time the static map download is triggered for each cache. After importing is done (acc. to log) the progress for static map download is shown normally and it seems the maps are downloaded once again. So the fault is: Static maps should not be downloaded during the file import but seperately Progress indicator is wrong

		I would like to have a easy way to control which caches are displayed on the (live) map. Now we have to go to the home screen -&gt; settings and loose the current viewed positions on the map. Implementing Issue #3078 &quot;Live map should start at last position if not fixed to current position&quot; would eliminate that effect but it is still a long way to the related settings. SIMPLE SOLUTION Add a &quot;Settings&quot; button to the menu of the map. That way we can reach the settings &quot;Exclude own and found caches&quot; and &quot;Exclude disabled caches&quot; more easier. EXTENDED SOLUTION Add a submenu &quot;View&quot; like &quot;Map View&quot; to The menu. It contains a list of check boxes which enables when marked the display of the related Caches. Some ideas for Options: Own and found Disabled Whit stored Log (Caches I couldn't find) All other (hide all so we can see the map in crowded areas) From which &quot;Stored&quot; lists (submenu, giving the option to select any combinations of lists - I don't want to see caches on my 'Riddels to solve online' list out in the field.) Type (maybe submenu) Difficulty (maybe submenu whit selection of which counts of stars) Alternative this menu could be called &quot;Filter&quot; and removers the selected kinds of cached from the map.

		Hi folks, just for your information: like mentioned in #3027 the android app startet an open beta phase these days. Have a look at www.cachelab.net if you want to participate. CacheLab will be published under a closed source commercial licence. There is a JSON webservice (already active) and an open source API library (comming soon, after the beta has been finished), that can be used by other programs which want wo make use of the waypoint database of CacheLab.

		This feature would alarm me when a new cache has been hidden in some predefined area via the normal android notification mechanisms. This is like a nearby search with sorting by hiding date, newest first. But executed automatically by the AlarmManager in predefined intervals. cgeo should store the last check time and only alert about caches hidden after this check time.

		I am not sure whether this is a regression or was like that all the time??! 2013.08.17-NB Steps: Search for a GC-code which is already stored on your device but use lower case characters Result: Cache is downloaded from network instead directly opened from list Status &quot;Saved for offline&quot; is correctly shown, but however the network call is unnecessary I think the search entry should just be converted to uppercase.

		Since todays nightly build 2013-08-18 I noticed this bug (but may be older): Not every cache for which I stored an offline-log is getting this red mark in lists. It is especially easy to see, when I open the history. Most entrys that are from yesterday or older don't have that marking. But after open one caches details and go back that cache get the mark.

		Hello, I am french and new on this forum that's why, please understand my situation if i don't use good rules of here. With my girlfriend, we use c:geo to geocaching and we are very happy to use this application to find cache. During 6 months we use this application with Samsung Galaxy Note II, but we use a Wiko cink five adn we have problem with fonction of nearby and compass. Every second, distance change from good distance and different distance very far from the right distance. When we use navigation and other application from gps postitioning that's ok. That's why i would like to know i have to change setting on my phone or c geo application? Thanks for answers.

		From support mail: When importing the attached gpx file to c:geo (latest version from Android store) only 12 caches are imported. No other program (Locus on Android, EasyGPS on Windows) or Garmin device does have problems with that gpx file. File: http://db.tt/fKMDjy1h The file looks a little strange (e.g. the geocodes in it) But if it is syntactically OK we should be able to import it. BTW: There is also the NaN problem in the import progress dialoge here.

		WIth 2013.08.21-NB I experienced this. It is hard to describe, therefore I attached screenshots (First is the map with caches as it was presented, second is the list of the caches (Menu -&gt; Show as list)). It is also difficult to describe how that happend. I have been in the very same map area yesterday with the live map active. So most probably the caches have already been cached. Today I returned there and opened the live map again....this is what I got. The map is in strategy detailed. Due to the fact, that there are unknown cache types without orange circle my assumption is that merging of nearby result with map data is confused somehow.

		Caches which ones got an offline-log that were cleared afterwards remain in the history. In my eyes that is not helpful but a bit irritating. The caches will (correctly) not exported in field-notes but of course counted in the sum of history records. You get a wrong number of caches when you like to know the sum of founds since your last history export/reset. Im am not shure if its related with related to #3081 or a complety different issue.

		I've recently switched c:geo to use offline maps, in preparation for a trip to Italy. In the UK, the offline maps are separate for England, Wales, Scotland etc. When I move from one region to another, I have to manually go into the settings and select the right map, it would be nice if this was picked according to location. For bonus point: revert back to &quot;live&quot; map when no offline one is present (especially when browsing the map) - for instance, I'm set to England right now as I'm at home, but I was scrolling around the live map looking for caches in Italy... but no map appears, making it hard.

		Feature request: I am using c:geo with different Pocket Querys. From time to time it is necessary to replace the hole PQ. There is no other easy way to keep all data up to date. (updating the caches whould not bring new caches in the area and not delete archived caches. And additionaly needs needs much time, data-plan-usage and gc-server-capacity). Like much users I have a list for each PQ. So I have to delete all caches in the list and import a newer PQ for that area. But all self-created waypoints etc. get lost in that moment. I whould like a possibillity to keep all that kind of data. I know it whould waste much phone-storage-place to keep every waypoint of deleted caches from holidays years before. Thats not the best way. But perhaps its possible to delete the data some time later after thethe cachelisting and only if there is not the same cache stored on the phone again in the meantime?? Or a complete different posibillity to replace a PQ?

		From support mail: I am running c:geo version 2013.08.24 and have Light Skin selected. When I go into Settings, the main screen is displayed correctly. When I select any sub-option, the text is not visible. I have to slide finger up or down (scroll) and then text will appear. Running on HTC Incredible Phone. For me on Android 4.x it is working normal. But HTC Incredible for sure has some Android 2.x version which I am unable to test. Maybe someone can have a look on the emulator. AFAIR we already had some version specific problems with the light skin in the past.

		I'm using last nightly build 2013.08.25 When I'm in cache list, press menu and then export, the progress bar is counting caches, not field notes. So even I'm uploading one &quot;Found&quot; log, there is a number something like 286/286 (the number is exactly number of caches in the list). I think that there should be counter of number of field notes for upload.

		Some users on FB thought, that c:geo recognizes them as basic members. After asking what makes them think so, it turned out that they did not get the meaning of the menu item &quot;Basic member&quot; which was shown to them. The fact that it is greyed out was interpreted as this field is for information only (showing that the user is basic member). This item should be renamed to e.g. &quot;Basic Member options&quot; or have a subtitle &quot;This item is only needed for basic members&quot;.

		An noticeable amount of people on FB and support mail are mentioning that the nearby search gives them additional results which are several 1000km away. First feedback (and my personal assumption) shows that for these users one of the opencaching platforms seems to be activatad, although they claim that they did not do it manually (just upgraded the app). Can someone check if the initial values for that platforms are set to disabled?

		In the newest nightly-builds I noticed that the same cache-popup on the livemap sometimes opens a few times. Sometimes it needs a second or two until that popup is open. When I touch on the cache icon again and again in that time (because I don't know if the device had realised my touch) the popup opens again after I touched the dark map to to close it. So in some cases I have to touch the map three or four times to go back to the map.

		When I use the live-map-feature to search online for caches I often have to load that caches a few times and spend the data-usage a few times. Thats because almoust every time I switch to an other app and back (and every time I leave the livemap to open an other cache in history and reopen livemap again than) that caches are gone from the map. Even when I already opened a cache-detail-page and downloaded (not stored) all cache-details the cache will not not shown on the map after an app-switch. The &quot;unstored&quot; cachedate is kept three days by c:geo. why can't the cache-icon also be displayed all that three days?

		Sometimes not all stored caches will be shown on the map. I noticed this much times when I zoom out from a center of an imported PQ with 500 or more caches. The round circle full of caches seem to be cutted at the half and the eastern part is missing. If the shape of imported PQ is round that is easy to recognize but if it is rectangular (for example from gsak) that can be really irritating. If its really not possible to display all caches I whould like to get a short error-message.

		The Text of Street-, Building-, and Area-Names is displayed very small on high-res-devices. In the moment I help myself with zoom in and try to read the text in that second until the more detailed map picture is shown (with small text again). In that second the text have a nice-to-read-sice. I have no very bad eyes so I think we need a &quot;bigger&quot; map-scale for high-res-displays.

		Hope this is not a duplicate, - i found nothing in the old issues. I created a PQ named &quot;Rügen Auswahl&quot; at gc.com and marked the option &quot; Include Pocket Query name in download file name&quot; there. But I was not able to import it to c:geo. I get the Error Message &quot;Bad bite at 10&quot;. It worked with two workarounds: open the zip and rename the gpx-files so that the umlauts are gone create a PQ without this name-option. Here the not-working file: http://db.tt/WUkVQ9Hu

		As the discussion in #3212 showed, there may be problems the way we do multiple requests automatically in the Network class. I assume, that spurious reports of multiple logs or images posted (see e.g. #2921) may come from this as well. So the question is, if we remove this altogether or limit it only to specific use cases or only remove it for OAuth calls. Opinions, comments, questions welcome.

		IRC-discussion with Lineflyer: (22:30:41) Lineflyer: another last question
(22:30:53) Lineflyer: live map seems to have lost performance in the last months.
(22:31:12) rsudev: You mean gc.com live map?
(22:31:13) Lineflyer: I am not sure if this is just gc.com (after their tile server change)
(22:31:16) Lineflyer: c:geo
(22:31:29) rsudev: gc.com in c:geo?
(22:31:33) Lineflyer: yes
(22:31:58) Lineflyer: Now something really weired out of my mind
(22:32:29) Lineflyer: In the logs is see &quot;Cache XY loaded from DB&quot; or &quot;Cache xy returned no results&quot; for each and every cache parsed from live map
(22:32:59) Lineflyer: I am really not sure if this was the procedure ever since or came in new
(22:33:09) Lineflyer: COuld this slow done the whole process?
(22:33:31) Lineflyer: I see some 0,2-0,5 seconds or sometimes even more between those consecutive requests
(22:33:55) Lineflyer: Are these DB requests?
(22:34:04) Lineflyer: DB is slow,...isnt it?
(22:34:04) rsudev: These are DB requests
(22:34:10) rsudev: they are slow
(22:34:29) rsudev: We need them to get coords and found state of stored caches (and type and...)
(22:34:40) Lineflyer: Was it always like that? Or maybe due to changes in merging data?
(22:34:50) rsudev: they could be fater if bundled
(22:35:02) Lineflyer: fater :D
(22:35:05) Lineflyer: ;)
(22:35:07) rsudev: That I am not sure of - I copuld try to research this
(22:35:16) rsudev: fater faster :)
(22:35:55) Lineflyer: cachecache = DB  Right?
(22:36:00) rsudev: no
(22:36:15) rsudev: cachecache helps avoiding db
(22:36:46) Lineflyer: isnt cachecache just for unsaved caches
(22:37:40) Lineflyer: saved with listid=0
(22:37:47) Lineflyer: in DB
(22:37:48) Lineflyer: ?
(22:38:14) rsudev: No. Its for all. Its the only place where we hold livemap caches, but all detailed ones are in the db and in the cachecache if needed
(22:38:25) Lineflyer: mmh
(22:39:24) Lineflyer: couldnt we load all saved caches to cachecache when starting cgeo or livemap ?  (Again: Just brainstorming wiithout any deep knowledge)
(22:40:03) Lineflyer: Sadly the c:geo version of just after introduction of cachecache is no longer working
(22:40:20) Lineflyer: I remember an impressive performance boost  at that time
(22:40:34) rsudev: We can't generally, as even the big phones do not have enough memory for that
(22:40:40) Lineflyer: ok
(22:41:45) Lineflyer: I would really love to have a flow chart of how that live map merging works to analyze and improve...but this will not be easy
(22:41:46) rsudev: We can try to bulk load caches in the live-map area (we do that anyway, hmmm)
(22:42:13) rsudev: Perhaps these additional requests are just not needed
(22:42:58) Lineflyer: As said...It is just my brain telling me that those hundreds of &quot;Cache xy retuned no results&quot; was not present in the past (months ago)
(22:44:13) rsudev: those should be relatively fast, I assume
(22:44:51) Lineflyer: not really...afair...  some weeks ago I posted this somewhere that I see a maximum of 2-3 lines per second in the log

		Always returning the twenty first results from opencaching seems to be not a good idea, as you may be far off the mainland of a particular site and thus receive a number of meaningless results (several thousand kilometers away). One option can be to manually switch this site off (which would lead to some missed caches as the occasional cache is placed her and there even far off the mainland. I suggest to introduce a maximum range instead of about 100 or 200 km.

		Digging through ImageSelectActivity code I found out that the preview image is always downsampled by 8 instead of calculating the necessary downsampling rate. There is still code in ImageUtils to calculate the downsampling rate. That should be separated to calculateDownsample and scale and ImageSelectActivity should use it only providing the desired preview boundings.

		As found out by @rsudev it there are retries on post requests in class Network. This will lead to several posted images on timeout of 30 seconds. POST requests should not be retried in Network but maybe by the caller. If we need to retry here, we should split up in two post methods: post and repeatedPost. Another approach is to set Network timeout to a higher value in GCParser.imageUpload. Any feedback?

		This was already mentioned in #417. A lot of request are on support email and facebook to implement talking list in addition to talking compass. Talking list would give you spoken instructions to the next cache. Like for power trails for example. The question just remains what is the next cache. Caches that are &quot;in front of you&quot; (9 o'clock - 3 o'clock) Caches that are not found (and do not have stored log) Only caches that have a strage there (would it make sense to talk for misteries?) Shall it work only on stored lists or also on nearby, etc... I have also selected feedback to get feedback.

		If a trackable is in the hands of a cacher then the TB page says &quot;In the hands of XXX&quot;. This text is clickable and should open a menu where &quot;XXX&quot; is used as data. Right now the data is &quot;In the hands of XXX&quot; that will lead to opening invalid links in browser or trying to view invalid data. The problem is that UserActionsClickListener.java is using the full text of the view as data...

		From support mail (did not have time to verify this yet): I think there is some problem with cache attributes (considering opencaching.pl). Before August update I could see the attributes (not sure if all) in text form just below cache description. Now, in new version only few attributes are displayed as icons (changing into text after touching) below cache main details screen. Most of attributes are skipped. Why?

		From support mail: Go to cache details, navigate, download static maps.  Go back into navigate and the option to download static maps is still there.  BUT.... go back out to the list view, reselect the same cache and now go into navigate - this time it recognises the maps have been downloaded and ready to use.

		I downloaded a zipped .kmz (for Google Earth) file to my phone with my browser. Attempting to open it automatically opens c:geo, and I can't change this by clearing a default app in Android, because it doesn't seem to be registered that way. To attempt to open the file in anything else, I had to uninstall c:geo.

		I just tested the circles feature. To be of any value to owners it should draw circles only around physical stages of a cache. That is a) the coordinates of a traditional cache b) the physical stages of a multi-cache (where a box is hidden to give further clues) c) the final coordinates of a multi-cache (if available) d) the final coordinates of a mystery (if available) I checked the current stable version (2013.08.26) and also the nightly build (2013.09.06-NB-e21a54e) and in both circles are drawn around multi-cache header coordinates and mysteries. That is a bug and should be corrected.

		Is there a possibility that the cache icons on the maps could match that of geocaching.com. The current icons are superb, what I mean is the one for traditionals that are for premium users are round and the one's for all members (basic and premium) are square. Currently all cache icons are all shown as circles.

		When browsing the Live Map, after panning around, sometimes tapping on a cache will open details for a totally different cache (possibly that was visible in previous area viewed). Going back to the map and tapping the cache again will open the correct info.

		One can refresh all caches in the history list. Doing that will lead to asking for a list to store all these caches. That's unusable. It should be possible to refresh those caches and leave them on their own list each.

		From support mail: I'm using the c:geo App already a while whit a custom map theme. Now I tried to change the theme and selected the directory of the new theme. But it still reads the old one. I already tried to rename the old theme and select the renamed theme but then it says that the theme could not be found. As workaround I placed the new theme at the same location as the old one. So the conclusion is, that the selected theme was saved on a different location/key with the old GUI and the renderer reads the theme from this old location/key and not the new one.

		When more than one cache is removed since we opened a non-default list view, we should propose to remove the list as well. We do it the other way around (propose to remove the caches when we remove the list) but some users might just remove all the caches, expecting to be able to remove the list at the same time.

		I found issue with opencaching.pl cache images. C:GEO only download spoiler image, but not download other cache images. You can try this bug in cache OP4FE1 (http://opencaching.pl/viewcache.php?cacheid=20454). Other - on opencaching.pl there are some other attributes than in gc.com, so maybe you can add this attributes (http://wiki.opencaching.pl/index.php/Parametry_skrzynki).

		When I open a cache-detail-page on my devices (latest stable or nightly builds) and than &gt;menu&gt;navigate&gt;map I get the map with this one cache and its waypoints only. (I think that is right and useful) Last week I tried the same on a samsung galaxy S4 (last stable build from playstore) and the result was the normal map with all other caches also displayed. I don't know a setting to change that so I think it must be a bug!?

		My device and my c:geo are usually in French. I do not have the &quot;Translate to English&quot; menu because it is only offered when c:geo is configured to use English. Given the fact that the most used translator, Google Translate, uses English as a pivot language and may be very bad for other languages, I propose to always offer the &quot;Translate to English&quot; menu in addition to the local language. This has hit me in Prague where the French translation for some cache was awful.

             }
             return getQuantityString(farId, quantity, String.valueOf(quantity)); in TextFactory.java when the plurals already handle the special one quantity?

		I use „Radar“ (GPS Status 4.3.78) when approaching a cache. I notice the coordinates sent to that app are off by .001 in lon or lat direction for many caches. Examples: GC423BT, listed at N50° 47,654 and E 006° 04,212. When switching to Radar, target coordinates are N50° 47.654 (OK), but E 006° 04.211! Same for GC34TXF (N 50° 48,247 E 006° 04,622) targeted in Radar as N 50° 48.246, E 006° 4.622. I only noticed it in lon or lat component, never in both at the same time. Some caches are OK, like GC4DCZH. Build-in &quot;Kompass&quot; is OK, so i guess it has to do with sending the coordinates to GPS Status app, While the difference is small, in urban settings it can be crucial, and i start to reason about why i did not find so many caches during the last weeks. I did not notice that difference…

		When using GC.com and OC.de in parallel, the icons for caches published on both pages perfectly align. The OC.de-cache icon gets painted on top. When tapping on the map, i can only open the details for the OC cache, not the GC one, because it is covered by the other icon. More often than not, i would like to see the details of the GC.com listing, as they are often more up-to-date (archivings, deactivations), or their logs contains better info (DNFs, better/more hints). I would like to ask for a selection dialog when two icons are too near too each other so that i can choose whether i get to see the details of the GC or OC listing. Or detect there are two listings on different services for the same coordinate, and allow for switching the listing in the detail view.

		Filtering for Whereigo or Letterbox (did not try all the other „exotic“ cache types) shows me all OC caches mixed with the correctly filtered GC caches in &quot;nearby&quot; search. As OC does not support these cache types, i propose the OC caches should default to NOT match these filters. Now they seem to default to match the filter &quot;just in case&quot;, or erronously.

		During the recent presentations I gave and also during events I notice that nearly no one knows about the Pocket Query Creator app, although it is listed in our helpers apps screen. I was wondering if we could increase the visibility by having a new menu item besides the import GPX file and import from web menu items, which would always be visible and would either invoke the pocket query creator or redirect to the market page (if not installed yet). Comments? Other ideas?

			<description>
		Hi! I tried playing around with custom map styles, but failed miserably. Now i cannot get rid of it. Copied a dir structure with 3 map styles to device Set map themes dir to root of that structure went to live map, in settings, map settings, select map theme i selected one of the (correctly displayed) themes c:geo died unexpectedly (perhaps a bug on itself, but well…) restarted c:geo, went to live map, c:geo dies again Cannot undo my theme selection, as i cannot get to the settings of the live map anymore I delete the dir with the 3 map styles I go to live map again, get toast &quot;map theme not found&quot;. I go to settings and select &quot;standard&quot; map theme. When going to live map, i continue to get &quot;map theme not found'. Displayed map theme is &quot;standard&quot; as selected. I want to &quot;delete&quot; the selected directory for map themes in general settings, but that is not possible. I can only select a dir, but cannot &quot;empty&quot; the selection I go all the way up in my dir tree on the device. Upmost dir i can select is &quot;/sdcard&quot;. I select this one. When again i want to change the selection, in the dir selection dialog there are no sub dirs diplayed, &quot;path&quot; at the top shows &quot;/&quot; Now i am stuck: I cannot change map themes dir, i cannot reset it to &quot;nothing&quot;, when starting map i get &quot;map theme not found&quot; although i selected &quot;standard&quot;. I propose to give the user an easy way to reset his map theme settings to „factory&quot; when things get borked. Is there any way for me to do this manually? I can edit files on my device if necessard. Using 2013.09.16-RC.

		On the last two events I have been, both times I have seen a person using c:geo with our upgrade warning on the main screen and that person wondering why something did not work, but not having the idea that an upgrade is available or needed. I have the feeling that our message text or the general presentation of that warning are not explicit enough. We should change the text to &quot;Hey dude. Install the new version, this one is broken&quot; or have the warning shown as confirmation dialog after some time. Any other suggestions how to improve this?

		After negotiating with an user who reported that c:geo keeps showing 0 caches at the status bar in c:geo for him, I adviced :) to find another cache. So now the user has two finds and c:geo shows them normally. Prior to that the user tried resinstalling,etc,etc. with the same result that 0 caches are shown. So I guess there is really a problem recognizing a find count of 1.

		The map settings are only accessible when the map is displayed. This leads to an vicious circle when due to misconfiguration c:geo crashes when displaying the map: The faulty setting cannot be reset, as the menu cannot be reached before the crash.

		I can currently not provide a step-by-step for this but its quite obvious: 2013.09.20-NB Filter for a special cache type (global filter) Open live map Zoom or pan around (I guess zooming out below where gc.com hides them for PM) Some caches of other types (parsed from map, orange circled) appear and stay (also when zooming in again) Solution would be limiting the minimum zoom-level in which tiles are requested (as discussed in another issue) or refiltering after parsing (I guess this is currently only done for BM).

		After the latest update, 2 days ago, I am unable to access the Android c:geo app at all. It even crashes the Google Play app instantly, when I try to reach and open c:geo that way. I am reluctant to try to uninstall and reinstall, after I read that it will erase every saved cache, and note, and so on. Am I the only one experiencing this problem? What to do, please?

		Our OAuth signing is wrong for the reserved characters of RFC 3986. OAuth requires everything except unreserved characters to be encoded: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#encoding_parameters I found this while trying to add support for name search in OKAPI and failed for a long time, due to us not encoding the asterisk wildcard &quot;*&quot;. Even if our OAuth signing method is only 20 lines, to me this issue (and the hours I spent looking back and forth) makes me think it should be replaced by a ready-made library.

		When viewing a map, one of the options is to show the visible caches as a list, however it is only active when 'enable live' is also activated AND the live feed has finished loading for the map view. As someone who predominantly uses c:geo in an offline mode, is it possible to have this feature active without the live feed? thanks.

		I just made a longer multi cache and used the note taking field below the listing to keep track of the variables i took along the route. It read like A=1
B=2
C=3
 Suddenly when looking again at the list later, it read A=1
B=2
C=3
--
A=1
B=2
C=3
 The content has been doubled, separated by &quot;--&quot;. I could continue editing the (doubled) content without problems, and nothing strange happened any more. I am very, very sure i did not copy the content or type the &quot;--&quot; by myself. Is this a bug or some obscure type of feature i accidently triggered? I cannot reproduce the cause, but perhaps someone can have a look if something inside the note taking field looks fishy or if there is some reference to the string &quot;--&quot; somewhere.

		With NB 2013.10.03 I experienced several crashes in different parts of the app which didnot stop until I deactivated oc.de. NB 2013.10.02 was quite stable. So my assumption (which is totally unvalidated due to lack of logging capability) would be that something with the oc.de interface is broken from yesterday to today. A focus area of the crashes are in the search field when searching for cache name or GC-code. Reproducible for me was: Search for &quot;GC4&quot; Progress window is shown but before cache is displayed c:geo crashes Note: OC.de was activated in parallel to gc.com to that time I am outside the OC.de area (&gt;200km rule applies) Edit: changed title according to description from @AlfredSK

		In the folder /sdcard./cgeo are all the caches that were ever loaded by the app. At least that's my understanding. It would be great if there would be a differentiation between saved caches (from lists) and all temporary loaded caches. I would appreciate it if there would be a function to delete all caches but the ones saved on my lists.

		All caches nearby are loaded and only after I clicked the map icon of the cache to see the details they become grayed out and eventually hidden. The same goes sometimes for found caches, I have to open them completely, then when I go back to the live map, I see the cache with a smiley and only if I change the zoom level the found cache disappears. It would be an improvement to load the status of the cache on the livemap so that deactivated caches aren't shown at first.

		The new customizable templates for twitter posts allows insertion of placeholders. But these placeholders do not include the name of the found cache / touched trackable and the coord.info URL. I would consider these the most useful information for twitter postings (and it was also included in the default text before).

		When deactivating „hide deactivated caches“ (so showing them), archived OC-caches are displayed, but not OC caches with status „gesperrt“. Example is OCDB3D. It never shows in the live map, whether „hide deactivated caches“ is activated or not. I propose handling „gesperrt“ and „archiviert“ alike. Version: 2013-10-07-NB

		2013.10.06-NB: Set global filter by cache type Open a (non default list) Select Menu -&gt; Manage -&gt; Delete all and list Result: Filtered cache type caches are deleted List is deleted Non filter matching caches are moved to default list I am not sure how this function should react in such a case... However just pushing all remaining caches to the default list confuses my list management and was not what I expected. I suggest to either ignore the filter in that case and really delete all caches of that list or not offer the &quot;Delete all and list&quot; in this (filtered) case.

		I propose to make a more sensible default for the type of a waypoint when creating a new one, depending on the type of cache: Traditional: Keep Reference point Mystery: Make „Final“ default Multi: Make „Stage of Multi“ default (or whatever the english translation is in the moment) — yes i know that then at the end you have to change to „Final“. But normally Multis have more than one stage, but only one final. Others: Don't know, perhaps you guys have ideas? Else keep „Reference Point“. I personally never need a „reference point“, and so i have to constantly change the type of waypoint when i need one. Just a small thing, but it would mean less annoyance. Thanks for considering.

		Often, i take a nice picture before approaching and finding the cache, that i want to add to the cache log. When selecting a picture now you only can select between taking one right now or going to the gallery where in 99% of cases i select the last picture i took, not one from 3 months ago, that it would allow me to do…In one app i once saw an option „Last picture taken“, that automatically took the newest picture from the gallery with just one click. Perhaps this can be implemented in addition to the other two options? I suspect c:geo has to scan the DCIM-directory itself and cannot rely on delegating the task to the gallery app for that feature. Or is there an matching intent? Bonuspoints when it takes the second-to-last picture when i already uploaded the last one (when i want to upload two pictures to the same log). Thanks for considering.

		From support mail: c:geo used to remember the position to which I scrolled on each tab of the cache details. Now this is still working except for the log tab. I tested this with the result: Open cache details Change to logbook screen Scroll down some log entries (and keep it in mind) Change to description screen Chane back to logbook screen Result: Position is still the same Now change to e.g. to details screen (more than one slide away from logbook!) Change back to logbook screen Result: The logbook position has been resetted and is opened at the top

		Most likely related with #3354 When scrolling down in the cache listing, then swiping to WP tabs and creating a new one and saving it, or editing an existing one and saving it or navigating or„radaring“ to it and returning, the scroll position in the cache listing resets to the top. Most annoying when doing Multis where you have to cope with many waypoints but also need the listing to solve the stages. IMHO, scroll position on listing page should be preserved all the time until i leave the cache details.

		When trying to scroll down in a cache listing and i pull the finger down just a little bit diagonally, the cache listing would not scroll, but the swipe left/right animation starts, but „bounces“ back to the cache listing, as the horizontal swipe is not enough, Sometimes i need 3-5 attempts to scroll down in the cache listing, especially when doing a „kinetic“ scroll, flipping the finger down and lifting it from the display. I do not see that behaviour that sensitive in other app. Is the sensitivity of detecting the horizontal part of the swipe configurable? If so, i suggest making it a little less senitive. I also would not mind when the horizontal part of the movement would start the swipe left/right animation and bounce back as long as the vertical part would still lead to scrolling the cache listing. But the vertical part gets discarded and it would not scroll. Again, i speak of very small deviations from being vertical, not 45 degree angles. Using 2013.10.14-NB-fff9cde

		When swiping right from Cache Details to Listing, when i quickly start scrolling down in the Listing after the swipe animation ended optically, the scroll does not happen, but the horizontal parts of the scroll gesture trigger anothor swipe left/right animation that bounces back. When waiting a split second an the newly swiped to page before starting scrolling down all works as expected. So: Swipe right to Listing, start scrolling: No scroll, another swipe left/right with horizontal part of the scroll gesture is initiated. This persists as long as i try scrolling. After a short break of scroll-attempts of about 0.5sec scrolling works as expected. When doing Swipe right-short break-scroll it works. I can reproduce it 90% of the time on Cache Listing and Log page when swiping to them from one of the neighbouring pages. When reading the listing from the top one would not notice because you do not start a scroll immediately. But when going from WP page of a Multi to the log page, often you immediately want to scroll down to get to a stage description down the page. Then this behaviour is more obvious, and you are forced to make an artificial break before scrolling down, something that feels very unresponsive and annoys me :-). Is it possible that the swipe left/right animation has some kind of cooldown after it optically ended that prevents an successful immediate scroll gesture? I hope my observation can be reproduced, else i would have to do a video :-)

		Today I had the time to browser through a lot of issues, did some cleanup of duplicates and wanted to get an impression about bugs and their perceived severity. Having done this together with the user feedback from support mail, FB and my own experience I want to share my impression on the current release and yet start a new &quot;Next release&quot; discussion. First of all: The current release seems to be clean of high severity and only has some medium and low severity issues (as mentioned further down). In fact, there are almost no complaints on FB or support mail which is a really good thing. You/We did a real good job with the last release!! However some single issues need a correction as soon as possible as they are not affecting all users but are severe at least to the affected users: #2976 Affects only offline map users in combination with some devices. But for those users the feature becomes unusable. There are some side issues (all created by the new settings scheme) which can be implicitly solved by solving this. #3329 We did not take into consideration that personal note is a premium feature. All BM users doing the upload are affected by this issue. #2108 There seeem to be some devices where the compass is either consistently or sporadically not working, which has a high functional impact. A possible way forward was mentioned in this issue. #3267 Users which use OC and have their time not set correctly will not be able to use OC. Secondly in my opinion these regressions or uncatched problems in new features need a correction: #3325 While implementing personal note upload we forgot the limit of 4000 chars. #2168 The OSM maps are getting unusable for more and more users (more high-res displays in the field) due to our memory problem there. #3088 There are still reports (and it somehow matches my experience) that the livemap got slower with one of the last releases. Comments and suggestions and other opinions are welcome. I hope this gives a little overview about issues and where we are right now.

		Although we now have a customizable text, the default hashtags (#cgeo #geoaching) are still silently appended at the end. Users might instead want to use own hashtags, thus they should be part of the default text instead of being fixed. Additionally this unnecessarily shortens the maximum possible length of the tweet. Remark: Touching TB tweet does not append the default hashtags, but the cache found tweet does.

		Due to the recent gc.com site update on October, 16th parsing spoiler images seems to have a problem: The unit test fails and @rsudev debugged it back to GC2JVEH failing to parse the spoiler images. Also for me in the NB neither the spoiler hint nor the gallery is shown for this cache. We decided not to push a notification as we assume it should be solvable quite easy and we could release a bugfix.

		It seems gcvote had some problems the last days. Many user contacted us, reporting that cache opening got stuck at &quot;Loading GCVote&quot; phase for several minutes. We should avoid waiting such a long time on a non responding server. Recently there was a change in the network retries. Is this issue already solved implicitly with that?

		Right now, the GCVote settings only contain a password input setting. And in the cache details settings we have another option whether to download votes or not. I'd rather move that checkbox into the GCVote section to globally enable and disable the use of GCVote (for download as well as voting yourself), similarly to the other services. That's more aligned with the other settings and makes it more easy to find, probably.

		From support mail: When looking at a list of saved caches I can not see whether some have stored notes.

		From support mail: When caching n a high-dense area it is sometimes hard to see the map as it is cluttered with caches. It would be very helpful to have a toggle-switch to hide/unhide caches on the map in the map menu. Could indeed be helpful but if this is implemented it should always fall back to &quot;Show caches&quot; if the map is reopened. Otherwise users might miss to switch it back on and report a problem.

		When listing the PQs in c:geo the number shown behind the name of the PQ seems to be the maximum possible entries of this PQ as listed on http://www.geocaching.com/pocket/ in the tab &quot;Active Pocket Queries&quot;. This is no meaningful information as the real amount of caches in that PQ might be different. The real amount of caches contained is only listed on the website tab &quot;Pocket Queries ready for Download&quot; on the same URL. Unfortunately not all active PQs are also available in the other tab. So my suggestion would just be to remove the number in the PQ selection in c:geo.

		As far as I am aware of the information needed to get this percentage, we need the total amount of logs for a cache. We do only have this information if a cache is detailed and/or saved. As a result of a search may also contain (typically) not stored cache the sorting will not result in any useful order, thus this option should only be present on offline lists.

		Helo, I have exported a set of caches to the GPX file, transported the file to another device and imported it to the c:geo again on the second device. But the caches does not contain the rating, popularity, inventory (TB) info etc. on the second device.

		When exporting cache GC32996 or GC2N3YV to the GPX, c:geo display message &quot;export failed&quot;. Actualy there is second issue with this. When exporting a lot of caches and c:geo display short message &quot;export failed&quot; somewhere in the middle. So it is not easy to find which cache caused the failure. It would be usefull to display also code or name of the cache in the message.

		Currently when refreshing a saved cache we also download and store the personal note from the website. If a local note is also present a correct merging is done. But if only a local note is present but no note on server we won't upload the note. Would it make sense to include this in the refresh procedure or would this essentially slow down the refreshing? Background is, that a user contacted us saying that he has 400 caches in c:geo with local personal notes in it (created before we introduced the upload mechanism). Now he asks about an easy way to sync these local notes with the website.

		I originally wrote a comment on commit ddaa662 which introduced a strikethrough of the cache title for past events. As no one answered I would like to get your feedback here instead: I am not sure if this might be misinterpreted by users. Up to now strikethrough is only used for disabled caches and I personally think we should not change this. As I like the idea in principle I suggest to find another method of marking a past event. How about a strikethrough of the event date only?

I don't know if elsewhere. If you can try I would like to know if I'm alone facing this issue or not.

			<description>
		Just started to use offline maps and found the following bug: if i go in cgeo to stored -&gt; klick on the map icon on the top right -&gt; select any preloaded cache and click -&gt; more details -&gt; now i click on the compas icon on the top right which should open the map instead of compass (thats my setting) -&gt; now it opens the map with all stored caches again, instead of just the one i selected. the same thing is also for waypoints if i first open the map to show all stored caches and after that i open one of this caches go to waypoints and click on one and select map. it will show me the map again with all stored caches instead of just the waypoint.. this bug also happens if i do the same as above but now i am clicking at the map in cache details instead of the compass symbol. it also opens the map with all stored caches instead of just the selected one. but if i go to stored-&gt;select any cache-&gt;click on compass or the small map in cache details it will work right. its just if i opened the map before with all stored caches. then it wont work... would be nice if you could fix it soon :)

		Hi i have two problems (sorry for my english). First: On active map instead of type of cache is displayed two question marks (?? - unknown type) until i open cache details. Saved caches are displayed corectly Second: Visited caches are displayed like unvisited even if filter is active. On the begining of using this app everything was OK it started about week ago.

		Today I noticed that the userdefined description text which is shown for each waypoint in the WP tab gets mixed up when scrolling through the list of waypoints. I can not exactly give a clue on when this happens, but if a cache has e.g. 12 waypoints where the first one has the description &quot;This is a small parking spot&quot; and you scroll down and up the list a few times suddenly some of the other waypoints also show the description &quot;This is a small parking spot&quot; in the overview. Such a like this happens with all WP texts randomly. If you open those wrong described waypoints the wrong description is not shown, which probably means it is only a problem in the WP overview view. 2013.11.09-NB

		We used to have this problem some time ago, but it seems that happens again: I had 6 pair of coords in the personal note and 6 WPs created from them. I edited the personal note in c:geo and added a 7th pair of coords Saved the note and uploaded it I refreshed the cache to get the new coords parsed to a new waypoint Result: It ended up in having 10 &quot;personal note&quot; WPs, i.e. some are doubled The note looks like this: Station 1: N 51 20.123 E 006 58.123 Station 2: .... ... (I added Station 7)

		Hopefully I am clear enough with this request. There are trackable tags out there that have a QR printed on them. Some examples: http://shop.geocaching.com/default/trackable-items/travel-bugs/new-geocaching-qr-travel-bugr-black.html http://shop.geocaching.com/default/trackable-items/qr-tech-tags/qr-tech-tag.html The QR contains the url of the trackable page including the tracking code. Currently you can already scan these with any barcode scanning app and be taken to the trackable page within c:geo. What I am requesting though is to be able to scan these with the &quot;Geocode&quot; scanner that is already included within c:geo and be taken to the trackable page without ever having to leave the app. Currently the geocode scanner only supports cache pages using the userscript here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95134 I will also contact the author of the userscript to see if he can add QR to trackable pages also.

		When approaching a cache you usually use the map at first and then filp over to compass or radar when you are close to GZ. However you might frequently flip between them at GZ to account for the local topology (tracks, water, street sides, etc.). This should be achievable for the c:geo internally provided navigations such as map and compass (e.g. by an explicit separate button at the top or by an implict click area as I proposed it in PR #3427) but for externally provided navigations I have no approach in mind.

		When i want to see a WP or a cache location on a map, and i select &quot;Navigation&quot; from the context menu of the WP or the menu in the cache details, it asks me whether i want it in opened in Locus, although Locus is the only option i configured for the navigation menu in the settings. It is completely unnecessary to ask for the option when only one is enabled. I guess that is just a harmless small code change like &quot;if number of options == 1 then skip select dialog&quot;.

		I changed my formerly broken map theme path to some &quot;innocent&quot; directory where no single XML file resides (unfortunately there seems to be no way to &quot;delete&quot; the map theme directory path). When i go to the live map and i select the map theme from the menu, it only offers &quot;standard&quot; (perhaps &quot;default&quot; in english)? It is selected and i also tapped it again just to be sure. But still when using the live map i get a short toast saying that the map theme is not found. There seems to be some residual „garbage“ that screws up the map theme thing although i want to go back to the default. Version 2013.11.12-NB

		After you have logged a find, it gets saved in the history and gets removed from the live maps. If you want to check a friends log, you enter the history and press refresh but if you do this it resets the time you originally logged to 00.00 everytime. Can this be fixed please. Regard Matt

		Garmin devices have the option of downloading spoiler images. http://garminoregon6xx.wikispaces.com/Geocaching+With+Photos These images can be batch fetched with tools like GSAK, or manually added/downloaded from coordinate checkers. They are stored as: Photos: [GPSr]\Garmin\GeocachePhotos\Last Character\Second To Last Character\Full Code\ Spoiler Photos: [GPSr]\Garmin\GeocachePhotos\Last Character\Second To Last Character\Full Code\Spoilers\ Example: Images for geocache OXZTXGC would be placed as shown: Photos: [GPSr]\Garmin\GeocachePhotos\C\G\OXZTXGC\ Spoiler Photos: [GPSr]\Garmin\GeocachePhotos\C\G\OXZTXGC\Spoilers\ c:geo should be able to import or display these spoiler images (eg. option to select directory), so that an user can manually add addition spoiler images to the cache page which are not included on the webpage.

		When I clicked on &quot;nearby&quot; to see nearby caches, there is no way to filter only caches I didn't find. I see that I can filter to have pretty much everything else. I can use the map and I can see the caches with and without smiles, and I can pick from there, but it would be nice to have the the list filtered to &quot;didn't find&quot; only.

		In slovak translation, there´s an attribute: &quot;dogs allowed&quot;. In slovak language it is translated as &quot;psi povolené&quot; and that should be &quot;psy povolené&quot;. Also I would like to mark my own caches as found so I can easily sort them on my phone, because I don´t normally find my own caches. It could be as a setting. Thanks, c:geo is a great app!

		Working with waypoints is more awkward than it should be. I propose the following changes to make the experience 'smoother': Remove the save button from edit waypoint, add save and cancel to 'action bar', make 'save' the default action on 'back' Swap short and long press in waypoint list. Short-press - edit, long-press - menu

		The issue is that when I download certain number of caches (say 40 nearby caches) and I minimise the app, say just for a phonecall, and than I bring c:geo back, in many ocations the caches will be gone and I have to download the list again. It does not matter if I just got them in the list or opened them in a map. The only caches which will remain are those which I have allready opened (not downloaded for offline, just opened). It does not happen regularly, but still quite often and it can be especially anoying in places with weak network coverage. It happened to my on my HD2 running 2.3.7 and it happens on my SIII, no matter if on stock 4.0.1 - 4.1.2 or custom 4.2.2 - 4.3.1. Related to this issue, it would be very helpfull to add list saving ability like the one built in GCZII. I really would like to be able to save lists of caches when I need it without a need to download all caches details. Also a return to last list would help a lot, as I many times accidentally pushed back button while on list of nearby caches, bringing me to the home screen and than I had to download all the cache list again - very &quot;pleasant&quot; with poor data signal.

		From support mail: I usually have quite some event caches saved and it is hard to remember where I already posted a &quot;Will attend&quot;. It could be an improvement to somehow mark this state in the cache list or at least the cache details (Status not &quot;Found&quot; but &quot;Will attend&quot;) Remark: The feature request to include your own logs in the Friends-log tab could also be an option, as the user has a quick possibility to check what he already logged for these caches.

		There is an option to remove past events but to remove all found caches an user has to sort them to have found on the top, tick all found and remove chosen, so three steps. An option to remove all found would do that in one step. The most important is that this option should remove only found and logged online (green color), not found and logged offline (orange color).

		I assume by the recent changes in the connector framework, the currently gc.com-specific 'more'-search was broken. Even though it is a regression, IMO it is not very critical. Instead of re-activating this short-term, we should rather try to generalize it (as it is available for OKAPI as well) mid-term.

		This is no bug in c:geo but I want to document this here as a reminder: The GPX file returned from ec.com seems not to include the information that the user already found the cache. This leads to the problem that already found caches are not shown as found. I contacted their support to ask whether this is intentional or not. Update: For the map API it is working.

			<description>
		This is no c:geo failure but an enhancement request to ec.com. I open this issue here to document the current restriction for us: The map API does not return the cache size information (the GPX however does). For me it makes sense to add this information as the c:geo users probably do not understand why the cache size is only shown for some EC-caches in a list (i.e. if the specific cache has been opened before).

		On Navigate menu, there are already some options for navigation that are shown only if specific application is installed, for example OruxMaps. Could you please add another option, the &quot;Pebble watch&quot;? The application for pebble and android app are already usable. They are available on the following link: https://github.com/WebMajstr-/pebble-cgeo In near future they will be also added to Google Play store and Pebble store that will presumably start in next weeks. Additionally, I've also prepared the code for C:Geo that communicates with Pebble app and should be inserted in cgeo.geocaching.apps.cache.navi package, so implementing this change should be really fast for you :) package cgeo.geocaching.apps.cache.navi;

    private static final String PACKAGE_NAME = &quot;com.webmajstr.pebble_gc&quot;;

    PebbleApp() {
        super(getString(R.string.cache_menu_pebble), R.id.cache_app_pebble, INTENT, PACKAGE_NAME);
    }

    @Override
    public void navigate(Activity activity, Geopoint point) {
        final Intent pebbleIntent = new Intent(INTENT);
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;latitude&quot;, point.getLatitude());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;longitude&quot;, point.getLongitude());
        activity.startActivity(pebbleIntent);
    }

    @Override
    public void navigate(Activity activity, Geocache cache) {
        final Intent pebbleIntent = new Intent(INTENT);
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;latitude&quot;, cache.getCoords().getLatitude());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;longitude&quot;, cache.getCoords().getLongitude());

		Version: 2013.12.26-NB Steps: Deactivate gc.com as cache source Activate another cache source instead (ec.com in my test) Start live map Result: No tiles are requested from gc.com tile server (which is OK) but still at the start of live map a single request to gc.com is done as the log proofs: 16:10:14.875 Debug cgeo 21327  GET http://www.geocaching.com/map/default.aspx
16:10:15.531 Debug cgeo 21327  200 (644 ms) GET http://www.geocaching.com/map/default.aspx
 I do not know if this is necessary for some reason, but I think we should not contact gc.com if the user is not using this cache source at all.

		Hi, sometimes I'm facing problem, that I log via field notes from computer and in that case I have caches not found in c:geo to get it to actual state it is needed to update caches, but it take some time and wastes gc.com servers. What about function which can update just Found/DNF/Attended ... from this url: http://www.geocaching.com/my/logs.aspx?s=1 ? It can download just one page for this purpose, which is much more acceptable than refreshing all caches. The only problem is that on that page we have name of cache and GUID, but not GC code.

		In settings &gt; system it's possible to move the database to the sd-card. But that don't work right on my Sony Xperia V. When I use that function the data gets moved from phone-storage to internal-storage instead of external sd-card. It would be very helpful if it would be possible to choose the right storage.

		It looks like DataStore.loadWaypoints() sometimes manage to initialize the lazy list with null. This, in turn, should only happen when geocode is blank. I think that in this case an empty collection should be returned instead of an empty list after writing an error message in the log. Another reason to not accept null as a completion value for a lazy list is that null represents a non-yet-completed lazy list, and subsequent calls to getList() will try to complete the list again. java.lang.NullPointerException

		Today I wanted to test some more with ec.com. With 2014.01.01-NB I do not see any requests to ec.com on the live map and consequently the map stays empty.

We should directly send the request for complete data if the cache is opened from the popup.

			<description>
		As in several other activities, the GPS is turned on when entering a cache list in onResume() and turned off (if noone else requires it) in onPause(). In parallel, we try to be clever by turning it off while refreshing caches, and turning if back on when the refresh is finished (regularly or through a user cancel). This two cycles do not cope well with each other. It led to #3521 where the GPS will stay turned on after we navigate away from the activity or from cgeo entirely. The fix is only partial, and will lead to the GPS not being turned on spontaneously when a list refresh is cancelled (but will resume regular behaviour when navigating away from the activity by going back in cgeo or by displaying the details of a cache). I think we try to be too clever here. The questions we should ask ourselves are: Do we need the GPS to be turned on while displaying a cache list? Do we need the GPS to be turned off while refreshing the caches? Note that keeping the GPS turned on may be overriden by an explicit user action (the user is always free to disable the GPS and this is easy to do from the status bar on most devices), and preserve an up-to-date distance and direction (if the GPS is used for it) for the caches displayed in the background window. What do you think we should be doing? Should we keep being clever or should we adopt more simple an approach?

		A discussion on facebook brought up this proposal: Do not open the map on the current position by default, but on the last remembered map position (which is not the last remembered device position!). Because people sometimes switch between map and lists (or settings, or...) and then have difficulties finding the previous (non center) location again. As a lot of people would expect the map to open at the current position normally, this somehow needs to be tied to a &quot;session&quot;. Such that if you use c:geo on Monday, it does not reopen at the old position on Tuesday, but on the current position. As Android does not really support this &quot;session&quot; concept well, I suggest to use the time delta as criteria. If the map is opened again in a time span of 1 hour, reopen the map at the last position, otherwise at the current position.

		We have a shortcut from the position label on the main screen to the GPS settings. The same action is invoked when clicking on the login labels instead. That seems counterintuitive, especially as the number of connectors (and labels) increases. We might want to open the connector settings instead on clicking there.

		While attaching pictures on my mobile (Samsung Galaxy S3) to a cache, I notice that the pictures get rotated. I've tried taking landscape and portrait and each time they are rotated. This happens when taking &quot;New&quot; pictures. Could the problem be fixed, or provide a way for the picture to be rotated in the app? Very happy to provide any extra information.

		This is not clearly reproducible, but with 2014.01.12-NB-95a511b I had problems today with images of saved caches. Sometimes it looked like this: However I can not reproduce this case up to now. I just wanted to create this issue as there might be a connection to the recent changes.

		A handful of users on support mail and FB are reporting that they experience force closes regularly when trying to open saved caches. It helped to reset c:geo to factory defaults in all cases, however one user investigated a bit more and reported this: If the option &quot;Last Details page&quot; is active, those crashes are happening. Switching that option off everything is OK. I can not reproduce this using the current market version, but the explanation is somehow trustworthy. Any idea ?

		2014.01.17-NB This issue happens also in other scenarios but this one is reproducible for me : Open a list Select Manage -&gt; Import from internet &quot;Waiting for caches&quot; dialog shown Cancel Select again Manage -&gt; Import from internet Nothing happens I have the feeling this also happens on the first try if other operations to that list (e.g. delete, move, refresh) have been done before. Leaving and reentering the list makes it work again (for one time).

		I use to have a list of solved mysteries/mlutis (i.e. final coordinates are available from gc.com). If I map this list and select &quot;Map settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Show circles&quot; nothing happens. I think this is due to the rule not to draw circles for multi/mystery and probably other cache types with no container at the listing coordinates. However we should draw circles if the final coords are set (caches with flag-marker on map).

		If I open a new log window on an oc cache, that requires a log password and it opens as 'note' (because I already found the cache), the box for entering the log password isn't made visible when I change the log type to found. Consequently sending the log will fail. If I close and re-open the (stored) log, the password box is visible correctly.

		Hi all, the compass isn't working for c:geo after the last update to 2014.01.22. I'm using the ASUS MeMO Pad hd 7 (me173x) OS: Android 4.2.2 Build: ME173X_WW_user_4.2.4.72702_20131128 Other Apps like GPS status are able to use the build-in compass.

		Galaxy SIII device it seems no matter what device or c:geo setting I use, I cannot get the blue 'cursor' to point up, and have the map rotate around the direction of travel. this is most frustrating when driving to a cache, or trying to make sense of upside down maps when walking to a cache. Any help appreciated.

		From the German geocaching forum (translation by me): My current observation is, that after the phone has been in sleep-mode for a longer time, c:geo is not able to re-activate the GPS. Neither the new location symbol from Android nor the GPS symbol is shown. After stopping and re-starting c;geo it works again. (Android 4.4, cyanogenmod 11, HTC one, c:geo NB from 27.01.2014 probably) (Original text from http://forum.geoclub.de/viewtopic.php?p=1154170#p1154170): Allerdings, nach meiner bisherigen Beobachtung, wenn das Handy offensichtlich längere Zeit im Sleepmodus war, kriegt c:geo GPS nicht wieder aktiviert. Weder das neue Lokalisationssymbol von Android noch das GPS-Symbols eines GPS-Tools erscheint dann wieder in der Statusleiste. Der Workaround geht folgendermaßen: c:geo abschießen und neu starten, danach funktioniert GPS auch wieder.

		2014.02.05-NB If I start navigation from a cache using Radar (with GPSStatus) the target coords are not the desired coords but some which have nothing to do with that cache. I did not get my PC running with logcat yet, but I would guess the radar uses the last target coords it has and we for some reason stopped handing over coords when calling the Radar. Please try to reproduce, maybe there is a problem with my installation.

		@YraFyra @triakcz @RomNexus6 @Bazsy @ray4423 @MichielK @mieczyslaw @seromenho @scrool @campbeb As we now have completed the first phase to sync our translations to Crowdin (see #2468 for details) we would like to invite all our translation contributors to Crowdin. Feel free to sign up (free) on Crowdin, find the c:geo project (https://crowdin.net/project/cgeo) and start translating right away. Additionally we would like to assign at least one proofreader (which is a account role on Crowdin) for each language. A proofreader will have the right to set translations to &quot;Approved&quot;, which means that they will be imported into the c:geo source at next import. If you are interested in becoming a proofreader, just reply here. If you encounter problems while translating/proofreading cou can either ask here or try the &quot;Raise Issue&quot; function on Crowdin. (We do not know yet, what will be the best way.) Your help is appreciated!

		This is a continuation of #3425 which has already been partially implemented. Currently as implemented within the app, the scanner only supports the geocaching.com url for trackables and not the shorter coord.info url. This Userscript http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95134 now supports trackable pages using the coord.info url.

		This was already reported by Ticketautomat and issue is closed - but not solved. I am annoyed about the language setting of my account in gc.com is so often switched to English. I wrote to GC about it. Their answer was a question: Do I use some other application that uses the gc account? Of course I do - c:geo. Now I made some tests: C:geo is off. Then several log-ins and log-outs on gc homepage. Language stayed always German (fine). One log-in with c:geo, then next log-in on gc homepage shows language setting changed to English (bad). This is reproducable. I don't even have to log-out and re-log-in on the web site to see this language change. It is sufficient to start c:geo and then press F5 (refresh) in my PC web browser to see the language change to English. Either the app does the language switch or the gc api does it implicitly in the backend when it is used by c:geo. Please help.

		I am using Version 2014.02.04 in the moment. When I open a list I can use the &quot;filter&quot;-menu to show only special kinds of caches like &quot;with changed coordinates&quot;. I like to use the &quot;show on map&quot;-menu for that results. I have the app locus installed so after use this menu entry I get asked wich map I like to use. When I chose to watch the caches in locus everything is OK. But when I use the cgeo-map for it I get not only the filter-result-caches but all chaches on the list.

		Hi c:geo team, when I sort a list by status (active, disabled, archived), I delete an archived cache and the previous sorting is lost (back to default sorting). I have to sort again by status to find again the archived caches, and so on... release 2014.02.04 on Android 4.2 Thanks for you daily job, anyway. Tof

		From support: I've started to use c:geo as an alternative app for geocaching and i have a major problem. When I try to add a new log to cache, the option is faded out. I just can't log through c:geo that i found a cache. I've tried to reinstall it, and authorize it again but nothing seems to work. I'm using opencaching.pl website. App version is 2014.02.04, android version - 4.1.2 (Samsung Galaxy S2).

		Hi, I'm using IntelliJ IDEA (which Android Studio is based on) for Android development. I would like to add a project file (*.iml file) to the repository and ignore workspace specific settings (like which device to use). The main reason is, that I can't commit those changes in my forked project without including them in my pull requests (or can I?). So either I don't commit those changes or I delete this commit before each pull request - both are a little bit annoying. Furthermore, with Google switching from Eclipse to Android Studio it is just a matter of time for other software developers to follow.

			<description>
		This bug occurs only using OSM and offline maps. Tapping with two fingers on the screen causes the map to zoom out (I assume this is a feature). The problem comes while pinching, which normally zooms in/out the map. But if it's done too quickly, the screen either zooms out or doesn't zoom at all. This depends on how big the pinch movement is. Fast and short pinch = zoom out, fast and long pinch = nothing happens (i.e. the map zooms in while pinching, as any map would, but it returns to the same zoom level after releasing). It seems like the two-finger-tap is triggered, if a pinch movement is too quick. This would explain the behavior: quick short pinch = &quot;nothing&quot; from map + &quot;zoom out&quot; from tap =&gt; zoom out quick long pinch = &quot;zoom in&quot; from map + &quot;zoom out&quot; from tap =&gt; nothing happens Since Google Maps doesn't have this two-finger-tap feature, it doesn't occur there.

		A user reported that setting the type filter to &quot;Wherigo&quot; shows many different caches on the live map which shouldn't be there. I tested it and made the following observations: Prerequisites: Enable global cache type filter &quot;Wherigo&quot; Choose live map strategy &quot;fast&quot; Do not have any caches in the database for the testing region (e.g. clear data before) Premium member? Observations: All caches are ?? although I zoomed in to &quot;200 m&quot; These ?? include: traditional, multi, unknown, etc. (all cache types?) But not all caches are shown, only a small subset (but with many types) Leave the live map and return to it (maybe unnecessary) Some Wherigo symbols appear. Open one of them and it will change its type to &quot;Earthcache&quot; (also other types?) If you need an area to test it, try Hanover in Germany.

		Although there are caches (e.g. GC2JV5X) which have more then 999 Favorite points, c:geo stops counting at that number. I understand there is not enough space below the symbol in the lists for a 4 digit number. But at least in the cache detail view, there is plenty of space. Beside: Thx for the great app

		When an image is embedded in the cache description there is currently no possibility to download or open the image with another app. Only by opening the cache in the browser. You should add a long-press feature on images with the context menu choices &quot;Download image&quot; and &quot;Open image&quot;. That would be really useful when trying to solve Unknown caches on the field!

			<description>
		It's a proposal for a new feature: support a new type of cache for c:geo users only, in the spirit of Wherigo caches but simpler and focused on audio. I like Wherigos, especially the idea of moving from WP to WP, with automatic unblocking of the next WP once the current one has been reached. But Wherigos are rather rare because it's a pain to build one, and they are more often visual than audio-based. I also like audio-only guidance, because it's a much better experience, especially when biking. So, putting it all together, I propose to work on the following simple type of cache, to start with: create the cache by moving along a path; press a button at each WP and record a voice message, simply from within c:geo at play time, you put earphones, take your bike, launch c:geo and move to the next WP with some audio guidance; when you reach the WP, you hear the pre-recorded message and the next WP unblocks and becomes automatically your next target, so that you don't (eventually) need to stop and look at your phone. Such caches would run only in c:geo; they're more complex than standard, simpler than multis but also more dynamic, and putting this all within c:geo would make the creation of such trails way easier, and I suspect would greatly increase their number. I can work on this, if you think it's interesting...

		Using 2014.03.19-NB (but probably existing much longer) It happens sporadically when scrolling or zooming the map that waypoints are still shown although the defined limit of caches shown is reached. I have set the &quot;hide waypoint on map&quot; limit to 10. I scrolled to an area on the map with well over 10 caches but still the waypoints are shown. Only after another manual operation (e.g. zoom out and zoom in again or scroll in one direction and back to the orginal position) the waypoints are correctly hidden. I can give no clear instruction of when this error shows up but my feeling is, that it happens after several zoom and scroll operations. To make this more clear, here are some screenshots: Map drawing not correct (limit 10, 15 caches shown) After moving the map just a little bit forth and back it updates and hides the waypoints as it should:

		Over the last months there is a mentionable amount of users (most probably also new to Geocaching itself) that use the app without a valid login and claim problems which results from that. Besides the fact, that we should not load any data from gc.com without login (that would prevent problems like &quot;The coordinates are always wrong&quot;,etc.), we should give some advice at the first start that a login for some platform is needed. Currently the app starts at the platform selection in Settings -&gt; Services, but it seems some users are helpless here and just press back, get to the main menu and start using it in a &quot;wrong way&quot;. I suggest to implement a screen on the very first start with some explaining words like &quot;On the following page the geocaching platforms supported by c:geo are listed. You need an existing account on at least on of this sites to use c:geo. c:geo will not create an account for you, but you need to enter the user credentials provided to you after registering to the specific geocaching website. Please press OK to get to the list of supported platforms and enter your existing user credentials before starting to use c:geo&quot;

		Current situation: If the user enables &quot;Use GPS only&quot; in the compass menu, this setting is persistent. It affects not only the compass but also other directional views (e.g. pointer on live map). There are quite a number of users on support mail with &quot;compass problems&quot;, where it turns out this settings was active (either accidently or because it was once needed for a special purpose and forgotten afterwards). I suggest to change this settings to be &quot;session based&quot; and defaults back to &quot;Use Compass and GPS&quot; (only if the device has a compass sensor of course). The other option would be to have a clear indication somewhere, that the magnetic sensor is disabled.

		On my bike tour today I had problems with logging. Although the mobile data connection shows best quality H+ it sometimes fails to send logs. But not only. cgeo was blocked until I killed it. Users should have a chance to either try sending log in background or make this a cancelable dialog. I know that this will increase the chance of double log entries. Maybe something like &quot;send to background&quot;? But then we would need a feedback interface, don't we?

		I would love a feature to add a waypoint from the map view by long pressing on a position on the map and choose &quot;Navigate to&quot; or &quot;Add waypoint&quot; in a context menu. The only way to add a waypoint today is to enter the coordinates manually or read from the Notes. This feature would be particularly useful when trying to navigate to a suitable parking place.

		From FB: Event caches still go to will attend even on the day of event. I thought it used to change to attended. In #2709 it was introduced that &quot;Attended&quot; is the default for past events. I agree that this could be extended also to cover the day of the event itself, as most people will probably log a &quot;Will Attend&quot; some days before and &quot;Attended&quot; on the very date.

		Today I was on tour. First I logged a cache. But no smiley appeared on map. I didn't think more about because sometimes it changes on move. Another cache I needed to update. It was archived and the cache icon shows grey but it didn't disappear because it was stored? However, so I removed the cache and the disc image disappeared but the grey archived cache resided. Another cache updated and removed but icon with disc resided. Another cache I removed without update because now I knew the whole series was archived. The icon didn't change a bit. I killed cgeo between but the icons stay on map although they are removed. Strange behaviour. NB 2014-03-27 I know caching last sunday the icon changed to smiley and disappeared from map.

		From Playstore comment (unverified): Great app but coordinate conversions are incorrect since downloading new version. For example, using DDD.DDDDD°, I typed in N 32.6486 W 109.8197 and it was converted to 32°03.892 109°04.918. The correct conversion is 32°38.916 109°49.182. Note the decimal point error.

		The cache GC245X3 has 243 images (which is quite unusual but good for testing purposes). When opening the image tab I can see that a certain amount of pictures but not all are loaded. Depending on the used device the amount of pictures loaded differs, but some keep missing. With the debug log it is hard to distinguish whether all of them are requested and some not returned or we just stop requesting. That would need further analysis. Anyway it ends up with having &quot;spinning circles&quot; as placeholder for some of the pictures but no more network traffic ongoing.

			<description>
		Currently on a new installation the input format for entering coordinates (the coordinate dialogue in various parts of the app) is set to &quot;Plain&quot;. In many discussions with users I have seen that they were not aware of this setting and complained about the difficult input method. I suggest setting the initial default to MinDec ( DD° MM.MMM') instead as this is the most common format used throughout the geocaching world.

		From @YraFyra: The current implementation is first looking at the Alias field. If no match is found then DisplayName is searched. However, this search is done using the '=' thus only matching full names. I suggest to using &quot;LIKE&quot; as operator and &quot;%GcAlias%&quot; as pattern to really find the best candidates. Of course this may return more that one match and therefore I added a simple optionsmenu to select which contact to open. and let me add to this: I use to store most caching contacts in this format: Max TheCacher Mustermann or just Max TheCacher where the geocaching name (TheCacher) is either the middle name or the last name. I think some users might do alike, so I would prefer if these formats are also matched (I dont't know if this is implicit in the proposal above).

		Hi, since the last update, the compass has a deviation of -90° when holding the device in landscape mode. I'm running Android 4.2.2 with a Kernel 3.4.5 on a ASUS ME173X (Built ME173X_WW_user_4.2.4.72702_20131128) If I have another app using the compass, like GPS Status, it works well when turning the device. Rebooting and locking the screen in landscape mode doesn't have any effect.

		With market release 2014.04.01: Switch off GPS Start c:geo The main screen shows &quot;Last position&quot; and correct coordinates for the last known location Perform nearby search Results are according to the last known location Open live map Result: No pointer/arrow shown The map starts up where it was last opened position or even defaults to N0/E0 (in case c:geo was not running before) Clicking on the &quot;my location&quot; button has no effect Expected: Last known location should be used as starting point for the map If possible the arrow should mark the last known location I am using a new device, so I am not sure whether this is a new issue or just device depending?!

		I find it very annoying that the map zooms out to show all caches in the current list every time I press the Map Icon in the list view. I have to zoom in to a more suitable level to locate a nearby cache, only to get all the caches again after pressing the Map icon later. It would be great if the zoom level should be remembered from time to time when viewing the list map. You could add a &quot;Remember Zoom Level/Show all caches&quot; option in the Map settings menu.

		2014.04.05-NB (but probably exisiting since the recent changes to the long click events): It happens to me quite often, that when trying a long click on a cache in a list the context menu opens but shortly after that the cache details are opened and the context menu vanishes. It is quite easy to reproduce: When you do a really long click the context menu opens as expected When you do a really short click the details are opened as expected If you do a click which is just at the time limit of a long click the described problem shows up

		You will for sure remember the problems and discussions about The menu button no longer working starting with a certain API level(?) Some devices not having a HW menu button (but only some workaround like long-press on another button or a menu switch for showing a on-screen three-dot icon) Regarding 2. we always have quite some mails on support although it is mentioned in our FAQ. Currently only some not widespread devices are affected, but I got the following news today: Samsung will replace the menu button with the recent-app/app-switch button on all new handsets starting with the Galaxy S5. The legacy menu button is only available by long-press on this app-switch button on these devices. That makes me think, that we should put more focus on introducing our own menu button (e.g. action bar sherlock).

If I log a OP- and a GC-cache offline and export the fiels notes only the GC-cache is contained in the file. I am not familiar with the field note support on OC-sites but I can confirm the behavior (possibly the same for all non-GC caches).

		2014.04.20-NB (but most probably not new in this version): For my holiday I stored a list with an imported PQ of 1000 caches. This slows down a c:geo a lot: Scrolling through the lists is stuttering not always but most of the time Opening a single cache from the ist and returning from the cache to the list takes considerable time (1-2 seconds) The situation gets worse in the following scenario: Open cache list with 1000 caches Apply a filter (e.g. Attribut -&gt; Medium hike) Open details of a cache from the filtered list Return to the list In this scenario two things are noticeable: Even the attribut selection list in the filter menu is stuttering when scrolling It takes 7-10 seconds until the list is shown after the last step Setting label &quot;Unverified&quot; as I have no possibility to take a log currently. Mabye someone can try to reproduce with a 1000-PQ. This is one of my usual holiday usecases and I never experienced such problems before (last time used in February). It is not related to the mini-compass (tested by disabling it in settings).

			<description>
		Seen with 2014.04.21-NB and also read about it on IRC: Sometimes when using the filters it seems to be possible to apply a combination of filters (i.e. after selecting one filter, select another one and both are applied). While this can make sense for some usecases, there seem to be problems with that: Only the latest selected filter is shown in the headline of the list Sometimes applying a new filter seems to cancel the filter applied before (not sure under which conditions) but not always. Sometimes selecting &quot;Reset filter&quot; does not really cancel them, but still only a subset of the caches on the list is shown but there is no UI indication anymore, that there is still something filtered out Will check if I find a reproducible case for this one.

			<description>
		Currently, our geocache objects have a reference to their log entry list. Therefore a cache that has once loaded its log entries (during import, displaying, export, or filtering) will consume a lot of memory for the strings in the logs for a long time. A refactoring will make log entries own top level objects, which are loaded/stored directly from/to database. Initial measurements show that this cuts down overall memory consumption for a use case of importing 500 caches from GPX to 40% of the current memory usage.

		Import the GPX from GC53HTM. The XML parser freaks out, as that is invalid XML (due to a bad character reference � in the file). I've been trying to remove this using a ReaderFilter as described in http://info.tsachev.org/2009/05/skipping-invalid-xml-character-with.html, but that implementation only works for invalid characters as such, not for invalid character references. Now we could implement our own character reference detection, in a FilterReader, but to me that looks like a very big gun. Does anyone see an easier solution? Just to be crystal clear: I know this is a bug on the GC.com side, but nevertheless I would like to fix it in our app.

		Today I wanted to copy waypoint coords from c:geo to the clipboard in order to use them for calculation in another app. It seems not to be easily possible to do that; you can actually copy either latitude or longitude (if format &quot;plain&quot; is selected) to the clipboard but not the whole string like it is supported for the cache coordinates itself (long click on coords). For pasting coords from clipboard into a new waypoint there is a similar &quot;problem&quot;. If you paste them into the latitude field of course the complete string (with lat and lon) is pasted in one field which is wrong. Here some more intelligence is needed or it would need an option like &quot;Create wapoint with clipboard content&quot;

I guess it should be 'permanent'. I don't know if this is the right place for filing this 'bug', but I don't know who has access to the developer console. Keep the awesome work up!

		In the latest release the option to navigate using &quot;MapsWithMe&quot; has been added. On my device, selecting MapsWithMe from the navigate menu pops-up an option to install MapsWithMe even though it's already installed on my system. Clicking on one of those options takes me to the GooglePlayStore page for MapsWithMe. I suspect the problem is because I didn't purchase MapsWithMe from GooglePlayStore, I bought it from AndroidPit on a special offer. There is a workaround: if I select &quot;Ext. map&quot; from the Navigate menu, one of the options is MapsWithMe and if I select it there it works fine.

		Yesterday I saw the GPS totally not working on the mobile of my father. It was basically hanging at zero coordinates although it was switched on. My father was not able to detect this bad state, as the app was not indicating it. However, when inspecting the phone for the reason of all his caches being away some thousand kilometers, I noticed a very awkward display in the left lower corner. The satellite fix was shown as 4/0. If I remember the code right, the second number should always be larger or equal to the first. If so, then we should indicate such a sensor reading as error state and display this to the user maybe.

		Normally when we use the &quot;my position&quot; button in our maps then it becomes centered on my position and stays there also in other zoom levels. Yesterday I sometimes was not in the screen center when using this button. Zooming in could then even lead to moving the blue arrow to outside the screen, on pressing the button. This only happened, when I opened a map for a list of about 1000 caches and had very bad network. So bad that the Google map background would not load at all.

		It seems to me that the GPX files exported from c:geo are no longer readable by Garmin. I'm using the export function to generate GPX files that I then upload to my Garmin device (Garmin Oregon 450t). This worked like a charm for years already. With the last c:geo update (version 2014.04.30) I happily noticed that the process of exporting GPX files significantly sped up. However, the resulting files are no longer accepted by my Garmin device. I tested this with an older GPX file that I generated with c:geo as well and that file worked just fine again.

		2014.05.07-NB Received a GPX file (exported from cgeo) via mail Opened the file in my mail program Selected c:geo as target app c:geo opens and asks for a list to store the caches After selecting the list nothing happens (only the list is shown) Manually importing the file (via Manage -&gt; Import GPX) works without a problem. I am not sure whether this used to work before with my mail client, therefore setting &quot;Unverified&quot;. But IMO it should work if c:geo can be selected when opening the file, or not?

With the current 2014.05.11-NB I can still see, that this procedure is not working. MapFactor Navigator is started but remains on the startup screen. Hint: If I use this procedure I can start navigation with MapFactor Navigator: Open cache details Menu -&gt; Navigate -&gt; &quot;Google Maps Route&quot; Select the app: &quot;MapFactor Navigator&quot; @Bananeweizen : Disregard my email concerning Sygic navigation.

		In 5133e10 @samueltardieu introduced a call to VACUUM (shrink) the c:geo db during database clean. On my device (HTC Evo 3D, Android 4.0.3) this takes quite some time: 05-11 13:24:12.720: D/cgeo(31003): Database clean: vacuuming the freed space
05-11 13:27:25.828: D/cgeo(31003): Database clean: finished
 Depending on the point in time when the call starts, the cache count may already have been initialized or not. In the latter case, c:geo was reported to crash on almost every action. The times were measured after stopping c:geo in task manager (otherwise the cleanup routine might not be called) Are these times exceptional?

		The cache reviewer told me that I am required to set the &quot;Wireless Beacon Required&quot; for my cache ( GC53WJ0 ). Now on geocaching.com this reads simply as &quot;Wireless Beacon Required&quot; - but c:geo displays (at least in German): &quot;Cache mit Funk-Sender (Chirp)&quot;. But Chirps are proprietary and therefore not usable without an alternative way to get to the coordinates. I used some other form of wireless beacon which is non-proprietary and does therefore not have to be optional. Solution: remove the &quot;(Chirp)&quot; Hint and rely on the Cache Listing to specify what kind of Beacon is being used.

		When I start c:geo (2014.05.11-NB) I have to wait 15-20 seconds until the lists are accesible. If I immediately try to open the list after c:geo gas started I get a delayed reaction followed by a black screen for the mentioned time. If I just wait on the main screen I can see, that the amount of saved caches is only shown after the mentioned time. Might be connected to 5133e10 (as written in comments there). Strangely this happens to me on each &quot;cold start&quot; of c:geo although I would expect (as stated by @samueltardieu) that there is nothing to clean up after it has been performed once.

		I find the street names on the maps much too small to be readable. Both on Google maps and on OSM. If I compare with the Google Maps App the street names are much bigger. As a result you have to zoom more to show more street names. I have a nexus 5 with a resolution of 1920x1080 and 445 ppi Is there a way to customize the font size depending on the unit's resolution? There should be a map font size setting if possible. The &quot;Scale Map Text&quot; option does not seem to have any effect for online maps. Google Maps in C:geo Google Maps App

			<description>
		2014.05.12-NB: For testing another issue I imported 4000 caches to a list. This slows down the UI significantly: When leaving the cache details back to that list, it takes around 3-5 seconds to open the list. App not responsive during that time. Applying a filter takes up to 10 seconds. App not responsive during that time. Deleting a subset of the caches on the list (e.g. preselected by applying a filter) most often leads to an ANR-error.

		I know, that this is not the main purpose of a geocaching app, but this request is made really often via support mail, so I would like to place it here and not simply deny a function a lot of users want to have: Have an option on the compass screen to turn on/off the camera-LED of my smartphone (e.g. a graphical button on the compass screen) I also link those users to apps supporting this via the notification screen or some key-shortcut, but I have to admit that this is probably some usage steps more than just clicking on the screen in your geocaching app. I assume there is some free code for this, so it would IMHO require just a button triggering that function?!

		Interesting idea on support mail: When I click on a cache on the map it shows me more or less the same info as if I click &quot;More Details&quot; afterwards. (D/T, Size, etc.) I prefer to always look at the complete page instead. Can you perhaps add an option to simply ommit the popup and directly open the cache on click.

		Here is a first quick approach of my suggested order of the menu items and settings of &quot;Always show&quot; / &quot;Show if room&quot; as far as I understood the implementation. Please correct me if I am wrong with the possibilites of the viewing options. My goal was to keep the UI as much as possible like the old one to allow the user to find items they are used to, but additionally improve the handling where e.g. an addtional actionbar item could make the handling easier. I am sure this can only be the base of the discussion and it might be a bit too conservative. Main screen: a. History b. PQ c. Settings d. Scan Geocode e. Useful apps f. About c:geo &quot;Dont show action&quot; for all to keep the main menu alike to the exiting one Lists: a. Map List b. Manage c. Sort d. Filter e. Select mode f. Show on Map (different to a as it invokes a dialog for the target app) &quot;Show action&quot; a+ b &quot;Dont show action&quot; c,d,e,f Cache details: a. Prefered navigation (preferably long press for secondary navigation if possible, see #3843) b. Secondary prefered navigation (if not possible to include in a) c. Log Visit d. Navigate e. Caches around f. Open in browser g. Share &quot;Show action&quot; a +b (if we can ommit b somehow c should also be shown) &quot;Dont show action&quot; (c),d,e,f,g TB-details: a. Log TB b. Open in browser &quot;Show action&quot; for all Cache logging: a. Signature (ideally only if autoinsert is not active, if possible) b. Add c. Smiley d. GCVote &quot;Show action&quot; for all TB-logging: a. Add b. Smiley c. Signature &quot;Show action&quot; for all Any location: to be completed (I think the whole screen needs to be reworked, refer to #3770)

		As discussed on IRC it might be useful to have more meaningful icons for some menu items as they are now possibly displayed as &quot;icon only&quot; on the actionbar and probably not every user will know, that he can get the text by long press. What I found not be intuitivein my opinion: &quot;Navigate&quot; icon (e.g. in cache details) It is using the same icon as we already use for &quot;Map a List&quot;, which should be avoided The usage of the map icon is now inconsistent: In lists = Show list on map In cache details = Navigate &quot;Open in browser&quot; icon This is just an (i) which IMO suggests to the user that it provides more details in c:geo instead of opening an external browser &quot;Smiley&quot; icon Its somehow OK and recognizable if you tried it once...but what is it? :-) Feel free to comment or add some others you think are misleading.

		Just another proposal: In the sense of migration from old to new UI we should show icons + text in the overflow for two main reasons IMO: Users know the icons from the old UI, so it helps them to find the menu items in the new UI If icons jump from the overflow menu to the action bar (e.g. on different devices or when turning to landscape) the user will recognize them as the icon is &quot;permanent&quot; and find it again much faster.

		Since the last update, the app has become generally very laggy. I have noticed that when using the live maps, if you try to save one item to an existing or new list the app starts to hang. At first it doesn't seem to want to allow you to move around the lists created, it just pauses after 10 seconds - it either catches up but still laggy or a warning that the app has stopped (would you like to wait or force close). Please can this be fixed in the next release/update.

		Version 2014.05.22-NB-19a24f4 Go to saved caches Caches are sorted by distance Select list &quot;Verlauf&quot; (english translation?) edit Lineflyer: History Select any other list Caches in other list are sorted differently (log date?) Go to menu, sorting I see sort order &quot;log date&quot; I select sort order &quot;distance&quot; Order does not change Checking menu, &quot;sorting&quot; again, it still shows &quot;log date&quot; Same happens when jumping to &quot;Verlauf&quot; directly from main screen, and selecting any other list there. It seems as if selecting list &quot;Verlauf&quot; locks sort order to log date. It gets unlocked when going back to main screen and selecting &quot;saved caches&quot; again. Then ordering is by distance, until i select &quot;Verlauf&quot; again. Expected behaviour: Restore previous sort order when going from &quot;Verlauf&quot; to any other list.

		Currently only the version code is checked to trigger opening of the changelog on app start. Additionally the hash code of the file(s) itself should be checked to only show the changelog if both conditions are met (i.e. there is something changed in the changelog). This will prevent triggering the changelog on each new NB. Thanks for the idea @Bananeweizen Assigning @rsudev as requested

		Currently there is still an action separated from the actionbar to show a list on map. We should take this as first action into the actionbar instead which will lead to the same result AFAIK. Remark/Problem: We will then have two items with same naming and similar functions in the actionbar.

			<description>
		Today a user told me that c:geo shows &quot;0 m/h&quot; as the speed. That's not miles per hour, but meters per hour. getSpeed() calls getDistanceFromKilometers() which calls scaleDistance():             if (distanceKilometers &gt;= 1) {
                distance = distanceKilometers;
                units = &quot;km&quot;;
            } else {
                distance = distanceKilometers * 1000;
                units = &quot;m&quot;;
            } That means that the string will contain m/h as long as the speed is below 1 km/h. It looks like this behavior is intended.             TestSettings.setUseImperialUnits(false);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 km/h&quot;, 122.782f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 km/h&quot;, 123.456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;12.3 km/h&quot;, 12.3456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;1.23 km/h&quot;, 1.23456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 m/h&quot;, 0.123456f);
            TestSettings.setUseImperialUnits(true);
            assertSpeed(&quot;76.7 mph&quot;, 123.456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;7.67 mph&quot;, 12.3456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;0.77 mph&quot;, 1.23456f);
 I wonder if this high precision is really necessary. Before committing my changes I want to get feedback for the following results:             TestSettings.setUseImperialUnits(false);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 km/h&quot;, 122.782f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 km/h&quot;, 123.456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;12 km/h&quot;, 12.3456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;1 km/h&quot;, 1.23456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;0 km/h&quot;, 0.123456f);
            TestSettings.setUseImperialUnits(true);
            assertSpeed(&quot;77 mph&quot;, 123.456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;8 mph&quot;, 12.3456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;1 mph&quot;, 1.23456f);

		This is my first post here and firstly I would like to thank you for great free geochacing application:) Everything works fine but I miss a option to disable download a pictures for offline use. Sometimes there is a situation when I arrive first time to town with a lot of cashes around. First thing what I want to do is to fast download a caches around and go caching. Downloading with pictures (especially a lot of caches) takes quite a long time.

		Today I tested upgrading v0.29 to v0.30. Firefox 29.0.1 Gresemonkey 1.15 Existing v0.29 installation take from here: f3b46da I opened the script manager of Greasemonkey, then right clicked on the existing send2geo installation and selected &quot;Look for Updates&quot; It detected and updated the script to v0.30 (at least it is shown now in the script lists) Looking deeper by using &quot;Edit script&quot; it turns out the script is still v0.29 (and still not working on live map). Can someone retest this please ?

		With the new UI, the title of a cache list is only updated after loading the complete list. Until then it is basically empty. This makes the spinner &quot;triangle&quot; in the actionbar jump around every time you open a cache list. While we don't know the number of caches in advance, we should at least set the title of the list before we actually load its caches, to avoid that &quot;jumping&quot;.

		I have seen that GCC (GeoCache Calculator app) is a navigation option in c:geo. Why is that? AFAICS is it only starting GCC without any interaction with the cache I call it. If there is no interaction, there is no need at this point to call this external app.

		To me the progress of refreshing caches looks quite confusing (just testing in the wild). It always jumps from 0 to 2, and it reaches 100% some time before the dialog closes (probably when it starts downloading the last cache). Looks like an off by one error somehow. Is that just my imagination? For reproduction, take GC caches only, as all other sources are to fast.

		checkout: http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC53NJM_circumvallatielinie-1 Watch the order of the waypoints at the bottom Now load the same cache in c:geo. Look at the waypoints, the order is different from the website. It looks like that reference points are displayed first. But in this case the reference point is a kind of &quot;walked by&quot;/via point, the waypoints should be kept in the website order. Maybe its not a bug but a change request (in case its intended to have a different order than the website), cannot determine that. c:geo:2014.5.14 Android:4.2.2 samsung:S3mini

		I have noted that several caches I had done where not uploaded to geocaching.com when exporting field notes. At first I did not realize why, but now I think that if I open a cache through &quot;search nearby caches&quot;, then log it as &quot;found&quot;, then go back to export field notes, it is not uploaded.

		I found the faq to make the change. However I can not find a main menu / settings or appearance. Nor has it changed automatically. It was fine on my old Motorola phone, but now I have a Samsung Galaxy S 5. How can I change to imperial units ? c:geo uses metric units by default but should be able to detect if you are using a local setting which defaults to imperial units and will adapt to it automatically. A manual change can be done in c:geo settings (main screen, Press menu, Select settings, Select Appearance) and select &quot;Use Imperial units&quot;.

		This one is difficult to describe: I am very sure, that in the past it was possible to open an OC-cache and have an inventory page shown with the listed geokrets. It was also possible to click on the inventory and see the details of the geokret. Today with 2014.06.03-NB I have seen that this is obviously no longer working. I continued and tested it with the last market release 2014.05.14, but even there it seems not to work anymore. I am unsure whether it stopped working some time before that, or it is a problem of the API or it is a problem of switching to the new API. @rsudev Possibly you are the right one to answer that. Example: OCB92E which has a virtual geokret always logged into that cache

		From FB: Galaxy S2 Slimkat 4.3 - Upper Right (3-dot) Menu Button works, hardware key does not - menu opens, but none of the menu items are selectable. I'm sure it's a nightly issue, but wanted to let you know anyways. Keep up the good work! I asked the following and waiting for answer: Thanks for the feedback. Please allow some questions (either here or via support mail): Is this a Custom 4.3 ROM? Please check the setting for the three-dot button in Menu - Settings - Appearance. Any change depending on its setting? Version of the nightly build

		Not sure whether a special case or a general bug: I have a cache where I see the friend log (only log on friend logbook page) doubled in the normal logbook page. The cache has only 18 logs, so all its logs are contained in the normal logbook page. 2014.06.06-NB

		Can we get a progress callback from our network download method? I'm currently sitting at the end of the world where sometimes there is network and sometimes there is not. So when staring at the download progress pop-up of the cache details activity I'm often wondering if my device is getting any data at all. Just displaying the number of received bytes there would really help to understand what is going on. Bonus points for getting the overall number of to be transferred bytes from the HTTP header and showing a percentage.

		We had several user reports issues with hangs/ANRs after unlocking a phone that has been locked on the map screen for an extended period (10 mins till over 1 hour). Digging into this I was able to see, that the unsubscribe in CGeoMap.onPause does not stop the LoadTimerAction from being called. According to my limited knowledge this is what unsubscribe is for. I was unable to finally deduce if this is an implementation Problem (incorrect Api usage) or a bug in rxJava. If the latter is true, it seems to be present even in the latest 0.19.0 version (I could not fully switch to that, but had to fake/comment out stuff related to the GeoDir handler in order to build it) Any of the more experienced (@samueltardieu @Bananeweizen ) that can shed some light on this or provide pointers for further research?

		I have just been looking at the code for the &quot;edit destination&quot; menu of the compass. That does nothing than just invoke the &quot;Any edit&quot; activity and cancel the compass activity itself. To me that is confusing (as the compass is gone afterwards) and is basically not related to the compass at all. I suggest to remove this menu, especially as there is still the &quot;select destination&quot; menu item, which allows to select one of the waypoints of the cache as destination. Comments?

		From support mail. Any idea? I have a problem authorizing opencaching.de with cgeo. After I'm redirected to the opencaching site, I answer to authorize with yes, then a URL is invoked in the browser that begins with &quot; callback://www.cgeo.org[...] &quot; Of course the browser gives an error. I think this callback-function is supposed to open cgeo, not a browser page.   I'm using a Pipo T9 Talk Tablet with 4.2.2 and lightning browser.

When zooming to 50m, 20m or 10m the stages disappear after turning and do not appear again since I zoom out to 100m. The configured number of caches to show waypoint was above the shown waypoints.

		According to our FAQ and my experience we support all of the date formats of gc.com except dd/MM/yyyy as we can not differentiate it from MM/dd/yyyy So we support and detect: yyyy-MM-dd yyyy/MM/dd MM/dd/yyyy dd/MMM/yyyy MMM/dd/yyyy dd MMM yy See: http://faq.cgeo.org/#1_6 Right now the amount of people having problems with log dates and contacting us has raised. I checked the website and have seen the following new(?) date formats: dd.MMM.yyyy dd.mm.yyyy Seems gc.com introduced '.' as separator as well. At least four users gave feedback, that they were actually using one of these but did not actively change to that. So might be, that they changed some defaults based on whatever rule. Shall we do anything for that? dd.MMM.yyyy should be detectable and usable, but dd.mm.yyyy is not usable I think (due to the existing mm.dd.yyyy)

		According to this information: http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=323369 The following was reverted: We've also reverted the change from &quot;Unknown&quot; to &quot;Mystery&quot; in GPX files, meaning that &quot;?&quot; caches will display and filter properly in those applications and devices that could not handle the terminology change. Do we need to fix the import or are we running backward compatability?

		The menu of the stored lists can be optimized. We should differ between select mode and normal mode. I would prefer to have the menu items for selected items right at the main menu instead of a manage submenu. Others can be removed in select mode like show on map, delete list, rename list, new list (can create one on move selected). What do you think? What's written in the actionbar specs?

As my SGS3 was OK with the same build I guess we have the same problem now with one higher resolution step. Remark; For the SGS3 it was solved with this commit: a0566f5

		When geocaching I often use an external GPS receiver (in my case a BT-359) to improve my tablets battery life and have better positioning results. Using the 'mock locations setting' and a bluetooth GPS provider (like: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=googoo.android.btgps ) this is doable but has a number of drawbacks. I'm not sure if the 'mock locations' setting is available for everyone. some apps do not allow 'location spoofing' which they equate to having set the 'use mock locations' setting to true. the system works when the bluetooth gps provider replaces the internal GPS, which confuses a lot of other apps apparently. i'm not sure what is happening with the other internal location providers (network, gsm) when the internal gps is replaced by the bluetooth provider, but I'd like these things to be undisturbed if possible. Ideal situation: Let the bluetooth gps provider create a new location provider instead of replacing the gps (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globalsat.android.gps.bluetooth.provider claims to support both these methods ) Have a setting in cgeo where I can select which gps provider to use. (Walhalla: have cgeo use multiple providers) I understand this is far from trivial to implement. Questions: Is there an alternative which gives me roughly the same results? What would need to be done to implement this? For example: would the implementation be able to borrow from existing implementations or would I have to start from scratch? Are other people interested in this?

		Having used this fantastic app on about 5 different android phones, it seems there is some issue with the compass on the Nexus 5. I have a number of other apps that use the compass, and they give correct and consistent readings. I find that, in particular, when far away from the coords, say 20+ meters, cgeo's compass just isn't working.

		Currently using 2014.07.03-NB-46e90fc From the map view, there is an option to select Navigate, but nothing happens. From a cache, the Navigate option is not available. I find this feature very useful, and use it often when driving between caches.

		I was just trying to fix #4036 by just making the URL part of the regex more tolerant. That worked fine, but afterwards by emulator was hanging for eternity when trying to download the avatar image. I guess this is because of the toBlocking() in HtmlImage.getDrawable(). Generally speaking, right now the image CDN of GC.com is somewhat broken as it seems (it creates direct links instead of using the CDN, and the https links deliver http traffic). Nevertheless we should not have such blocking calls with a time limit.

		As oc.uk also supports OKAPI we can easily extend c:geo to cover this site as well. The implementation is already ready, it is just necessary to acquire official keys (http://www.opencaching.org.uk/okapi/signup.html) and add them to the build environment.

		For starting the log activity for caches we use a &quot;pencil&quot; icon, which IMO reflects the usage quite good. However when opening a TB the log activity has a different icon. This should be replaced by the &quot;pencil&quot; icon as well.

		If debug mode is active the live-map header includes debug information like coords, loading strategy, zoom level requested. Due to the fact, that the available space has shortened since introduction of the actionbar it would be helpful for testing if this debug strings can be shortened or placed elsewhere, because currently the most important part is not readable anymore. Minimum solution IMO would be to just ommit the lat/lon information. Another solution would be to have the information available in some submenu. Optimum solution would be to have it in a footer row below the map or as a small overlay on the map.

		I have a feature request that I think many users are missing. As a die-hard FTF hunter it would really be great to be able to see how many that are having a cache on their watchlist. Many FTF hunters tend to place newly published caches on watchlist to be notified via email if/when the race is lost. The text in the Watchlist section might read &quot;Cache is on your watchlist (7 in total)&quot; or &quot;Cache is not on your watchlist (7 in total)&quot;

			<description>
		Been running the latest nightly builds for som time now and there's one annoying bug with the ones I've used this week. The history doesn't contain all the offline logs resulting in missing found logs when exporting the feild notes. I noticed this the first time July 16th and it's the same today. All caches are saved and updated on the phone prior to caching. The offline logs are saved and I'm able to open the logs from the individual caches, but they simply don't appear in the history. Today 2 of the caches are not shown, last time it was 3 or 4. Currently running 2014-07-18-NB1-0822830 and can confirm that the bug is still there.

		Recently when I try to filter caches in a certain city or place or try to find caches nearby, the number of caches is limited to 40. Although the button at the bottom states &quot;more caches (at this moment 40)&quot;. When I click this button, it still shows the same 40 caches and no more. Where I used to be able to get more than 40 caches. I am wondering why this feature is not working anymore. Hope to hear a solution from you Ray

		There is currently only one posting on FB mentioning that there is something wrong with TB loading for those user previously affected by #4082. I can neither reproduce nor I am sure, that this is an issue. Still I remember #3118, where the manipulated HTML issue came up for the first time. Will try to investigate if this is an issue or not.

		Too often I see incorrect log types in a cache page and I realized it often is due to c:geo having a default log type - &quot;Found it&quot; on caches not your own. I think the app ought to force the user to select the log type before it can be submitted instead of having a default.

Google claims this API has been deprecated and one cannot obtain the key: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/v1/mapkey?csw=1 . What should I do? Are there any public-ish keys? It's not really an issue with the app, but I wasn't sure where to ask this question. I think anyone new to the dev team will have this problem.

		Extract of todays IRC-chat: [19:12] Lineflyer: OneEyed.. a question or proposal: From what I can see/test in our nightly builds c:geo is rather stable at the moment.... Now I see over the last days that a lot of refactorings are going on which is a good thing but (from testers perspective) possibly endangers the stability or at least need another round of testing. So doesn't it make sense to release from master NOW despite the open issues? Or might there be another possiblity to have a fairly good tested version? [19:12] Lineflyer: Maybe another branch? But this makes things more complicated...wouldn't it? [19:12] OneEyed: Well, yes, it would complicate things, and moreover, nothing would ever be tested anymore [19:14] OneEyed: We should branch release from before todays refactorings [19:15] OneEyed: Those refactorings are here to allow an easier map rewrite, + an easier integration of Google Services location providers [19:38] Lineflyer: oneeyed... branching release as of yesterday would be a good idea (from my perspective). Of course, we would throw away the possibility to do a quick fix in case of website changes.....but I think if such thing happens, it would be good as it forces us to do a step forward Opinions on that?

		With the new action bar we have two different meanings for the same icon: https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/blob/master/main/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_menu_mapmode.png First usage: On live map for selecting the map source Second usage: In cache details for selecting a navigation method. I think we should find another icon for the second usage (on cache details) because the world map does not reflect that the navigation is triggered here. I suggest another slightly modified compass rose icon or simply the letters &quot;NAV&quot; as an icon.

		While showing the new actionbar to some users and giving out the NB to some others, I often got the feedback that finding the way to send a log is not intuitive. This is how it currently looks on standard mobile phones: I think it would be desireable if the send button would always show up with text like mocked here and the remaining items always go to the overflow:

		I wish to have a mode, where c:geo shows every cache one or more members of the current group did not find yet. The Problem ist, you often go caching with a group of people which do not have found the same caches, but only one or two are using there devices, to save battery. Sometimes you walk past a cache some members would like to log, but nobody knows there is a cache they need. Maybe you can &quot;connect&quot; accounts by scanning a QR-Code from another device and c:geo only hides the finds of all members currently connected. It would be an awesome feature of an already great app!

		It would enable a new way to use the app if it would periodically check the approximate position of the device and check if a saved cache is within a given range (like 100m) and show a notification. Also it would be great if one could set filters (like only show traditional caches) and enable/disable this feature. For better battery life, an additional mode would only check the (GPS) position if it is being activated by another app.

		Hi there, this is my first bug report, so please be kind. ;) But seriously, I have not been able to find neither a solution but nor someone else with the same problem, so I don't know whether it really is a bug. c:geo does not find the maps that I have moved to the sd-card. They are found when I place them on the internal storage (which is called sdcard0), but not on sdcard1 (actual sd-card), even when I specifiy the exact directory. I'm using a Huawei MediaPad 7 Youth (S7-701u) with Android 4.1.2. Thanks for your answers!

		Before the implementation of the actionbar the user activated the feature by selecting &quot;Start Speech&quot; in the menu. This menu option then changed to &quot;Stop Speech&quot; and was implicitly indicating whether speeach is currently active or not. With the actionbar the functionality is basically the same but the user would need to long press the icon each time to find out whether talking is enabled or disabled. I failed today several times in checking and changing the status and got confused by pressing the icon without anything happening. It would be preferable if there is some visual feedback to the user by one of these methods: Show a toast &quot;Speech activated&quot; / &quot;Speeach deactivated&quot; after each press Have a permanent status indicator on the compass screen itself Change the icon in the actionbar reflecting the next action (e.g. Stop talking would be a strikethrough bubble)

		So you're geocaching in a public place and people are staring at you. We geocache in groups from 2 to 3 so we're thinking it might be funny if the compass had a button we would could press to play a sound bite event such as the tricoder sound. Not to the extent of having a LCARS theme but something comical when we're the dead centre of attention. Tricoder sound example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_LV_mUd14

		I just had an ANR in CacheListActivity. I opened a pocket query ZIP file from the launcher and selected c:geo. The app opened, but nothing happened afterwards. This is in a location, where I normally only get a GPS fix after quite some time. I run a one or two days old build with enabled Play service location provider. My feeling is this could be a &quot;block until GPS is ready&quot; issue again.

		Before introduction of the new location provider it was possible to see the reliability of the location in the lower right corner (GPS or network). Now it is always fused and you don't know if the position is from network with possibly high precision but low correctness or from GPS with the given accuracy.

		If no gcvote rating is present, the favorite rectangle on the lists do have a black border (1dp) on the white theme. However if a rating is present (background is green/orange/red) the border is missing. I do not see why this is the case, because the border color is defined. Probably another appearance of the confusing alpha values in the ARGB color definitions. Will try investigate this.

		When navigating to one of the additional waypoints of a cache (e.g. stages of a multicache), the cache itself is displayed on the map instead of the selected waypoint. When trying to navigate to that waypoint again, it works. Steps to reproduce: open a cache with multiple waypoints go to the left-most screen (list of waypoints) select a waypoint (e.g. a station of a multi-cache) so that you get the context menu select Navigate select Map Current result: main icon of that cache is displayed (on its correct location) Expected result: selected waypoint should be displayed on the map Workaround: go back to the waypoint list repeat the steps Notes: seems to be timing related on slower devices the problem only happens occasionally

		For easier debugging it would be helpful to get c:geo compiled with a different applicationId so that the debug instance run be installed / run / debugged without having to de-install the existing installation (with all of its cached data, configurations, ...). Changing the package name in main/AndroidManifest.xml -    package=&quot;cgeo.geocaching&quot;
+    package=&quot;cgeo.geocaching.test&quot;
 causes lots of compilation errors: ~/Projects/cgeo&gt; ./gradlew assembleDebug

		Recently we disabled Samsung multi window support as there seems to be a memory leak in some versions of Samsungs multi window feature leading to crashes when continously rotating the device while c:geo live map with mapsforge offline map is active. There was a discussion in Munich whether or not we should reenable this feature. I vote for reanabling because: It would be a feature regression if we release without that function. I know some people regularly using it (e.g. gallery and c:geo in multi window for typing in coords from pictures they took) Only a subset of devices seem to be affected (my S3 (Android 4.3) is affected, my Samsung S4 (Android 4.4.2) and my Galaxy Note 10.1 (Android 4.3) are not affected) The OOM seems only to happen when using mapsforge in combination with continous rotation (in combination with an affected device). It could be a rare case anyway. Opinions? I will meanwhile test if other apps supporting it have similar problems on my S3 (e.g. Locus).

		I experienced, that on the trackable logging page (but might be the same on the cache logging page) the log button might be missing in the actionbar (see screenshot). I assume that the network connection was bad and thus the log page was not yet being loaded from gc.com. Before we implemented the actionbar this was indicated by the send button being replaced with a &quot;Loading Log Page&quot; button. With the current implementation there is no visual indication to the user that he can not yet send his log. I suggest to always show the send button and if the user presses the send button while page loading has not yet been completed, to show a toast with an error message like &quot;c:geo is still loading data from the server. Please try again in some seconds&quot;.

		Google recently changed the PlayStore appearance (via playstore app): They introduced a short description and are now using the &quot;Advertisement image&quot; as heading image after selecting the app. I already filled the short description with the former first line of our long description (c:geo ~ Let's find some geocaches!) in all available languages. However the &quot;advertisement image&quot; we currently have is somehow outdated and looks not so very advertising IMO. Is someone here able and willing to rework/replace it by something different? It is stored here in our repo: https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/blob/master/main/project/rawimages/play_feature_graphic.jpg Current appearance (without the short description I already added):

		I have recently noticed multiple instances of following feature: I'm in GMT +02 timezone (Helsinki). I have this timezone setting both in my phone and in geocaching.com (just checked). If I submit a new log (i.e. Cache found) before 10 am Finnish time, using &quot;Today&quot; as submission date, the log will show with the previous date in geocaching.com. I.e. today 21.8. I submitted online two cache visits between 9 and 10 a.m. from my Android phone using c:geo. When reviewing these logs with my computer, I find out that both instances have been saved in geocaching.com with date 20.8. This has happened before, also i.e. with a morning meet log. It seems that somewhere in the chain the time stamps are not handled correctly. I have also reported this problem to geocaching.com, since I've learned that similar problem occurs also with some other online software, at least neongeo.

		When using the app on Samsung Galaxy Note 2, you open the compass to direct you to the cahe coordinates, it remains static. Distance to coords changes, gps position moves as expected, but compass doesnt move or is jumpy and then freezes. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled to no effect. This was working perfectly up until a day ago.

		We use enumerations when invoking activities via intent. E.g. the CacheListActivity gets a CacheListType enum to behave differently as history or offline list. This is all fine, as long as the intents are handled only inside our app. I've started enhancing the shortcut creation abilities of c:geo and this is a problem now. We cannot invoke any activity (from outside) that uses such custom types in its intent, as the launcher application is not able to load the necessary enumeration classes (due to them being in our package). I'm thinking of how to replace the enums in the intents, such that it remains maintainable and readable. I'm currently favoring to use the string representation of the enum values (and not the ordinal values), as that would be more readable for external intent callers. Any other opinions?

		Put the phone into a stable position (e.g. I have in my desk charger). Open the compass from a cache. It will point north and not change. Only if you move the phone or if you change the used sensors via menu, then the display is updated.

I am sure this started with that version as the version from 17.08.14 worked well. I performed a fallback to a version of early August which is working fine. Samsung Galaxy S4 with CM 10.2 Could that be the date (did not check) where Google Play services have been introduced?

		I'm not using live map much, but today I watched a friend, who never used our app before. He was coming from live map (with a big area covered), looked at a cache and zoomed into the map of that cache very closely. When going back to the live map, it was also zoomed in closely. We should use 2 different persistent zoom states to allow more easy switching between these 2 use cases.

They make PQ, download it, import it and then &quot;refresh all&quot; as PQ just does not contains all the informations a normal cacher needs in c:geo. The request is. Have an option to directly download all caches from PQ reader. Not just 20 at the time.

		At least on Android 4.x, people sometimes complain that the network is not used to get an approximate location. In their phone settings, they might use &quot;device only&quot; while they should select &quot;high precision&quot; if they want to use the network location provider. This would need a FAQ entry.

 The is probably due to the external assignment of the listener field in EditNoteDialog.newInstance, since after a rotation the dialog will be recreated with a null listener.

		I wonder if we should reintroduce the &quot;Set destination&quot; menu in the compass. While reworking the menus it was removed for some reason(?) but people on support and on FB keep asking for that. It seems to be more often used than we have thought as people don't want to go back and add waypoints but just continue from one navigation to another by settings a new destination directly in the compass.

After some mails back and forth it turned out that they did not manage to get the clue, that the OK button is behind the keyboard in that showcase screen.

		Right now, Settings.migrateSettings() is called if the right version is not found. However, in the absence of settings (for example in a fresh installation), this method is called and for integer settings install settings that might be different than the default found in the corresponding setter. This led to #3723 because the default was present in two places. We should avoid callling migrateSettings if no previous settings are present, for example by checking for the presence of a known key which had always been there, or by checking (if possible) for the presence of those shared preferences.

		We have one loader (RemoveHistoryLoader), which actually executes a database modifying operation before loading data. At least to me this concept seems rather wrong. That operation should be done independent of the loader, and this loader class be removed completely. Or am I missing something? (stumbled over this looking at #4251 and where we already use confirmation dialogs)

		In Menu / Utility / Locus there is is this description Simple, usable application which shows online maps and allows you to download them directly into Offline mode (raster maps only). Also supports track recording, POI handling and many other useful functions. I know Locus and it is quite complex, not simple. In Locus you can work with offline vector maps as well. I suggest to change the description to Usable application which shows online and offline maps and allows you to download them directly into Offline mode (online raster maps only). Also supports track recording, POI handling and many other useful functions.

		Funny fact or bug? Version: 2014.09.02 If I change the phone language the showcase view is shown again for all three views, where we implemented it. I wonder if this is just a small bug in the showcase code or anything triggered by our code (forgetting settings,etc.). However it is nice for testing purposes.

		If GeoKrety (as of geolutins, pathtags...) are supported by c:geo, it would be good if they could be easily differentiated in cache inventory. Adding an icon representing &quot;brand&quot; may be an option. What's your opinion?

		It might have seemed &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;fancy&quot; to have a transparent main screen at some point in the past, but now it brings nothing to the application and looks strange compared to what people are used to. Therefore, I propose to use a unified black or white background depending on the color scheme. Opinions?

Google says we need to add one more configuration change &quot;screenSize&quot;: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6968105/orientation-change-in-honeycomb Might be relevant for other activities too.

		Right now we are showing the type icon (e.g. the orange multi cache icon) in the cache details activity only. It should be shown in every activity that is related to exactly one cache, instead of the default c:geo icon. Technically, we should have higher resolution icons for the cache types, when implementing this (or upscale the current icons from their native resolution). Other opinions?

		Since one of the last updates (I'm using the nightlies), quite possibly since c:geo uses Google Play Services, localization with switched-off GPS places my Live Map in France (centred on Paris, Ile-de-France). Whenever I restart c:geo, it's centred there again. Any ideas why? BTW: no Google account on this phone, does that matter?

		The current implementation for viewing a GeoKrety trackable use the API brought by GK team. We use export2.php script to retrieve data. Currently we can get: gkid tracking code (when authenticated request) distance traveled lat/long current waypoint owner_id state type featured image and name missing details, like: current goal pictures gallery rate detailed logs visited countries count watching users count place visited reported missing info and maybe more... On the IRC we told &quot;no more html parsing&quot;... It would be cool if the GK webmasters can provide more info or API to retrieve those informations. I can send them an email, proposing to discuss about that here.

		Since we are using crowdin, we experience more wrong placeholders (%d, %s), missing/bad special characters and similar than when we still got translations as pull requests. The build script should flag the build as unstable in case of translation errors (with non matching placeholders at least), as those could potentially crash the app.

		After 3ff011f has been implemented (very nice feature btw) I recognized an case at this weekend: GC27W1Y It is a multi with a predefined WP for stage 1 named Station 1 (as stage 1 is always at the listing coords but sometimes separately listed by the owner) After solving stage 1 I entered a new WP and it was autonamed Stage of a multi cache 1 but should be Stage of a multi cache 2 This is probably hard to solve automatically as the initial waypoint can have random names. I renamed the new WP Stage of a multi cache 1 manually to Stage of a multi cache 2 and saved it Afterwards I again created a new WP to enter the coords of the third stage. Now the autofill gives me 'Stage of a multi cache 1' again although Stage of a multi cache 2 already exists. Here we should not only look up whether Stage of a multi cache 1 is existing but also if other Stage of a multi cache x are existing and create Stage of a multi cache (x+1) in this case.

		I checked the code how connectors are working. From an developers point of view it is not too bad. But it is static limited. What about an dynamic system ? Pack each Adapter into an DEX file Dynamic load DEX file's from an location Allow user to add new connectors This would allow to build new connectors more easy. You can provide &quot;binary&quot; plugins for GC-API without disclosure of the source. Less dependencies in the project.

		From support mail: Right now I have to first log the cache and afterwards add it to my favorites on another page of c:geo. It would be better to have the option to add it, right on the logging screen like it is realized on the website (and in c:geo for voting on gcvote). It somehow makes sense, to decide about favoriting the cache while logging it, rather than having to do it manually afterwards.

		c:geo has a major problem handling lists: it cannot handle a cache existing in 2 lists. Scenario: Have file1.gpx contain caches A, B, C. Import that file in list1. Have file2.gpx contain caches A, B, C, D, E, F. Import that file in list2. Expected result would be each list to contain the corresponding caches from the imported files. Actual result is: list2 contains A, B, C, D, E, F; list1 is empty. The fundaments of having lists, in principle, suggests the ability to manage different sets of caches, which have the potential to partially overlap. In the above example I may also have specific reasons to have A, B, C caches in list1, while at the same time have them in list2 which holds another set for different reasons. Considering the current implementation, implementing independent list handling will require implementing a migration module for the data stored as subfolders for each cache.

		This may be related to the map scale issue. My list of caches, sorted by proximity, jumps wildly. I have a cache at 149m, then after a few seconds I see it at 3.26km, then again at 149m... GPS fix is stable, position icon on map is stable. GPS fix on map in other apps is stable. Position in GPS status app is stable. I am connected to internet via wifi, I have GSM off. The same happens with GSM+WiFi all off, or with all on. At first it may seem like jumps between coarse and fine location, but in airplane mode there is no coarse location provider (eg. GSM tower)

		Current list management is IMO incomplete. Consider offline mode. There are several lists of stored caches. Considering a reasonably dense population of caches, I want to see on the map only members of my choice of lists. Currently one can see all caches, or only caches of a single list (via list -&gt; show on map). I am requesting the addition of a &quot;visibility&quot; flag to each list, and only visible lists be shown on map, such that I can display more then one list, but less then all lists.

		I have a list of 324 caches. Some of them also have supplemental data stored in folders under .cgeo. Assume I do a &quot;remove all&quot;. Now c:geo no longer has them stored. Problem 1: I am offline yet I still see all the caches I just removed on the map. Caching some of the data is ok, but I really want to get rid of them. See them gone. What do I have to do, other then manually deleting all files under .cgeo? Problem 2: all per cache folders under .cgeo are still there. They occupy storage space. I don't want them anymore. I removed the caches from storage, I want all their data gone. After managing several imports and them removed them, I was left with 3000 folders and several GB of space blocked this way. Problem 3: while online I consulted several caches in the area (via the map). Stored several of interest, left the rest. Now I go offline. I still see all caches that c:geo showed while online on the map. While caching them for some people may be of interest, I am only interested in the ones I stored, the rest are now cluttering the map. I cannot get rid of them unless I manually delete all files under .cgeo. The hard to access deep in the settings &quot;delete orphaned files&quot; command does not help with either of these problems.

		This one is from support email: If a link on picture is done using area tag and not a href links in c:geo does not work. Example caches are GC2B09B (hyperlink on the pic) and GC4ZR3R (maplink on the compass). Shall we do anything or it's too excotic?

		Running C:Geo on my Nexus 7 Gen 1 and Nexus 7 Gen 2, OS version 4.4.4 In Liveview the icons load on the Gen 1 but are only displayed as generic icons (double question marks) until I click on them. The Gen 2 however display the correct icons at once. Regards Hans Blom

		In cache details we hide the size for earth caches. In the map popup we wrongly show it. When fixing this, make sure the same condition is used. I guess we hide it for all virtual caches.

		Hi, I have the problem that caches won't be shown as &quot;found&quot; on the map which I found for a long time (e.g. GC32NGW). On the geocaching website the cache will be shown as found. But in c:geo it won't be neither on the map nor in the cache details. Maybe I also find the reason for the issue. I have found that not all cache logs will be loaded, also if you scroll down to the end of the list. The first cache log which I can see is from the 17.04.2014, but I found the cache one year earlier (15.04.2013). I hope you can reproduce the issue. greetings Shorty

		When invoking the translation menu on an encoded hint the result is just garbage. We should make the cache details creator set explicit ids for each line (which must be defined in ids.XML) instead of using id.value everywhere. When we have explicit ids for each line then we can easily take the necessary string from the cache member fields instead of reading it from the text controls.

		I just found a bug in the latest version ( unsure if it existed before though ) . It's quite easy to reproduce . I open a cache that has a &quot;Parking&quot; waypoint I then go to the waypoints page and click on the compass icon on the right next to the parking waypoint Everything fine till here , it shows the correct coordinates above the compass :) I then click on the map Icon on top , and here comes the problem ... It will show me the Cache location on the map , not the parking location ( it uses the cache icon too instead of the parking icon ) If you exit the map and re-click on the map icon , it's ok , Parking icon on correct spot As strange as it is , the problem only occurs the first time after opening the cache , it's fine afterwards . To recreate the error , close the cache , reopen it , and it will happen again .. The same thing happens if I hold my finger on the Parking Waypoint, then select &quot;navigate&quot; , &quot;map&quot; The first time after opening the cache , it will show the Cache location with the cache icon on the map an navigate to it ... Exiting the map an redoing exactly the same thing will result in parking being displayed correctly . Cgeo Version 2014.09.18 Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Android 4.2.2

		For mystery and multi caches it is possible to change the cache coordinates. E.g. after I've solved a mystery, I set the coordinates of the cache to the coordinates of the final. This allows me to see on the maps the place I need to walk to. For traditional caches this is not possible. This is correct, as the cache location is the place I will visit. For WherIGo caches it is not possible as well. Usually I will start at the given coordinates. But especially in the case of Play-Anywhere-WherIGos, I'm getting the coordinates of a final box during the game. Now I would be happy if I can set the coordinates of the cache. I'll be happy if you implement this change. btw: Thanks a lot for your work and keep on hacking

		Since version 2014-09-18 the compass points in seemingly arbitrary directions. This affects navigation as well as the stored cache list. I have only been caching (or trying to) twice since then. In one instance it pointed roughly in the opposite direction of the supposed cache location (judging from distance displayed) over the course of several minutes moving around on foot. In the other instance it pointed consistently about 90° westwards of a known cache location while i was moving 1,5 kilometers on a bike.

		Hi, I often hunt caches is Prague and here is cache density very big so sometimes it's difficult for c:geo to show all caches on area about 2x3km, even harder it is for geocacher to select particular cache on map like that. I recommend that map overlay should merge icons which are too close in one special icon and if that icon will be clicked it should show menu/list where you can select which one cache/waypoint you need. It should also help the readability of map. What do you think about this ? TriakCZ

		I created child waypoints in GSAK, and then export as a GPX file to Dropbox, and then import into c.geo. However, the child waypoints don't show up as additional waypoints. If I import the GPX file to another program on my PC, or even if I import the file to Locus, the child waypoints are correctly shown. So only c.geo is not importing them correctly. My preferred app is c.geo, so hoping you have a fix. Thx

		When I'm logging multiple trackables, then I sometimes want to repeat the log text. But typically I forget to copy it into the clipboard, while I'm logging the first one. I suggest to have a menu item &quot;Last log text&quot; either on the top level or behind the &quot;Insert&quot; menu item, which automatically puts the last used log text into the text field. Anyone with different ideas or related use cases?

		I connect via WiFi and search a cache by geo code. Ex: GC1VR4M I load the details and have a message saying: &quot;Not available offline&quot; and store the cache. After disconnecting, I go to the stored cache and don't have the button to show compass, only to log. If I search through the live map, I'm able to go to the compass. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks in advance

		Today I was out caching with 2014.10.09-NB and had the following problem, which I try to describe: Low power mode activated in c:geo I started at home where I had Wifi active in my home network I drove 35km to the cache location Activated the live map The initial position before GPS fix is accquired is still &quot;at home&quot; making the position jump 35km forth and back on each standby and resume of the map Most probably the location provider had no better information, so it took the last available approximated position until the fix is done. What I don't understand is, that this happens repeatedly altough after the first fix the location provider should rather assume that I am on the last known position. Is this a problem/behaviour of the Google Service or can we do anything about that. I never experienced this &quot;problem&quot; in c:geo versions without Google Location Service.

		I was using send2cgeo since a while, with everything working perfectly. Then I discovered I could have the site in english... and that half-broke send2cgeo: I still have the &quot;send to c:geo&quot; in each cache page, but not anymore on the short description mini-page when I click on a cache on the map. I also checked that going back to english fixes the problem, and going to german makes it reappear, so it's really an i18n issue.

		After implementation of #3799 it is most likely (depending on the screensize) that the &quot;Done&quot; button is now hidden behind the keyboard. So for the normal operation of entering coords and closing the window, the user might need an additional keypress to close the keyboard now. I suggest to place the &quot;Done&quot; button at the first position as this is probably the most used operation on this screen.

		Recently gc.com changed the content of http://www.geocaching.com/account/ManagePreferences.aspx which is used in the login process of c:geo. It is now forwarded to https://www.geocaching.com/myaccount/settings/preferences with a new UI. I tested that the date format seems still to be detected correct, but I did not test all possible formats (so I am not 100% sure). Additionally I don't know what else other information we retrieve from the mentioned URL. Please notice that now also HTTPS is used. Can someone confirm that all is working normal at this point?

		I just imported a cache from mail on my tablet in landscape mode. During the import 2 pencils were visible in the action bar, after the import one of them vanished. Conclusion: In all actions that take more than a tiny amount of time to initialize we should disable optional actions by default (instead of declaring them visible in the XML and then hiding them in the code).

		Hi, I have a crash that can be reproduced (at least on my phone). Running 18/9/2014 (latest from playstore) on Galaxy S3 Cyanogenmod 11 M11. I tried https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/wiki/Send-log-to-developers but it doesn't generate any log output. Just some few lines about an activity starting: --------- beginning of /dev/log/main
I/Timeline( 5904): Timeline: Activity_idle id: android.os.BinderProxy@41c450a8 time:375560
W/InputEventReceiver( 5904): Attempted to finish an input event but the input event receiver has already been disposed.
I/Timeline( 5904): Timeline: Activity_idle id: android.os.BinderProxy@41e248b0 time:405629
I/Timeline( 5904): Timeline: Activity_idle id: android.os.BinderProxy@41e248b0 time:416735
I/Timeline( 5904): Timeline: Activity_idle id: android.os.BinderProxy@41e248b0 time:739101
 If I go to /dev/log to see what's in the logs, there are only empty files there. The google crash report does show the stacktrace nicely, but it seems impossible to store this report somewhere? To reproduce I do the following: Open a pocket query in c:geo with more than 20 caches in result. First 20 are showing. Apply filter: Status=Not Stored. Observe less than 20 result remaining, for example 19. Select Store Offline from menu. Select create new list. Observe crash after a few seconds. There's an IndexOutOfBoundsException in CacheListActivity.java:286. Please note that when I rerun the scenario above, there are less than 19 caches not stored. For example 16. Next run: 14 not stored, etc. So it does store some caches before crashing. It does not show any progress in the bar before crashing. So maybe it tries to update the progress bar and crashes? If I try the exact same pocket query with no filter, I can store it fine. I tried with different pocket queries, so it looks like it doesn't matter which pocket query I use. Anything else I can provide?

		I have one saved solved mystery (in a list) where i set the calculated final WP coordinate as new cache coordinate, locally and on the web site. When doing a search for nearby caches, i see the cache listed with (and sorted by) the distance to the publish coordinates, not the new saved coordinates. When i go to the cache details, i see the correct (bigger) distance to the final. When returning to the list of nearby caches, now that cache is listed with and sorted by the correct (bigger) distance. This can be reproduced by closing the list of nearby caches and opening it again. I expect to see the distance to the cache to be correct upfront. Version: 2014.10.28-NB-935444e

		While reading #4441 I remembered a similar issue on the live map which I experienced with 2014.10.25-NB: Have some caches with modified coords saved in c:geo Open the live map of this location (it might be important for this issue, that the listing coords and the modified coords are both within the map view) While the live map is loading the solved mytery are already shown at their modified coords (including the flagpost overlay icon) as it should be After loading it might happen (but not always) that the solved mystery jumps to the listing coords (but still showing the flagpost overlay) This situation can be corrected by moving or zooming the map which makes the caches jump back to their modified coords @samueltardieu As you are assigned to #4441 maybe you can take a look at this one as well. I assume the wrong positioning comes from a similar source = The nearby search performed during live map loading

		Today I attended an event, where a user showed me the following crash scenario on his Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (running Android 4.4.2) with c:geo version 2014.09.18: Open live map using OSM:Offline map Rotate 3 times On fourth rotation c:geo crashes The specific play report shows only this: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

 This can not be the multiwindow bug as it should be disabled in that version. I can contact the user. What else would we need to find the reason? Possibly a memory dump...but AFAIR this is not automatically created in the release version isn't it?

		When showing cache details and swiping to the logbook page, some recent logs are shown. The name of the logger, the logtype (e.g. found it, didn't find it) and the number of found caches are shown with the logtext, but I am also interested in the log dates. Was the cache found recently, was the cache found every day or only once a month. When showing the dates this gives you more information about that.

		Hi! There are some caches, that have really long names and are part of the trail (eg.: A really, really long cache name that is part of this beautifull trail No. 11). In a list of all saved caches c:geo only shows first XY characters (I have a small phone screen). Since the cache number is usually on the end, I can not find a specific cache easily. If I sort by name I have to count where the desired one will be, that is quite hard. The proximity sort is also of no use in some cases, when the trail is circular and the returning path is nearing the curent one, so the closest caches are not always the next ones. I wish there was an option to have multi-line title names, to switch them on and off. Is that possible to implement? Regards; Luka

		Hello! I have searched but could not find an option to show on a list of saved caches only those that I have not found yet. During caching I usually save only offline status (found it, DNF, ...) and send log only when I came home. But there is no filter to show only the saved caches without saved log. There is an option to show caches that have saved log, but I wan't right the oposite. Is this possible to implement? Regards; Luka

		Since this Version, my phone (Samsung Galaxy GT-S7562 Android 4.0.4 Kernel 3.0.8-1102401) performes a shut down (complete power off) while loading detailed cache information from live map. The last version before this c:geo update was working perfekt without any error. This bug causes the phone to shut off (power) complete. In order to restart the phone, you have to remove the battery and wait for some time before you put it back in. I try to provide a crash dump, but since the device is going down complete, it is not easy to do.

		Some days ago I complied a RC version via Jenkins. I have used that version during the last weekend on three devices and it performed good. IMHO we can release this version to have some bugs fixed in the field (including the important fix to support all possible date formats): · Fix: Map icons looked blurred on some devices\n
· Fix: Some menus had a wrong font size\n
· Fix: Adding an event to calendar was not always working\n
· Fix: Do not show cache size info for earth caches as it has none\n
· Fix: Support all possible date formats of geocaching.com\n
· Fix: Avoid crash when saving a filtered list of caches\n
· Fix: Picture title in TB logs not shown\n
 Are we good to go or do you think there is something missing (open issues, or changes currently only on master)? Maybe some new translations pending?

		As the login error message on gc.com changed we currenlty always report &quot;Unknown error&quot;. Seems they now alway report Either your username or password is incorrect. Please try again. If you've forgotten your information, click here.
 So we might now be unable to distinguish between username or password failure and should always probably give the same message as above.

		From support mail: I user is missing the button for adding a cache to his favorites. He send along a screenshot which seems to confirm, that the whole favorite line is missing. Login is checked OK, all other functions normal. Any idea? I asked him to crosscheck another device and another user on his device. Waiting for answer. To only &quot;unusual&quot; thing I noticed up to now is, that the user has a 5-digit find count. Might this influence the parsing at that point?

		Hi, If I am not mistaken, currently the Google Maps integration in c:geo does not cache map tiles? I know I can use OSM maps to have offline maps, but these have some points that could be considered sub-optimal: You have to either store complete countries in your phone, or create your own maps for the areas you need. For example the map for Germany is 1.3GB. In some countries Google Maps is just a lot better compared to OSM. Would you consider implementing support for the caching of Google Maps tiles? By caching I mean caching them for a couple of day or so. I think the Google Maps API v2 (#2222) supports storing tiles offline and allows to keep tiles stored for up to 30 days? In a perfect world, we would be using the offline storage of the official Android Google Maps app. This app can store maps offline in a convenient way: all zoom levels are stored. So when preparing for a trip, or for areas you frequently visit, you keep the maps stored offline in Google Maps. If c:geo could use this, it would be very helpful. I've tried to google whether this is possible, but couldn't really find any info on it. I would be willing to help on the implementation, but first we need to agree on whether it's a desired feature, etc. Opper

		From support mail: Currently there seems to be no offline tool which supports the Dutch RD coordinate system. In the netherlands quite some caches use this. It would be good if c:geo would also support entering coords in Dutch RD. Maybe someone come along willing to implement it. IMHO its a rare case....but I had the same problem while staying in dutch and can confirm that I did not find any tool supporting it offline on Android.

		Three users reported this via support mail: Version: 2014.11.04 All users are PM Have a list of offline saved caches Refresh the list of caches After refresh some caches are missing the size info in the list view as well as in the details (line is missing) Doing another refresh either solves the problem or other random caches loose the size info One user reported, that after a fresh reboot of the device (probably a fresh start of c:geo would be enough) the problem disappears for some time to happen again after some hours. With current master I can not reproduce this. I will test the market version later and report back.

		In detail view, date when cache was found is displayed after the status &quot;found&quot;. This must be rather new feature, i guess, i never noticed that before. Anyway, when logging a cache from c:geo one day later, setting the date to „yesterday“, the date shown after the cache status is today, not „yesterday“. So caches found 8th of november but logged on 9th of november with log date „yesterday“ are displayed as found on 9th of november. Interestingly enough, gc.com has a similar bug: I logged my first cache from Saarland one day late and manually set the date to one day before. Cache found date is correct, but the date i aquired the Saarland souvenir is wrong, it's the date i entered the log. But that is unrelated. I forgot: Nightly 2014-11-10-NB1-e0afb7

		I have downloaded OSM mapping to a file on my phone and selected the correct path. Help informatin states the following - In order for c:geo to use the selected map you have to activate OSM:Offline in the dropdown menu &quot;Select Map Source&quot; located above the directory settings. You can change this setting also directly from live map.- The dropdown menu referred to does not contain &quot;OSM:Offline&quot; as an option. I am using version 2014.11.04

		I have no meaning yet about that, thus I want to share it with you to get feedback. From support mail: I'd like to share an idea for an update. When caches are in a list view ( near caches, saved caches) actually you can see :name, code, dimensions, D, T and distance. I think, it could be useful another row, where is listed last log info (date, log type, log user). This could be useful:in this way you can check at first sight situation of many caches at once. Instead to open each one. Hope that explain it clearly. Thanks for your work.

		Way to generate the bug: select a cache on the map cklick on more details --&gt; move to the waypointlist click on the compass icon on the right sight of a waypoint in the waypointlist of a cache click on the mapicon --&gt; map opens map is centered on the waypoint location but the red icon is invisible; the main icon is the only one which is visable on the map go back to the compass view click on the mapicon --&gt; map opens map is centered on the waypoint location and the red icon is visible :) C:geo shall move form 4. to 8. directly :)

		From support mail (not yet verified): OU077B Saved cache description ok. I am using offline logs. Saved a basic &quot;found&quot; OK, but when adding to the log offline, it gives unable to retrieve needed info, or similar. Hit send log arrow. It gives a popup, &quot;loading log page OK&quot; Expected behavior: Work like GC.com.

		From support mail: Sygic is not enabled as navigation method although Sygic is installed. Further investigation shows, that the users uses another Sygic app called &quot;Sygic voucher edition&quot;. The only difference should be an included activation code from some promotion. However I can reproduce that Sygic stays disabled in our navigation menu after the voucher edition has been installed like the user reports. I only don't know whether it is related to a difference within the different Sygic apps or just us by having a too strict check method?

		When Google geocoder (used to transform addresses into coordinates) fails or is not installed in the phone, we resort to geocaching.com simple geocoder which returns one set of coordinates and return the caches from geocaching.com located near those coordinates. As a consequence, caches from other connectors are not fetched. When the geocaching.com connector is active, we should use its geocoder as a fallback for Google geocoder instead of a special case for loading geocaching.com caches. Also, some other geocaching sites may provide their own geocoders.

Original: Das anzeigen der caches von PQs funktioniert, aber das speichern leider nicht mehr seit dem neuesten update. Es geht nur noch ein einzelnen speichern der caches, aber nicht mehr der gesamten liste. Da hängt sich das programm auf.

		Found with market version 2014.12.12. while on vacation: Cache GC35RQ4 is saved offline Open the cache Swipe to get the cache description Result: My S3 shows a delay of around 12 seconds until the description page is shown My Galaxy Note still needs about 8 seconds The description contains quite some images, but not hundreds of them. As the cache is saved and I was offline, I guess it cant be that loading from network causes this delay

		This is not reproducible but botheres me the whole day today: Version 2014.12.12 Slow network connection Caches are saved offline I entered a search term in the search function on the main screen which matches an offline saved cache I selected one of the results shown At this point sometimes a windows &quot;Loading cache details&quot; comes up and stays for 10-20 sedonds. As the caches are all offline I dont understand what kind of activity is going on here. Not reproducible, either it depends on the specific cache or the speed or availability of the network connection?!

		Hey, I have a problem with the c:geo app. Every time I use the map the scale is fuzzy. Sometimes, in the caches description there are fuzzy letters or numbers, too. See http://www.directupload.net/file/d/3837/6d6svt4k_png.htm Is it a bug? Thanks for helping, melawe (I use samsung galaxy duos gt s7582, android 4.2.2)

		Hello all, I have been surprised today to see that the last update of c:geo doesn't work any more with Bluetooth GPS (app to connect my Globalsat BT-338 Bluetooth GPS Receiver) Bluetooth GPS get a fix but C:geo show a wrong position far from the correct one. Moreover the blue aim and the map are stuck even if you move. I double checked with GPS Status and GPS Test, they work correctly so the the issue defunately comes from C:geo

		Since yesterday, after installing the android update on my Device: Samsung S4 Mini Android: 4.4.2 Kernel: 3.4.0-3173303 c:geo: 2014.12.12 it is not possible to enter coordinates at the waypoint dialog anymore. When touching the coordinate field, the app crashes. When touching one of the other fields, I can edit them. On a different device, same model, different kernel the app works fine Device: Samsung S4 Mini Android: 4.4.2 Kernel: 3.4.0-3011164 c:geo: 2014.12.12

		This issue was raised by SammysHP. It is not fully deterministic, but I was able to produce at least one affected cache with every try with the following recipe: Start c:geo, open live-map, switch off 'live' move to a region where no caches are stored, select a zoom level so that you expect &gt;~20 caches in the view switch on 'live', wait for the caches to be displayed select 'store offline' to a new list when the download is finished, the caches are still displayed as unreliable (I would have expected an update here) directly start opening caches and checking the log page for missing statistics I assume some sort of timing, but couldn't find any clues to that in the log

		App still worked on Saturday after last update, but on Monday the blue arrow of the own Position is missing and neither the map nor the compass adjusts to the current position. I am not sure but I suppose it was the display rotation I activated on Monday. Since then I have this issue. I think These issues are already reported: #4533 and #4540

		I know that recent changes are the cause of it, so this is to discuss if any improvement is necessary/possible. From support mail: in older versions one came back to the last position at the maps when opening 'live maps', in the new version c:geo forgets the last position and always starts at the center of the actual city. This means scrolling every time when opening 'live maps'. Is this to be a feature? To me it behaves more like a bug - is it posible to re-configure c:geo to old behaviour? Before, with GPS on, it always showed the present position. With GPS off, it memorized the place that was last shown/chosen. In this state, there was an issue. After I turned off GPS, I needed to remove app from memory and restart it, otherwise, it still showed the map from last GPS known point. Now, even with GPS off, it always show the map from my home position, even if I'm not at home. I have turned off WiFi also, but it still shows the map at my home location. For example, I select a directory &quot;Faro&quot; where there are caches from a certain area and choose the map icon to show them on the map. Then I go back to the main page and select the Live Map. It shows at my home location, instead of &quot;Faro&quot; location, as it was before. Also, following your instructions to select the &quot;active Live Map&quot; in the &quot;Faro&quot; area, all found caches also appear, despite the option is set to hide them. In my opinion, I think the previous behavior is much better, because in any map location there's always the option to go to the present location, by clicking in the &quot;target&quot; icon at the top, right? The opposite is not possible.

		We have some users on support mail which have problems using the compass starting with 2014.12.09: The distance is correct but the direction is randomly changing. &quot;Use GPS and Compass&quot; is active. If the users select &quot;Use GPS only&quot; the direction gets stable and correct (while moving) Disabling GooglePlayServices makes no difference Compass in other apps (Groundspeak, GPS Status, etc.) works without a problem Devices: Sony Xperia SP (C5303), FW.205, Android 4.3 other model informations requested (will be added later)

		The RC version 2012.12.20-RC2 was tested by myself with respect to the known fixed problems (as far as possible) and for general usage. No regressions found so far, so we decided to publish it to fix the most urgent issues reportes after the last feature release. Publish will take place soon. Update follows.

		There should be a way to vote from the cache details screen, without the need to use the logging activity. It should encourage users to vote more often. E.g. we could always display the row with the own rating (instead of only when he/she already voted), and ask the user for his vote on tapping that row.

		I sometimes do cache series, where you get a clue (like a character to number mapping) in each of the caches, and using all together you can find a bonus mystery of that series. I typically store that clue as personal note in the cache where I found it, but sometimes I forget to write it down after logging. I envision that the app could ask me with an input dialog after logging automatically, given the following conditions: A setting for this feature has been activated. A certain text is found in the cache description, in German a typical word would be &quot;Bonuszahl&quot;. The personal note is empty. What do others think of this? A drawback is the dependency to pattern matching, without knowing the language of the cache description. We would basically need to search for all language patterns at once (e.g. English, French, German,...), without making this a translatable string.

			<description>
		I have HTC Wildfire S, HTC Sense 2.1, Android 2.3.5 with c:geo 2014.12.22 installed and 1196 caches in offline storage. The update section says (in German) &quot;No updates available for this phone. This phone is at the most recent status&quot;. The SQLite c:geo database seems to be OK (no errors reported with PRAGMA integrity_check) but I have used c:geo for quite a while so it may be that some entries do not comply with the current version's requirements... I use a prepaid card so c:geo is used exclusively offline (except when having a WiFi around and loading new caches). However, using c:geo I get crashes (&quot;Tut uns leid! Die Anwendung c:geo...&quot;) almost everywhere: opening the offline map (using OSM maps) logging in when first starting c:geo (rare and difficult to reproduce) when starting c:geo and Wireless has recently been disabled but c:geo still thinks it's logged in (shown in the bottom line &quot;login OK&quot;) when moving the map around or starting map view for a cache waypoint that had been opened from the map view already most importantly: when downloading one or several caches for offline use The last issue is very reproducible: Downloading more than three caches at once is a gamble with less than 5% chance of luck. More than four hasn't happened more often than once or twice in the last two years. It seems to increase when the GPS is on but this may only be a subjective impression. Downloading a single cache from the map view also leads to a definite crash in few cases, the most recent one being GC4Z71P (Jura-Höhenweg Teil 1). Map movement crashes are also easy to cause: Zoom out until more than ~200 caches are shown at once and simply move the map around a few times. Crash guaranteed. After a crash, sometimes c:geo reopens the map view automatically (rare case) or reopens itself automatically (frequent) or doesn't reopen at all (also frequent). Nothing else (except for sometimes BatteryBot Battery Indicator and sometimes Llama) is running in the background. I have debug logging enabled so there should be a few memory dumps. Is anyone interested in solving this issue so that I can send them in? I reject Google Play Services so reporting doesn't work (unfortunately). Best regards, Eingehirner

		When viewing my list of stored caches, if I select to sort by &quot;Date stored on device&quot; this works, and shows the oldest stored cache at the top of the list. If I then choose the menu option again to sort by &quot;Date stored on device&quot; the list is reversed, so that the most recently stored cache as as the top of the list (which I find more useful). However, if I then drop a cache from this list, the sort order is lost - specifically, the caches are sorted again with the oldest stored cache at the top of the list. Please allow my preference of having the most recently stored cache at the top of the list to be remembered.

		I love c:geo - have been using it ever since I got a smartphone, but I've recently encountered a rather annoying issue. The compass no longer works. The distance to the cache updates fine, but the compass does not function properly. It seems to only want to bounce between 2 different headings (between 0-30 degrees and between 180-210 degrees). This only became an issue within the past few weeks; I'm not sure if it was after an update or not. I check the compass in other apps, and it works fine elsewhere. I've also tried it both using GPS and compass and GPS only, and neither one works. Is there something I can do to fix this issue? I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app with the same issue still present. I use a Samsung Galaxy S3 (SPH-L710) running Android version 4.4.2

		Since Google Play Services 6.5, the monolithic library has been split into multiple libraries. We should use that new version, as it will reduce the size of our app, avoid DEX problems when building and generally introduces new features. There is an issue however: The new version is only available in AAR format, which is not recognized by Eclipse. I'll try to convert the AAR libraries into Eclipse projects, as otherwise Eclipse cannot be used anymore.

		Recently a limiter for static maps loading was introduced by @samueltardieu (If a 304 error is received the download is suspended for 30 seconds). While this is good to speed up the refresh process of caches it might be considered not useful for GPX imports while static maps loading is active. More precise: When importing a GPX the last import step is the download of static maps for the previously imported caches. This means in contrary to the refresh of caches the static maps download requests are bundled at one point, which means, that on the first occurence of a 304 the static map loading for all imported caches is skipped. While this is the current intended behavior I do see it as a problem for users who would like to use the static maps (e.g. offline after importing a GPX). How to find a useable solution for this....maybe only by implemting #3406?!

		I believe I have found a minor issue with c:geo. When logging in, cgeo gives you the number of your found caches, in my case 424. Now, using c:geo, I submit a DNF log for a cache. When I return to the initial screen, the number of found caches is now 425 -- cgeo mistakenly has counted the DNF as a find. Only when cgeo has to go to the GS server (e.g. when I ask for nearby caches) does the number drop back to the correct value of 424. I have seen this issue when reporting DNFs (as usual) on caches hidden by others, but I have also tested it by reporting a DNF on one of my caches -- same problem.

		When cgeo is used to beam a cache to another device, we do not explicitly request that cgeo is open if present. One one of my devices, this leads to a browser being opened instead of cgeo, because I once opted out for Firefox instead of cgeo on this tablet. However, here the intention is clear: beaming from cgeo should favor opening cgeo on the remote device. We need to add an AAR (Android Application Record) to the Ndef message. I propose to include one commit (57c41e9) as soon as possible in the release, as it will not change the behavior but will ensure that explicit requests to use cgeo will be handled properly. The second commit (525d94c) will then be added to the master branch only. While this way of doing is not strictly necessary, that would allow people with version N-1 of cgeo to receive explicit beams sent by version N as well. Thoughts?

		I have written a URL for a trackable to an NFC tag but when I scan it I only get the option to open it in one of my two browsers. If I click the same link in for example an email I get the option to also open it in c:geo. As I understand this is because Android doesn't detect c:geo as capable of opening NFC url:s. I also tried writing the URL for a geocache to a NFC tag with the same result, I only get to chose one of my two browser for opening it when scanned. (I would be really neat to have this feature since the NFC tag in question is implanted in my hand and I want people to be able to log it easily with c:geo when scanning it) I found something related to this issue here: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/84173/how-to-set-default-browser-used-by-nfc

		With version 2015.01.07-RC I can see a new behavior: When selecting Menu - &quot;Refresh all&quot; I experience a short delay before the refresh starts and the progress window is shown. Subjectively (I have to test) it rises with the amount of caches on the list to be refreshed. For a list of 100 caches it is a noticeable delay of approx. 1 second.

		Hi : Android 4.1.1 c:gep 2014.12.22 I did a refresh of 200 caches two days ago and when out in the field, found the wrong images at several caches. I came home, cleared all caches and files from sdcard/.cgeo. Then reloaded ti 200 caches, and still wrong pictures. I deleted as much as possible and cleared as much caching as I could and loaded one cache and it loaded the images from another nearby cache. Then I deleted all again and this time it loaded one correct image. So, it could be local caching troubles, but if anyone else see it, please report it.

		Split up from #4552 Following the above mentioned issue and the reports we get on support mail and Facebook we can break down current compass problem to this specific one: Device: HTC One (M7) Android: 4.4.3 Description: When rotating the phone the compass does not turn steady but will jump by 180° as soon as this angle is reached Same bevavior with the arrow on map Independently of Google Play Service settings Not yet tested if Low-power mode On/Off makes any difference At the same time other compass apps are working normal (i.e. the sensors itself seem to work fine) Current RC-version 2015.01.07-RC does not solve the problem I sent a video from a user showing that issue to the cgeo-dev mailing list on 07.01.2015. @arteos Can you kindly test if enabling &quot;Low power&quot; in c:geo Menu - Settings - System makes any difference for this issue? Can you please fall back to version 2014.11.04 (Download from here: https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/releases/tag/market_20141104) and check if the compass is normal in this version? There are also reports with HTC One Mini, Android 4.4.2 but sadly without a clear description whether it is the same problem (jumping by 180°). I will ask those users via support mail to describe in more detail.

		Split up from #4552 Device: Sony XPeria SP (C5303), FW.205 Android: Android 4.3 Description: If the phone is rotated normally the arrow is only reacting very sluggish and never reaches the correct direction. If the phone is rotated fast the arrow aso moves really fast but also ends up in a totally wrong direction. Independently of using &quot;Google Play Services&quot; It is currently unclear whether this happens with and/or without &quot;low power mode&quot;. I asked via support mail but got no feedback up to now.

		In #4552 and also on support mail an unusual amount of people are describing that a pure deinstallation + new installation of version 2014.12.22 solved their compass problem. All of them had the problem, that the compass was randomly moving or fixed to a random position and it was working normal in other compass apps at the same time. I was wondering if there is any &quot;default value&quot;, &quot;compass state&quot; or alike we store somewhere which is incorrect / out of range and might only get cleared on a new installation. This is the only reason I could imagine where a reinstallation could make any difference.

		I am sure we already have an issue somewhere with a similar thing (or it is just on Google Play crash reports up to now): Normally this issue happens after using the live map quite a long time (scrolling, loading, and so on).

		Version 2015.01.12: Open live map Set live map strategy to fast Scroll to an area without any saved caches Select Menu - Show as List Select Menu - Export - GPX The resulting GPX is empty (besides the header). It seems meaningful, that nothing is exported because we have nothing but the name, the type and the geocode of those caches. On the other hand: If I perform a nearby search and export it to the GPX, the caches are actually exported with what we have (in this case D/T, favpoints, coords but still no description). I don't know what conditions apply for the cache to be exportable. Mabye we should gnereally disable exporting if the caches are not stored?

		A lot of mysteries use a checker with a spoiler in the solution, and I copy/paste the URL of the picture in my Personal Note to retrieve it quickly when I am on the spot. But it's very annoying to copy the URL (very difficult with my fingers and the screen, and i'm not alone in my case), and then, open the browser and paste it. Can you make it clickable? Thanks!

		Hello, when I use OSM maps (online or offline) then very often skips the map to the North (typically from Prag to Svalbard; from America to north Canada). The skip happens when I move by map. Sometime the skip happens, when I put off my finger from display. Google maps in c:geo are OK without this problem. I have smartphone ZTE Z5mini, Androiid 4.2.2, c:geo 2015.01.20 and some older version. For more information contact me, please. Best Regards Vohary PS: edit 24.1.2015

		Yesterday I was in a town nearby and wanted to store all traditional caches in viewport for offline. Steps: Start c:geo Open live map (which is OSM 0.3) Show as a list Filter type only showing traditional Store for offline After storing c:geo was stopped. SG3 2014-12-29-NB-c3d85fc My SG3 seemed slow to me, so maybe there was less memory. However, maybe after storing we don't return to the previous map instance? Will try it at another location with newest NB.

		2015.01.25-NB (also present in 2015.01.20 as reported on support mail). Happens also in other scenarios where the cache is opened directly from map. Not sure whether it is a regression, but I think so as I never noticed it before. Search for GC5K2A1 Open the cache details Note that the cache has a spoiler pic which is correctly indicated on the description tab Open the spoiler picture, is is shown normally. It is also visible on the image tab Select Navigate - Map Click on the cache to open popup Select more details Result: The link to the spoiler pic is missing on the description tab and the picture is not shown on the image tab. Selecting &quot;refresh&quot; will show it again until the next test cycle (unless the cache is saved).

		Hi, I'm using c:geo, and I'm happy with it. Thanks for your work! However, I found some bugs. Here is the first. The offline map is not rendered properly. Depending on the zoom level, some portions are not displayed. I'm using offline map downloaded from mapsforge website, suggested in c:geo's FAQ. I don't know if the problem is with the c:geo or with the map. It's up to you to check it :} This bug is also present in one of my friends phone. You can find attached a screenshot how it looks. Best regards, kukukk

		Sorry, It seems that it was already reported and it's fixed: #4633 Hi, When I store the caches for offline use, images from hint are not downloaded. Even if I refresh all stored caches, the images is still missing. If I refresh the cache itself, the image appears. But it is stored only temporarily. If I leave cache details, go back to the map and select the cache again and lick on &quot;More details&quot; the image is missing. I hope you can fix it as soon as possible, because I had some bad lucks with it, being in a zone where there was no mobile internet and the only hint was that photo. Best regards, kukukk

		As of 2015-02-10, the MapQuest geocoder started to return 403 errors. It looks like this may be a larger issue as shown in: http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/forums/-/message_boards/message/1327001 As of 2015-02-11, the GeocoderTest.testMapQuestGeocoder test has been annotated with @Suppress. This annotation should be removed when the problem is solved, or when the MapQuest geocoder is removed from cgeo. Note that the unavailability of MapQuest does not impair the behaviour of cgeo in any way when other geocoders (Android, GC) are available.

		This is unreproducible right now, but while caching today I realized two times, that caches I was currently dealing with suddenly got marked as &quot;stored log&quot; while I did not actively do this. The offline logs contained my autoinserted signature. Trying it lateron I could not reproduce it. 2015.02.15-NB Option &quot;Log offline&quot; activated. Did anything change which could cause that?

		If I go for e.g. a multi cache I add waypoints on the waypoint tab of the cache and then use the map icon in the actionbar to open the map and get an overview of all waypoints. Now this will also show the heading line and distance overlay to the cache coords. While this is meaningful when starting the map from cache details it is not meaningful for mapping a bunch of waypoints of a cache. Couldn't we either disable it for this view or automatically set it to the latest waypoint which has coords?

		While with yesterdays version (2015.02.14-NB) the actionbar on the waypoint tab of a cache contained a map icon, it now (2015.02.15-NB1) has the same structure as on the cache detail tab. I would strongly suggest to have the map icon located at first position as implemented before.

		Sometimes (unfortunately i cannot reproduce it), the text of the second waypoint is duplicated into the first for saved caches. Screenshot for GC4E28K: „Der Yogi bewacht C und D“ belongs to the second WP, Stage 1. Text for first WP (Start) is gone. This is different from #3420. The error is permanent and persists across refreshes of the saved cache. Also WP detail view shows the wrong text. Unfortunately, the error appears infrequently, and the circumstances are unclear to me. I noticed it 4-5 times during the last months, but never was annoyed enough to open an issue. Version 2015.02.16-NB, but i suspect the error occurs during saving of the cache, which was quite a long time ago now, and thus happened with an older version.

		The [NUMBER] placeholder is off by one in Twitter. I suppose that results from the way the value is formed in the tag engine, which I suspect to be $count+1 because the soon to be published log is one number higher than the current found count. The Twitter backend is called after logging, when $count was already incremented, resulting in the off-by-one bug.

		I'm currently working on a project to create maps from an amalgamation of data (OSM, OS, shapefiles). These are processed to generate a single OSM file which I am then processing with Osmosis and mapsforge mapfile-writer to generate .map file to be viewed on various Android apps. These maps almost always work on all the maps and apps I've tested (Atlas application on Windows and Locus/Orux/cgeo on Android). I have one map which causes a crash when I try to load it in cgeo on both my tablet and my phone. Other than looking at the log file and asking here is there any easy way to find what might be causing the problem? I've tested maybe 5 other maps (almost all covering larger areas and one much larger one which includes the area causing the fault) and they all work fine. I've uploaded 2 maps to Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/chaxjx4oxtjs9ih/AACf9g0wNcRgCOB5n4IaMWDOa?dl=0) OS_NU_android crashes and OS_TEST_android (which is a subset of it) doesn't.

		Hi c:geo team, sometimes, spoilers or log photos of geocaches are not displayed in c:geo, when storing cache for offline use (or even online). Example : spoiler of http://coord.info/GC3CJ0K cgeo version 2015.01.20, android version 4.4.2 or android version 4.1.2 Other example with missing some log images : GC1PCV7 If you could something... thanks :)

		2015.02.21-NB Not sure if this is a duplicate of a still open issue or a returning error. Today I managed to log a cache offline (I think via live map popup) and it was not showing up in the history afterwards. Looking at the cache list it had a orange maker, looking at its details it had the status &quot;Saved log&quot; BUT it did not have the date written behind that. I performed again Menu - Log offline - Found and afterwards the date was shown in details and it showed up in the history. Reproducing this problem failed up to now, so mainly a reminder for myself or anyone interested in trying to reproduce that. If its indeed a duplicate, feel free to close it.

		I know that one can save caches for offline use and that there's a list of what I logged, but there should be a list of recently opened caches, just like it is on geocache.com profile main page. It would be very helpful for a typical usage scenario where I visit several caches but don't want to fiddle around with the smartphone for writing the log text, but log at home in peace and comfortably. And for that I'd need a view of the visited caches in the order of opening. I assume it should be quite easy to implement, there would be no need to synchronize with the geocache.com list, but only store locally in c:geo the last x caches which were opened in detail.

		2015.02.22-NB If I am not completely wrong the TB logbook normally contains the geocache name alongside with dropped, retrieve and visit logs. However for me the TB TB4TXR0 does not show them in the logbook. Did not check if only this one or all TBs are affected. Maybe a website change or I just remember incorrect.

		Open a map for a stored list of caches. Enable &quot;live&quot; from the menu. Switch to another map provider. Live is disabled again (which can lead to no caches visible at all, if you scrolled out of the area of stored caches).

		We are already have a mechanism which will sort lists containing only events by date automatically instead of by distance. I was wondering if we could similarly detect that all caches have a common prefix (i.e. belong to a series) and in that case sort by name by default. Does anyone see a problem with that? If not, I may try implementing this.

		We still have two mapsforge libraries in our code. I'd like to remove the 0.24 version. We introduced that to enable people to use their 0.24 maps instead of just showing an error, because our 0.3 library cannot load them. That was 2.8 years ago, and people should have new maps by now. Any good reason not to remove the 0.24 support?

		Hello Team, i have a question about a Mystery and the Personal Cache Note. If i have saved the final Coordinates in the mystery cache (online Gecaching) and i save the cache offline i must ever open before i can see the final waypoint on the map. Why i have to open it again, because if i have now internet the waypoint isn't avaiable in my case. What is the reason? You can answer in germany ;-) DramyFB

		I'm more and more stumbling over an issue: I want to use Android libraries in cgeo, which can only be consumed as source or via gradle. Using Eclipse I therefore must go with the source option for now (this is also nice because often we need tiny fixes in the library). Instead of copying the library verbatim, can git submodules be used to actually just refer to their github repo? From the description of it in the git documentation, it sounds fitting very well Example: The showview library currently exists as verbatim copy in our repo, so we will probably not update it. If it were a submodule, this would be easy to do. @samueltardieu You probably have the most experience there. I'm rather sure we discussed this or a related submodule question already, but I can't find this anymore.

		When opening a map, it gets an initial title which does not change afterwards. But several options menus make the map behave totally different. Therefore on activating the &quot;live&quot; option, the map should call itself &quot;life map&quot; on disabling the &quot;live&quot; option, the map should call itself &quot;map&quot;. This is most confusing when the map was started from a list, where it (correctly) takes the list title initiallly.

		@samueltardieu added the ability to view and open embedded images under the &quot;Images&quot; tab after my posted issue #3661 Really great and useful! But far from all caches shows the image under the &quot;Images&quot; tab. These does include the image: http://coord.info/GC5NHA1 http://coord.info/GC4TZMH These does not include the image: http://coord.info/GC1EH4K http://coord.info/GC5NV7Q I suspect it has something to do with the file size of the image. That it does not show images below a certain file size to filter out language flags, smileys and other &quot;unwanted&quot; images. If I'm right that filter should be removed so that all images are shown. Or the file size threshold should at least be lowered.

		In #4290 we discussed that the current name is quite irritating. I suggest to rename that main menu to &quot;Coordinates&quot; for the time we have it, as this is exactly what is behind that menu...you can enter coordinates. Opinions? Remark: If that is OK, some could do the favor to replace it by the already existing string search_coordinates as it would not require new translations then.

Wen choosing this option the dir is set to /storage/emulated/0, which is the internal storage. The external is located on /storage/sdcard1. This is almost the problem described in faqs (http://faq.cgeo.org/#1_67) Possible this dialog/feature would be working on more phones if the user could choose the directory like for external maps.

		I am at my parent's place. &quot;nearby caches&quot; lists 19 caches. One of them is a solved mystery that is saved in a list and has a changed &quot;final&quot; waypoint. When i press the &quot;map&quot; icon in the &quot;nearby&quot; list, the subtitle changes to &quot;1 cache&quot; instead of &quot;19 caches&quot; and the map view only shows 2 waypoints, the original and the newly set of that stored solved mystery. Then i saved another cache from the nearby-list, and now map view shows this 2 caches. Happened with NB 2015-03-19, still present in 2015-03-28.

		From support: Ever since this new update 3/28/15, when I push navigate, there is a thick irritating stright red line from my present position aiming at and all the way to the geocache where I want to go. I do not want it there! It is distracting and gets in the way of reading Street names and other things. How can I make it go away? I looked at settings and do not know how to disengage it. Maybe it is a Google map thing and has nothing to do with c:geo. Any helpful advice is welcomed.

		Currently the user enters his login and password and additionally has to select &quot;Retrieve API key&quot;. This could be redesigned to make it look likt e.g. the authorization to Opencaching sites. Just enter a username and password and select &quot;Authorize&quot; to complete it. Not yet sure however about how this thing works.

			<description>
		With 2015.03.28-NB1 (incl. Geokrety PR) I see the following problem: Each cache does only list one TB in the inventory list independently if GK connector is active or not. For example: GC3TCGP contains 2 TBs (as of 28.03.2015 - Might change!) Open it with 2015.03.28 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, both TBs are shown in Inventory-Tab Open with 2015.03.28-NB1 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, only one TB shown in inventory Another example (with mixed TB/GK): GC3FJ5F contains 2 TB and 1 GK (as of 28.03.2015 - Might change!) Open it with 2015.03.28 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, both TBs are shown in Inventory-Tab Open with 2015.03.28-NB1 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, only one TB and one GK shown in inventory It seems that now only 1 TB is shown

		In the context of ̀LogTrackableActivity, the text &quot;Loading Log Page…&quot; doesn't fit well. I've got the message displayed when trying to log a TB while not connected to the GC service. Something like &quot;Logging is not possible…&quot; would fit better in the context. This string is also used in LogCacheActivity. I propose to: Create a new string for the LogCacheActivity, saying &quot;Loading Log Page…&quot; Change the text to &quot;Logging is not possible…&quot; for the LogTrackableActivity (which fit better to the string name)

		As discussed on IRC, should we activate GK lookup feature by default ? &quot;Question: Would it be better to switch &quot;Geokrety&quot; off by default to avoid a state where requests are done but no login is stored avoid additional network requests which the user might not want to have? [...]&quot; &quot;Looking at the fact that a huge percentage of users are in US (Where geokrets might be not so well known/used)...&quot; &quot;speaking of the traffic: Typical weekend case is 15k up to 20k of users online.&quot; &quot;lookup of geokreties will work without that [feature] being active&quot;

		Looking at the debug logs I saved yesterday (2015.03.29-NB) I have now seen requests like this http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?tracker=GKA301 in the c:geo log in parallel to the correct request to geokrety.org. Today 2015.03.30-NB1 I cannot reproduce this anymore. @kumy Was that solved by recent changes or an unreproducible behaviour?

		I suggest that we create a very small test suite of existing or new tests, which are only related to the parsing of the website. This test suite can then be scheduled to run every 30 minutes in a new job on Jenkins. That way we would get a much better overview of the times where the website is down or has changed the output again. So we can eventually react even more timely than now.

		When looking at the website www.geokrety.org I do see, that the names are used like: GeoKret for one of the trackables GeoKretyfor the service itself The current strings do not always follow that: We are mostly missing the capital letter K I am not sure if we refer to a GeoKret when speaking of a GK trackable. AFAIR I did see something like Geokrety not found or similar. This is not really important but still a thing which should be made consistent before the feature is release and before too much translations have been returned (which need to be translated again). @kumy: Can you provide a PR making this consistent? You probably know GK best and for what purpose the separate strings are used.

		Using cgeo on both the Lenovo A8-50 and Yoga 10 tablets is not possible. Get a line of cache icons and a messed up map. Seems to be a continuation of a previously flagged problem. Any idea how to fix it (either at user end or software update)? Thanks

		It appears that Twitter.postTweet gets always called with a coords parameter as null (no coordinates posted with the tweet). This is likely to be consistent with our privacy policy and our recently obtained ratings on Google Play Store. If there are no objections, I propose to keep the situation as-is and remove the useless coords parameter rather than implement the location-aware Twitter posting.

		GeoKrety.org provides SSL support, but they're certificate is self signed.. :/ Should I try to 'auto-accept' the &quot;bad&quot; certificate, or continue to not use SSL? GeKretyMap.org provides SSL, but our current Network library doesn't support SNI (#4991). Note: Already discussed on #4778 To sum up. @rsudev: I would definitely vote for trying to use SSL, because even with a self-signed certificate we get encryption. @samueltardieu: only if it doesn't make us accept any certificate, because we check the certificate for a number of sites already (extremcaching.com, geocaching.com, open.mapquestapi.com) and I would not want to allow MITM for those.

		It is possible to paste coords to wayponts. See #3799 But there is no way afaik to copy cords FROM waypoints. I find a need for this very often when I want to share coordinates with friends on the fly. One possible implementation of this might be to add a &quot;Copy coords&quot; option to the long-press menu of a waypoint. Another would be a &quot;Share coords&quot; option that presents a list of possible Share providers like on the Share Cache option.

		From facebook: I like c:geo a lot, but why does it (usually temporarily) count a NM log or a note as a find? Hi. It's strange, it's only a short term thing, but it increases the number of finds on the front page by one. It usually rectifies after logging out and in a couple of times. It obviously doesn't register on the gc.com site, as the count remains correct on there. Thanks for a great app though, and thanks for looking at a very minor niggle! Actually, we increase the find count on logging, independent of the type of the actual log. See GCParser 1176.

		I attended an opencaching event today and presented the upcoming GK feature. While the feature is considered as really great from the audience some of them suggested to have a better logging view. Due to the fact, that there is a new field for the time in the first row, the log type field became rather small, so that only a few letters are visisble. The proposal was to somehow rearrange the view to give more room for the log type. I currently do not have any great idea how this could look like. Maybe we can move the date and time to a separate row below the log type?

		I attended an opencaching event today and presented the upcoming GK feature. Users have been wondering why we show the &quot;Unknown&quot; in the owner field of a GK. AFAIK we don't get the information via the API, but &quot;Unknown&quot; was misunderstood by users. Can't we just ommit the field completely as long as this function is not implemented?

		I attended an opencaching event today and presented the upcoming GK feature. A big challenge for many users was, that they did not know what to do when they tried to log a GK for the first time and ended up in the info window telling that anonymous logging is not possible. Instead of having just OK as an option we should have a second button to open the geokrety settings directly in that info window. Furthermore we should slightly adapt the text not only to say &quot;Please register&quot; but &quot;Please register or login with your existing account from geokrety.org&quot;.

		The &quot;visual compass state&quot; added in 4723c5a should help the user distinguish between &quot;compass mode&quot; and &quot;GPS only mode&quot;. At this stage, the design is very basic, and the strings that have been reused (@string/attribute_compass_yes and @string/attribute_compass_no) are not appropriate and are ambiguous in some languages. The design should be improved if needed, and new strings should be defined and used.

		I open a new issue instead of commenting on the closed issue #4725. Is this the right way to do it? I think that the fix by @Bananeweizen did only solve half of the problem though. The behavior is still illogical when trying to deselect the search bar by pressing the back key. When you first press the search bar, the last shown caches are shown in the dropdown and the keyboard is shown, allowing you to enter a search query. When you select a cache from the list the search bar gets deselected in the correct way. Showing the default controls in the action bar next time you come back to the home page. Perfect! But when you press the back button instead, the first state is like the below screenshot, This step is unnecessary since you cannot enter anything in the search field anyway when the keyboard is hidden When you press the back button a second time this action bar is shown: ...instead of the default action bar setup below that should be shown instead: So my suggestion is that you should only have to press the back button once to deselect the search field.

		Looking at 4723c5a wrong strings seem to be used for the new button. We misuse the stings attribute_compass_yes and attribute_compass_nowhich are intended for the text form of cache attributes. I just changed them to match the new function not recognizing, that they are used also in other places. I will revert that commit in a minute. We should either use the original strings use_gps and use_compass or create new strings for this button.

			<description>
		Recently the disabling of GPS in some views was modified to be applied only in &quot;Low power mode&quot; to allow users to keep a GPS fix as long as c:geo is running (as it might take some time depending on the device to re-fix GPS). Still quite some users ask for keeping the GPS also if: Screen is locked c:geo is active in the background So this is feature request (I checked but did not find a matching issue) to &quot;keep the GPS-lights on while c:geo is started&quot; as an additional option in the System settings.

		I suggest that we remove the trail feature due to severe limitations: It doesn't work correctly, if the screen is off. It has a restricted buffer size (so it cannot track multiple hours). It looses the trail when reopening the map. There are many more explicit tracking apps. E.g. I have Endomondo tracking my geocaching walkings through the forest. 👍 1 👎 7

		2015.04.16-NB We had such an issue on support mail (or even here as an issue) but I was not able to reproduce or find a hint in our code: This morning at approx. 06:30am CEST I logged two TB (retrieve log) I am quite sure that the log date shown in c:geo was 17.04. (which would be correct) but I did not explicitly verify it , at least I did not change it manually Looking this evening at the website I see that those logs have the date 16.04. (e.g. http://www.geocaching.com/track/log.aspx?LUID=58d79e3f-56d5-4595-bbbe-326b8add5390) The time zone settings of my device (Galaxy S4, Android 5.0.1) is set to factory value, i.e. derive from mobile network. Checking the world clock app it confirms the timezone used as GMT+2 (which is correct). Can someone check if we send the log with just the absolute date or do we try to transmit a time and time zone info as well?

		Does c:geo support receiving outside intents with coordinates as extras, to start a new waypoint / open the compass with those coordinates? I'm very new to the android programming scene and due to lack of experience cant yet grasp your source code just by looking at it. I'm working on an application that has an option to share coordinates and i would love to give the users an option to open them on c:geo. If this is possible, i hope you can point me to the right intent + class name.

		I use c:geo for offline caching, but lately I've been having an issue where any field notes it exports are blank. At first I thought it was an error in uploading to geocaching.com, but I checked the field notes folder on my HTC's drive, and all the recent ones are blank. At the moment I am just logging my caches offline, then going into history and exporting them. This has been working perfectly for several months, but on my last holiday it stopped and I have had to log everything manually, which has been a huge hassle. Is this a bug, or do I need to be doing something different?

		If I make offline logs during a geocacheing session, I can't see them in c:geo. Only on the map, when i scroll to the position of the cache, the cache with the red smiley is shown. I think it would be usefull, if a cache is logged offline, that the cache will automatically saved on the default list or on a list like 'offline logs'.

		The actual implementation of the NextPageGeocacheListLoader doesn't use parallelCombineActive. In case of multiple connectors supporting loading next page calls will be parallelized. (However, as of today we only have GC connetor supporting this). This will be necessary for #4802. The &quot;load more cache&quot; function should call parallelCombineActive, as retrieving Generic Trackable will be hooked there.

		In the current version of c:geo it is only possible to move a cache from one list to another. It would be nice to have a feature to copy them too. Often you want to hold one cache on more than one list. An example case, where it is useful to keep one cache on multiple lists could be: Caches in my Hometown Caches, that I want to find today Caches that I have not found and plan to retry in the future Caches that I have found Another annoying thing is, that when I import a GPX file into one list it removes caches with the same IDs from other lists.

			<description>
		For some months, c:geo sometimes crashes when displaying the geocache details page. Unfortunately, this bug is not reproducible (can't trigger it directly) but still happens quite often during normal use. I'm running Android 4.4.4 (Samsung S3 LTE, not rooted) with recent releases of c:geo (from Google Play store). I've send a couple of those automated bug reports (usually like &quot;crash while viewing cache details&quot;), but today's crash (5.5.2015) starts with the (hopefully unique) label &quot;AMK4711A&quot;, just in case you want to debug this specific crash. There are two ways the crash happens. (1) When I'm on the map screen (OpenAndroMaps locally stored) and touch a geocache icon (traditional, geocaching.com), a small overlay window opens. There I can touch &quot;More details&quot; to launch the geocache details page. And this is when the crashes happen. (2) When I'm editing the &quot;Personal note&quot; of a geocache and touch &quot;OK&quot; to return to the geocache details page, then c:geo also is likely to crash. It doesn't matter if GPS, WLAN or Mobile networks (or any combination of it) is switched on or off. There's plenty of memory and disk space available (usually, c:geo is the only app actively running). Rebooting the phone doesn't change anything. The only common thing of all the crashes is that they always happen when the geocache details page(s) is going to be displayed. There's no crash by just switching back and forth between the sub-pages of the geocache details (like waypoints, overview, description, logs etc.) If you need additional information, please let me know. If it helps I can assign the same &quot;unique&quot; label (see above) to future crash reports so they can be referenced easily.

		Hi, I'm reviewing the french translation and I have noticed a button in cache details (see screen capture) which can not exceed 6 caracters ... it's very very short (I would like to translate this button to &quot;Recharger&quot; a word only 9 caracters long) Note: I think there is enough place here to put a bigger button and I'm sure I'm not the only user/translator who found this &quot;6 caracters limit&quot; too short for a button label. Thanks for your attention,

		Hi, would it be possible to provide a simple F-Droid repository for the cgeo apk? There is a Howto here: https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Setup_an_FDroid_App_Repo. This would allow all F-Droid users to get updates automatically, even if cgeo is sadly not part of F-Droid. Thanks!

		Hi, I left the following message to the geocaching.com site: &quot;How can I store my user interface language more permanently. Apparently, this option uses cookies to store language? I don't want to store cookies permanently, because I also use public computers. If I close browser and logged in again, the user interface language setting is returned back to original.&quot; ..and geocaching.com answer: &quot;Hello, Thank you for contacting Geocaching HQ. Do you use the Android app c:geo? There is a bug currently in the app that is reverting your language settings back to English on our website. Since this is third party website, we have no control over fixing it. You will have to reach out to c:geo for additional support. Please let us know if you have further questions. Kindly, Janelle Geocaching Community Manager&quot;

		I have seen that on a users device at the giga in Mainz, need to reproduce myself. Steps probably necessary to reproduce: have an unfound cache on your device (detailed yes, stored?) have setting filter found caches active log the cache as found on the website go to the live map showing the cache in question the cache is still visible (which is as expected) switch the filter found caches setting off the cache gets the found smilie attached when refresh finished switch the filter found caches setting on again the smilie vanishes, the cache is still shown!

		2015.05.18-NB Open GKC240 The &quot;spotted&quot; field shows &quot;in GC1HKWQ&quot; but in fact the GK was only visited there and is still with a user (with myself). For a GC trackable the user name of the curent holder is shown in such a case. Not sure whether this is a bug or a different function at GK.

		This follows #4787 &quot;GK visit should be possible without geocode&quot;. Now, it is possible to log a GK without specifying a cache Geocode, but (IMHO) this may not be a &quot;good practice&quot; as GC coordinates are not automatically imported in GeoKrety service database, this make logging on the GK website difficult for newbies. GC/coordinates are 1st stored when user log GK ; next GK log in same GC cache will prefill coordinates from last input. In #4787, I proposed to show a message to users when no Geocode was filled. Text could be: &quot;You're about to send a log without a cache Geocode. It's encouraged to set one. Do you really want to proceed?&quot; We could also add a &quot;remain choice&quot; checkbox to not annoy users...

		Assuming that c:geo would be able to get API access from Groundspeak: Which points of the existing API license agreement would need to be discussed and/or modified to match our requirements? Can we keep all existing functions if we change to the API or what technical modifications would be needed for the API to achieve this? I found this help page via Google, but don't know if this reflects the current API.

		This follows PR #4859. Actual icon for TB doesn’t seem to suit for everyone... Current icons for Trackables are: Unknown: TravelBug: GeoKrety: Swaggie: New proposed icon for TB: Extracted exchanges from old PR. @SammysHP said: I'd prefer the first one. Why? Because it shows &quot;Travelbug and Geocoin&quot; – you can't distinguish between them. What we need is this first icon and an icon for Geokretys. @kumy said: I've hacked the existing icon a bit to build the TravelBug icon. @SammysHP said: I'd use a question mark for unknown, in your draft unknown and travelbug are rather similar. @Lineflyer said: I would currently not like to use a question mark for an unknown brand, because in our current way of loading all GC-trackables are unknown as long as you only look at the inventory of a cache. If the standard GC-only user opens a GC cache it would be OK and correct if he would see this icon IMO:

		Summary: Refreshing all caches in a list caused repeated caches to be displayed on screen with different information. I had 14 caches stored in my &quot;Found List&quot; and I was logging them on my computer. When I completed my logging (on the computer) I did a &quot;Refresh All&quot; in c:geo and the caches refreshed. (I wanted to verify that I hadn't missed logging any.) What was displayed after that was a combination of &quot;unfound&quot; caches and &quot;found&quot; caches of the same name. It appeared to have not cleared the previous state properly before reloading the cache. To clarify: Some caches were displayed twice, once with the &quot;Cache Found&quot; green bar, and once without. See attached screen shot. Exiting the list and re-entering refreshed the display correctly.

		We need to change some hyperlinks within c:geo as soon as we release the new webpage. IMO it would be good if someone can prepare a PR for this, so that we can merge it at a point of time when the website is ready. AFAIR we have quite some links to the FAQ in some message windows, in &quot;About c:geo&quot; and in statusupdate.java (closeout warning for 2.2) which need to be changed accordingly.

		Hi, The same string is displayed in 2 different contexts in the app and it's make them hard to translate because: the meaning are slightly different and the available space is also quite different. See screen captures attached: Context 1 in parameters: results displayed when checking login/password Context 2 on the home: connection status with gc.com.

		Starting with 2015.05.22-NB1 I seem to have extreme inconsistencies on my lists of saved caches. Example: I open a list named GdH with 15 caches I open one of them and close it again Returning to the list I do see that all caches shown belong to the history list but not my list The header still shows GdH as name but a count of 81 caches (which is the amount of caches in the history list) Leaving and reentering the lists solves it Trying to explitcitly reproduce it was not succesfull, but it keeps happening in various ways.

		Some people do not know how to drop a TB because they do not see the list under the log text input field. Some sort of visual hint (aka loading circle) might help in this situation.

		Good evening As geocaching.com let us know, it's the c:geo app, that seems to have an error/bug as it sets back the language settings on geocaching.com to english all the time. Sorry, but only part on this planet speeks english. Would be great if you could fix this. Thanks in advance Best Regards Grizzly70

		Open a cache, go to the description page. For demonstration immediately decrypt the hint. One or two seconds later the detail page is recreated and the hint is encrypted again (and the long description is hidden). Maybe setDataSetChanged() is called a few seconds after the first creation of the page.

		On Jolla (Sailfish 1.1.4.29), i can't authorize c:geo to use opencaching. When I press the &quot;Starte Authorisierung&quot;/&quot;Neustarten&quot;(=restart) button the web browser opens and asks me, if i want to authorize c:geo. I click yes, and openCaching remembers that c:geo should be authorized. The app itself still tells me it was not authorized to use opencaching.de

Here is a video showing the problem (provided by a user and published with his approval): https://www.dropbox.com/s/1v2i0xtq5z9ti8a/Offline.mp4?dl=0 Could be related to #4086

		I know we discussed this briefly somewhere. Now I crosschecked with current release and new relase candiate (with modified waypoint layout): On the current release 2015.03.31 pressing back while editing the waypoint discarded the changes. With 2015.05.29-RC pressing back will save changes made I think we should either adopt the old working mode (don't save on back) or preferably show a dialog with &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Discard&quot; options.

		Strangely with 2015.05.29-RC the user avatar is no longer loaded when using the function &quot;Check Login&quot; in Menu - Settings - Services - geocaching.com. With production release 2015.03.31 it is working normal (also tested today...so not website change related) Edit: Test with production release was done on another device (see comment from 03.06.2015). Log does not show any error.

		I installed 2015.05.29-RC and restored a backup of 2015.05.28-NB. After that I do see some caches on my list which have inventory icons (one or several TB numbered) but If I open the cache the inventory tab is not shown. The GC website confirms, that there are no TBs listed in this cache, still it keeps showing in the list even after refresh of the cache. Note: Tested for me with GC50HFV

When I select the &quot;show all&quot; from the android share menu provider then locus opens with the cache. This is surely a faulty way through the switch case of the onOptionsItemSelected of the cache details activity.

		On some devices cache icons are shown rather large, taking up much of the mapspace, especially when you have many caches in your lists (device tested on is Samsung Galaxy Note 3). Wish is to be able to switch between (eg) two different icon sizes - &quot;large&quot; (= todays icon size) and &quot;small&quot; (about half the size). This would be very helpful for better orientation on packed maps.

		People sometimes log spoilers that are not encoded. Encoding all non-encoded logs as they're fetched would allow users to check the recent logs to see if it has recent finds without accidentally having the cache spoiled.

		Im using C:GEO from weeks on my mobile (Huawei Ascend G510), and few days ago I installed C:GEO on my wife's mobile (Motorola Moto-E). She reported high battery usage of something, but I did'nt check that then. Last evening I fully charged up bettery of my Huawei and after night i realised that battery is almost empty again, and 40% of that consumption is caused by C:GEO (Using GPS). Durring night I had localisation switched to inacurate (GPS off), and C:GEO was not closed (was not on screen - is there any &quot;exit&quot; button?) I tried to set diferent options in C:GEO (use or not Google Play Services, save or not battery when sleep mode etc.) and C:GEO is showing on screen`s bottom that GPS is off but it didnt helped ... battery usage menu in android is still schowing huge consumption of C:GEO app and its consumed by GPS C:GEO that im using is version: 2015.03.31 On Huawei im using Cyanogen Mod 11 - Android 4.4.4 On Moto-E my wife is using Branded by Motorola Android - I guess its 4.4 or something. Regards Albert

		2015.06.03-RC1: I had several GPX imports on my device for lab caches and custom made caches (not refering to a known geocode). I would not expect, that these caches are checked towards GK or GKM for inventory as these geocodes are not supported for carrying GKs. 15:51:39.327 Debug cgeo 11463  [ModernAsyncTask #5] GeokretyConnector.searchTrackables: wpt=LABYRINTH-FESTUM

		I just recognized that we did not yet officially publish the send2cgeo script for OC. While thinking about how to do that, I had the idea that there might be no need to have to seperate scripts but just one which triggers for both websites. Is that technically possible? Having a combined script would minimize the effort (one version handling, one send2cgeo.html page on the website, etc.).

		It is good that we can use corrected coordinates made on the GC Cache page in PQ's or updated when refreshed (The little red indicator makes these very visible on the map. It would be nice if all corrected coordinates from PQs had this indicator without the need to refresh in c:geo. I also make a lot of notes on the GC cache page. In GSAK, these notes are available through the 'GcNote' database field. It would be a great feature to be able to see this data when viewing the cache in c:geo. Is this possible?

		While using the Play Console I noticed a new offer to use a cloud test service. From what I have read it offers free testing on 20 physical devices and provides a report back to the developer account. It is combined with the alpha/beta channels on GooglePlay (so tests will probably run as soon as an APK is placed there). That could be a useful additional test (although I am not sure how deep this service can test by using random clicks in the app). There is a possibility to &quot;early sign up&quot; for this upcoming service. Shall we do that? https://developers.google.com/cloud-test-lab/ http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/05/google-announces-the-cloud-test-lab-a-free-automated-testing-service/

		There seem to be many users (judged by the amount of support mails and bad GooglePlay ratings) having stability problems with c:geo after upgrading their devices to Android 5.0.x. This seems to be an issue which is maybe independend of #4921 For some of them the problem seems solved after a factory reset, but a lot others keep having problems. I have the chance to get a Sony Xperia Z3 tomorrow and will try to see if I can reproduce the general instability. @rsudev What was that device you are using? Did you see any regular crashes of c:geo on it?

		As discussed on IRC: I would like to test if requesting a larger heapSize in our manifest could help minimizing the OOM problems (caused by large bitmaps and mapsforge library) for the time being. I am aware it is no solution but still maybe helpful until we get more memory optimizations (like e.g. a new mapsforge library). Reference: http://developer.android.com/reference/androi/R.styleable.html#AndroidManifestApplication_largeHeap I suggest to change it on master and do some comparisons on some devices.

			<description>
		Taken from #5007: Reason: With the new webpage we link directly to mater on cgeo/cgeo repository. Having a separate repository for send2cgeo would allow Separate bugtracking Having branches for release/master separate to c:geo app =&gt; Allowing a separate release management for the script without need for any other hosting,etc. So, here would be my proposal:  (Merge #5045 - if ready to merge) Create a dedicated repository for send2cgeo in organization cgeo Change @updateURL and @downloadURL in script Change URLs on web page Raise version number of script Place the new version of the script to the old URL https://send2.cgeo.org/send2cgeo.user.js for a last time Will this work? Who could support this by creating the new repo (this won't work easy with UI only).

		Hi. It is a kind of usability improvement. When I click a cache on map that is already stored on some list I wish to have &quot;MOVE&quot; button. I do not need to click &quot;More details&quot; then, in order to move cache from one list to another.

		Hi, For personnal reasons I use 2 differents gc.com accounts. My request is to: store these 2 differents accounts in c:geo simultaneously provide an easy way to swicth between them. Notes: the best I think is to ask/select the account to use at c:geo startup this need of several &quot;c:geo profils&quot; on the same device may be usefull for other c:geo settings (for instance background color ...) don't forget to manage other &quot;linked&quot; accounts like (geokrety, GV vote ...): some accounts could be shared between these new &quot;c:geo profils&quot;. What do you think?

		the description of a multicache contains a list of waypoints (e.g. http://coord.info/GCY803) I can't find a way to copy coords of a station to waypoint - longpressing text select the whole text for copying to clipboard or for translating. finally I solved my problem using an external file to select described coords and copy to waypoint - this last part then worked great for me.

		From support mail: Some applications (like GSAK and Garmin tools) support a compressed GPX format named GGZ. While this officially is a propriertary solution for Garmin devices, it seems to be just a zipped GPX with a small folder structure inside (containing a XML file specific to Garmin(?) and a normal GPX). As it seems to be a valid ZIP archive, might it be possible to enable c:geo to import that on the same way as GPX (and zipped GPX). Advantage for the user: Have only one small file valid for his Garmin and c:geo (which is in fact the same device=Monterra). Example file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xbl6ma64f6dcpg2/test.ggz If you just remane that to *.zip you will be able to open it.

		Some cache links from opencaching are sent suing the internal cache id instead of the waypoint (geocode). With the OKAPI-method 'by_url' it is possible to resolve those as well.

		It would be cool if c:geo could import comments from GCComment. Since I am not a Premium Member at Groundspeak anymore, it has become indispensable for me. But I always missed the the sync of them to c:geo. GCComment GCComment is browser extension for managing your personal cache notes for basic and premium members (option to sync them with GS's personal notes). It also advantages compared to GS's personal notes: no char limit, additional coords, ... I'm not initiator of the script, but I try to fix bugs and keep the development going. In my branch I've created a version with the possibility to share comments as links (gist based). This version is not ready for release yet (some little thing are missing), but it's working. The gist export could be basis for an import in c:geo. Links There are 3 types of links: single cache: http://gcc.lukeiam.de#gcc77f77058034820de51e1 (id starts with gcc and is 23 chars long) If you cut of the gcc from the id you get the gist id where the data is stored: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/77f77058034820de51e1 multiple caches: http://gcc.lukeIam.de#gccce2836e0154de67363c1f (id starts with gccc and is 24 chars long) Cut of the gccc from the id you get the gist id again: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e2836e0154de67363c1f static link to multiple caches: All other links change with each export, but the static links can be resolved to the last multiple caches export of the user. (If the user agreed with uploading his ids - It uses a little web service hosted on azure) http://gccs.lukeIam.de#23788787-7b74-459b-96b3-3773eca8f5a6 (other subdomain and id contains - and is 36 chars long) Use this id and call https://idresolver.azurewebsites.net/23788787-7b74-459b-96b3-3773eca8f5a6 and you will get a multiple caches id: &quot;gccce2836e0154de67363c1f&quot; Data The data is encoded in xml and can be parsed easily. See the links above for examples. Gist API Gist has an easy to use REST-API to download the data: https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/ c:geo integration It would be cool to support two methods: Import with qr code by url (using intent-filter?) Save the static url in the options and import frequently or on request I could write some java code to help, but I'm quite new to android. If you need more information or if I could help somewhere, let me know...

		Hi, I discovered, that when I go offline, nearby search feature is unusable at all. I would recommend showing 20 nearest caches from local storage with warning that it's only from local storage, because internet connection was not sucessfull. What do you think about this ? Sometimes it will help users with many lists of caches, to just see what's around (using offline list with 3000 caches from pocketquery is difficult on many devices). Thanks for your opinion.

		This is somehow similar to #4074: 2015.07.18-NB Open GC2G9AJ or OCF19C &quot;Render view&quot; takes 30 seconds to complete because of: 11:44:55.261 Warning cgeo 22067  [network-5] Failure (30162 ms) GET http://team-jerichow.de/uploads/kurzlog4.JPG (ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.conn.ConnectTimeoutException: Connect to team-jerichow.de:80 timed out)
 Couldn't we do this in the background not blocking the UI? Looking back at #4074 I tend to remember that the unavailable pictures was not blocking the UI in the past but did &quot;only&quot; prevent all other pictures from beeing shown. So I would assume (although I did not explicitly test this before) that the blocking behaviour is new.

		I did not see this filter in an offline list : considering and filtering caches with zero found log (as possible FTF to do). Of course, this is the cache state according to the last refresh, but it's user responsibility to update it. I know this has been already asked with a marker on a map, but the cache details are not downloaded in this case, so it has no sense. But in an offline list, we have these logs. The filter would just check if there is at least one &quot;found&quot; log. What do you think about it ?

		From support mail (2015.07.08): Trying to add a fav to a cache with c:geo while there a no favorite points available on my account it returns a sucesful outcome and only after refreshing the cache I do see that the button again says &quot;Add&quot;. There is no error message This used to work i.e. a error toast is shown (I remember I tested it some months ago). Currently I have 12 favs remaining, maybe someone else can give it a try to verify this problem.

		The releasebranch contains quite some important fixes. Therefore I suggest to release after this weekend. I just built a RC version for me to test (and maybe to share on FB later on). Changes so far: Fix: Possible crash while editing personal notes Fix: Waypoints of caches may be missing on GPX import Fix: Crash if talking compass is started without target Fix: Request to gc.com tile server sent for caches from unknown sources Opinions?

		When I change the coordinates of a cache and choose to change it only locally a refresh of the cache erases that correction. This is for me not expected as I had chosen to keep that change locally. The waypoint itself which was created during that change is not removed and stays. Simular issue: If I import a cache with corrected coords from GSAK there is no additional wp created so after a refresh the corrected information is gone and not seen anymore within cgeo

		This might be more a question than an issue: Sine some weeks (cant tell the time where this behavior started) I do see a different behavior with c:geo in interaction with cache links. What I was used to: Start c:geo and do something Exit c:geo by pressing home button Open some webpage or an email which contains coord.info links and click on it to open it in c:geo Press back to return to the webpage/mail client What is different now: At step 4 I do not always get back to the appwhere I clicked the link but instead return to the session I started in 1.. Only if I repeatedly press the back button until I return to c:geo main menu and press once more on back to leave c:geo I get back to the originating app. Any thoughts whether I am wrong or what might cause the difference? To myself the old behavior was more user friendly: I click the link and see the result and can press back to return to where I came from. In parallel I would expect the ¨original session¨ to be kept in the background until I start c:geo itself again.

		When I export and upload my fieldnotes to gc.com I always get the popup-mesage &quot;upload to geocaching.com successfull&quot; - even if there is no internet-connection and nothing could be submitted. Sometimes the mobile data connection is not so good and I lost my fieldnotes this way. I can reproduce the bug when I disable wifi and mobile-data and try to upload the fieldnotes! Even an error-message-popup displaying for one second would not be the best solution because it is easy to overlook and there is now possibility for a second try because the last-upload-date was updated. But an success-message in case of failure is really bad.

If you select this point, I can see the cache and the log again, before I executing then this command. This function could be accommodated in the menu with the three dots on the main screen.

		Using the searchBar to open a cache/trackable AND validate using the keyboard, then coming back to the main activity. It's rather annoying to still have the searchBar open with keyboard shown.

		The other day for the first time since probably a year or so I wanted to change the log date of an entry. The upcoming date picker looks somewhat strange to me, as it does not contain an OK button (and even does not work at all on my device in my version, but that is another story). Does the date picker look and work as expected for you?

		2015.08.26-NB After implementing the new log sending progress prompts, there seems t obe an issue either in programming or at least in (german) translation: When sending a log with picture and GCVote I doo see: Sende Log und Bild (or similar) Bild wird gesendet Sende Bewertung It seems in step 1 only the log is sent, so the string or the general calling of this string should be adapted.

		It seems that the static code analysis in the IDEA/AndroidStudio configuration of our project is not running automatically. I have just been fixing unused imports Android lint warning nullable contradictions All of those should be found in IDEA/AndroidStudio too, without explicitly running an analysis, i.e. during normal compilation. Can one of the experts for those tools please check? Take 17dac8a for reproduction and the following 3 commits to see the violations shown in Eclipse.

		It seems that c:geo does not update what it thinks it my current location after it has been started. Two things that happened yesterday: Start c:geo wth location still turned off Turn on location Wait until OsmAnd sees me in my current location Select &quot;Nearby&quot;, &quot;Current location&quot; in c:geo c:geo selects caches on the wrong continent, it seems to use the previous location I have been searching... Later, I restarted c:geo. Then at least it had me in the right city, but Select a cache Click the circle with the four bars at the top, so that there's a circle filling it Walk around c:geo does not update my current location The &quot;location service&quot; icon does not even appear in Android's status bar. When I switch to OsmAnd, it does appear, and the blue spot follows my walking. This is using c:geo 2015.08.03 on a device without play services, but with open-source replacements for some of them. (Not that I think that matters, but who knows^^).

		This one is hard to describe, so I give you the sequence: 2015.08.28-NB Open a found mystery cache Create a new final WP and activate &quot;Set coords on webpage&quot;, save it Immediately go to the cache details page and press &quot;Add to favorites&quot; before uploading the coords to the website finished I can't exactly remember the reaction of c:geo but it was not OK. This leads to either a failure message for setting the favorite point or no feedback to the user for both actions. Sorry, happend already some days ago, and I wasn't able to reproduce as it needs quite a slow network connection. After refreshing the cache I have seen, that both operations have been sucesfull (coords set and fav point added). Not a big deal as the occurence will be quite rare.

		2015.08.30-NB1 It seems either there is a problem with event cache GC60RZK or it is not possible to add an event which is in the past? If this is intentional I vote for removing that restriction. The missing option is not really intuitive and it should be up to the user whether he wants to add an event in the past. Additionally there seem to be problems with users on some timezones (maybe erratically set on their phone) leading to fail to add it due to the missing menu.

		2015.08.30-NB1 Perform nearby search Result contains unsaved and saved caches Press home button to ¨exit¨ c.geo Open c:geop again The shown search result is now only containing the saved caches. Unsaved caches are no longer shown. I am not sure how it was in the past, but the fact that only saved caches are left is new to me. I assume, that either the list was still there or a the search equest was repeated.

		Groundspeak has asked us to remove gc-based address search, as they will get charged for that in the future (see mail in g+ developer group). Already since some time we primarily use Android or Mapquest for geocoding, but gc is still there as a fall-back.

			<description>
		Follow up of #5175 I wonder a little about this high amount of requests to mapquest mentioned in that issue depsite the fact that it is only the fallback option in a user initiated procedure. My assumption would rather be that this is not caused by geocoding for adress search but by the geocoding done for showing the current location on the start screen. This is more likely to happen than a user initiated search by adress IMO. In this case I suggest to remove the mapquest fallback at this place but keep it for adress search to maybe extend the 15000 limit.

		Long time ago I've contacted David, the GeoLutins owner, asking him if he agree with an integration of GL in c:geo. He replied yesterday, and was enthusiast. He proposed a simple API to lookup GL. He also added a GL[0-9AZ]{5,} pattern to lookup GL. The c:geo icon was added on his website just near this &quot;new GL numbers&quot; http://www.geolutins.com/profil_geolutin.php?ID_Geolutin_Selectionne=1976. Is there a problem with that? Main API url, is as of today: http://www.geolutins.com/xml/api.php?G=GLXXXXX There is also a converter from Tracking Numbers to GL numbers: http://www.geolutins.com/xml/decode.php?G=00000000-000 ( [0-9]{8}-[0-9]{3} ) I've done a proof of concept, I still need to clean a bit the code.

		As we do have some need to release some version soon (due to #5175 and #5177 and maybe due to #4921) let me just give some opinion from my side: The release branch contains only minimal changes with respect to the shutdown of opencaching.com and the geocoding things, whereas the master branch has a lot of new stuff. While I think that master is rather stable, I did not have any sufficient time and will not have until beginning of October to test it in deep (e.g. compass related). So although the gap between master and release is quite big and will get bigger until beginning of October I would still prefer a release from release as far as I am concerned for testing it. There could be one alternative if needed: If we could strip the compass related changed from master, the remaining changes on master could be made ready for release without too much effort IMO. What I want to say is, that the compass changes need to be carefully checked, as it is a core function but I would still like to see the bundle of other changes on masterto be out there rather soon. Happy to get your opinion on that...

			<description>
		Right now our main build is still Ant based, as that is supported in Eclipse, IDEA/AS and on Jenkins. I propose that after our current release we switch to a Gradle based main build and remove the Ant one. Reasons: More and more Android libraries are not packaged as JAR anymore, but as AAR only. For Ant or Eclipse based builds those have to manually be repackaged. I've done this since quite some time for the Google play services and similar libs in our repository, but this task is getting harder every time due to no easy identification of the right source artifacts, transitive dependencies, classes occuring multiple times in repackaged libs and so on. The (currently still experimental) Java to Dalvik bytecode compiler for Android requires Gradle. We can expect that tool chain to replace the Java to class to DEX to... toolchain of today in the near future. The current state slows down our adoption of other new technologies, e.g. lots of small libraries on github, which could easily be consumed with gradle, the most recent compat libs with Material design back port and so on. Of course this has consequences. I actually expect us not to be able to have a working compilation inside of Eclipse anymore due to it not understanding the gradle dependencies, thereby potentially requiring every Eclipse user of our developers to switch to Android Studio. I'd be happy about feedback of whether you feel we should take that step, especially if you are using Eclipse (like myself). I guess that we can replace additional functionality of our Jenkins build (coverage measurement and such) with gradle based functionality, but I'm a noob in Gradle. So this surely would require some team effort (and maybe lead to some days of Jenkins not building anything).

		While testing the RC version I noticed a big visual difference for basic members: While the nearby results looked like the saved lists in the past now every (unsaved or previously unloaded) cache will have orange circles. While this is technically correct it looks strange and users might be confused by that. What do you think? Here is how it looks:

			<description>
		With the redesign of cache overlay icons the textual note &quot;Offline&quot; has been removed. While this is OK in the search results (as the disk icon is shown) now the saved caches list does not have any indication, that those caches are stored for offline. While this is implicit and should not lead to any uncertainty, still some users of the RC version are confused by the missing &quot;Offline&quot; in the lists. I suggest to either introduce it again or also show the disk icon in the saved lists (while I prefer the first in order not to clutter the saved list by always the same overlay). Opinions?

		The title says it all.

		From support mail: While in waypoint adding the &quot;OK&quot; has been moved to the top the coordinate input window still ahas an &quot;Ready&quot; button at the bottom which might be blocked by the keyboard.

		From support mail (related to cgeo 2015.09.23): I received the latest update to c:geo last night and immediately noticed one problem: when I use the &quot;Live Map&quot; to view caches, even though I have all cache types selected, multi caches that I haven't found are not displayed . There are several night cache (which display as multis) that I have not saved for off-line use. None of these caches are displayed. I normally do not save night caches for off-line unless I intend to attempt them in the near future. Let me know if others have had this problem. I am using an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5). I cannot reproduce this (launch cgeo without any filter, live map, I can see multicaches, including in areas where I have no caches stored). Can other developers check if they can reproduce this problem?

If that's the case, it would be nice if the app could work in some fallback/compatibility mode.

		2015.10-04-NB (and also 2015.09.28): Store a multi or mystery cache to a list Open cache and go to waypoint tab Add a waypoint of type &quot;Final&quot; with valid coordinates Save the waypoint Return to the list Expectation: Cache icon should be shown with overlay icon on lower right for &quot;defined final&quot; instead of no overlay. The overlay does only seem to work if the function &quot;replace listing coords by final waypoint&quot; has been used while creating the waypoint. This should not be necessary for the overlay to appear in the list. I assume the bug was introduced with recent changes to the overlay design in lists as it used to work with older c:geo versions.

		My normal mode of operation for using c:geo is as follows: Use the map to find my area of interest. Scale the map to select an appropriate number of caches and store offline. Peruse the list for caches to target. Open the cache details Go to the logs and look at the recent ones to see when it was last found This is because where I live it isn't uncommon for a cache to go unfound for months and often the last years worth of logs are DNFs and/or needs maintenance. I usually will just skip these. It would be nice to have some sort of indication on the list page and/or the first details page of the last time cache was found and/or what the type of the last few logs are. My initial spit-ball of an implementation would be to have a colored/dashed line duplicating the colors from the last few log entries on the list page, one log per dash. Then that could be duplicated along with a last found date on the details page.

		2015.10.08-NB: Open Settings/Services Open GCVote settings Click on username and replace the existing user by an empty field Select OK Select &quot;Verify login&quot; This will return &quot;Check OK&quot; and I do see in the log that the previously stored username is still in use Close c:geo / Force close Start c:geo again Go to Settings/Services/GCVote You will see, that the previous username has been restored. As the username of GCVote and geocaching.com need to be identical we most probably derive it from the settings for geocaching.com. However couldn't we just disallow editing of the username in the GCVote settings and just show it for informational purposes.

		I have just published a cache. When I view the waypoints in CGEO they are jumbled up and are not being displayed correctly. The same waypoints are displayed correctly in the geocaching.com app, on the geocaching.com website and on my Garmin GPS unit. Just not correctly on CGEO. This is the cache: Le Chemin Secret GC64J9E To see the problem, first look at the cache on geocaching.com on a PC. Look at the second waypoint puzzle: Les Fenêtres . In the French part of the waypoint description, the coded waypoint is displayed correctly on the PC as : N 44° 05.2E1 E 005° 59.CDE. CGEO displays the same waypoint jumbled and incorrect as : N44°E005°05.2DD59.CD5 There is a similar problem with the remaining waypoints. Interestingly, the English waypoint description displays the waypoints correctly. This seems to be a big problem. Please advise! Thanks, Chris

		Tried the new GGZ format and it takes forever to load into c:geo. It cycled through 0-100% numerous times. It loads into my Oregon super quick, so is there an issue? Currently, I will revert to a GPX format for c:geo as I can only see a disadvantage.

		I suggest a &quot;Toggle&quot; (by pressing on the the text itself), between the approximate date and the actual date of &quot;stored in device&quot;. This way the current functionality is also preserved. Detail: I use my &quot;Stored in Device&quot; date as a way of knowing when I actually &quot;found&quot; the cache. (which I then log from the geocaching.com website) I do this together with putting the cache into a &quot;Found&quot; List. So displaying the date, instead of the approximation, would be invaluable for me, so I don't have to figure out which day I was at the cache location.

		From support mail: I use to import large GPX files (and sometimes several of them). Sadly while the import is running it does not show which file I am currently importing. This would be helpful in order not to accidently the same file again after a long importing time. So the name could be shown in the import window header or at least the &quot;import done&quot; window should state the file name which has just been imported.

		From support mail. A user performed an upgrade to Android 5.2 which was offered by Motorola for his device. Afterwards the compass of c:geo stopped working. I first advised to try the setting of using the orientation sensor...He reported back that it is not selectable. Other compass apps are working all the time before and after the upgrade. The sys info is as follows: --- System information ---
Device: XT1032 (falcon_retde, motorola)
Android version: 5.1
Android build: LPB23.13-56
Cgeo version: 2015.09.28
Google Play services: disabled
Low power mode: inactive
Compass capabilities: yes
Rotation sensor: absent
Orientation sensor: present
Hide own/found: false
Map strategy: detailed
HW acceleration: enabled (default state) 
System language: de_DE 
Geocaching sites enabled:
- geocaching.com: logged in (Login OK) / Premium
 Installed cgeo plugins: none
--- End of system information ---
 @samueltardieu Is it really possible that the device does not provide rotation sensor but only orientation?

		Right now we the master branch looks stable to me. So we could use the opportunity to release from master. However there are some issues which seem to be a regression out in the field still unsolved: #5240 #5225 #5264 #5262 #5296 #5312 #5390 So ideally these should be solved before release. Opinions?

		Now when I'm trying to select and copy some text from cache description, I have only upper bar with &quot;Copy&quot; and &quot;Share&quot; buttons. So, the first problem is - I cannot select custom text from description. Then, when I click &quot;Copy&quot; button it copies all the raw content with HTML tags and so on, so it's really useless in such form. Suggestion to copy only meaningful text.

		A lot of people contacted support mail because of this. The problem started after update to a newer version of this mapy.cz app, however I sill want to share this here as I don't know whether mapy.cz has a bug or we do use a special implementation for this app which is no longer valid for some reason now. Here is a good problem description from support. I have set as secondary navigation external source - application mapy.cz. The connection between c:geo and mapy.cz worked well until last big update of mapy.cz. Now, when I want to show cache in mapy.cz, it doesn't work. Through c:geo is opened application mapy.cz, but coordines are no shown (this worked before). It only works when I copy coordinates in format DD.DDDDD from c:geo to mapy.cz and I have to change &quot;,&quot; for &quot;.&quot; because it is copied from c:geo with &quot;,&quot;, but it doesn't work in mapy.cz with &quot;,&quot;.

		Current market version 2015.10.30 and current master (NB): Open a saved cache without waypoints Add a new waypoint of type &quot;Stage with question&quot; (others might produce the problem as well, however &quot;Reference point&quot; is working) Enter the note (NoteA) for this waypoint in the note field Save the waypoint Verify that the waypoint is stored and the note is shown correctly Add another waypoint of type &quot;Stage with questions&quot; Enter the Note (NoteB) for this waypoint in the note field Save the waypoint Result: Both waypoints shown with correct coords but both waypoints show &quot;NoteA&quot;, the string &quot;NoteB&quot; is lost.

		Thanks for the app! Recently, I was thinking about a new feature. Usually, I save the geocaches for one city before I go for hunting. After a while, many caches are in a list and many of them I saved weeks ago. It would be nice have a button to reload all saved geocaches and make the description up-to-date. At the moment, you have to click on each individually to update them.

		Folllowing info from support mail (and I have also seen this happening once in a while). It seems that the process is triggered which should merge the notes between local and server although there is no server communication involved. Here is the info from support mail: Problem's scenario: save a cache offline, add a personal note, save it and leave the cache return to the cache with the previously saved personal note re-edit the note (change some stuff, perhaps use copy 'n paste) and save it --&gt; the personal note is duplicated, with a &quot;--&quot; line between the copies Most sadly this is not deterministic. And although I tested and checked a lot, I cannot say which steps lead to this behavior, nor which conditions &quot;must&quot; be fulfilled to let it happen. Moreover it does not happen with every cache, but if it happened once, it happens every time I change the note of this cache. What I can say: It does not matter if I have previously uploaded the personal note or not; it does not matter where the cursor stands in the text; it seems to not matter if I use copy 'n paste or not.

		As listed in #5251 the master branch is not yet ready to release. However I just noticed that we still have the Moto G compass problem pending in the field and resolved on release. Therefore I just produced a RC version to give it a basic test with the goal of releasing it tomorrow. Any objections to a release (not sure what is going on on master at the moment which might be important for release).

		Does anyone have experience with c:geo on an Android 6.0 device? From support mail: My &quot;guess&quot; is that &quot;something&quot; within my recent update to Android v6.0 Marshmallow has changed how the state of Google Play Services &quot;appears&quot; to the C:Geo app. (appears to be disabled). [...] MAPS and CALENDAR seem to work fine...........but C:Geo still displays &quot;GPS disabled&quot; when I have your System/Use Google Play Services enabled (checked). So I'm &quot;guessing&quot; that Play services may well be active, but it appears to C:geo to be disabled. Alternatively, there may be something unique about my Android v6.0 and Nexus 7 (2013) which is disabling c:Geo's access to that service. Who knows?

		Found this strange issue during Russian localization testing. Here is the test case: Store a cache for offline use. Open Cache details Slide to page with Waypoints or Images Press button with 3 dots Press 'Personal notes&quot; Enter some text Press &quot;OK&quot; Application will crash. Some notes: The case is not reproducible from Description or Details or Logbook pages, only from Images and WP I found that I cannot add a personal note to a cache if it wasn't stored. Button &quot;Personal notes&quot; just does nothing. I assume this as a separated FR to allow to write personal notes for non-stored caches (or add error message for such case) My phone is Xperia Z3 Compact, Android 5.1.1 C:geo 2015.11.29-NB1-a4faa8b

That is not possible with the filters. When I use filters, I see ONLY Tradis, ONLY Multis, ONLY Mysterys, ONLY Events etc. But better solution: I see Tradis, AND Multis, AND Events, NO Mysterys. or I see Multis, AND Mysterys, NO Tradis etc.

		Yesterday it was cold (~0°C and windy). Since I don't have gloves for touchscreen use I got cold fingers while using cgeo - I don't like cold fingers. So thinking about how it could be possible to use cgeo with gloves the motion sensor came into my mind: For CacheDetailView: tend to the left / right ^= wipe to the left / right tend to the top / bottom ^= scroll up / down For Map: maybe we can add crosshairs which can be moved by tending the phone. to select fast move forward and back. But this can also be added later. For Lists / mainmenu: highlight the current selected item. move selection by tending the phone. select in the same way like map-select. Back: fast move left / right.

		..or improve it to make it more reliable. Several users contact us regularly having problems with strange waypoints automatically created by parsing of the personal note. There seem to be cases, where we parse nonsense. One example I received today: Personal note content:    A=6 B=0 C=5 D=4 E=13

   N 48° 53.(A*C*E)+194   E 009° 11.((D*71)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.(6*5*13)+194  E 009° 11.((4*71)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.(390)+194     E 009° 11.((284)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.584           E 009° 11.283
 c:geo creates the following waypoint as parsing result: N 48° 53,000  E 006° 00,000
 This means users might see a lot of incorrect waypoints on their map without a possibility to permanentely remove them. So I suggest to either improve the parsing or add an option to disable it in general so that affected users have a solution.

The other visible area remains in it's old drawing or a gray rectangle was visible. I made two screenshots: 2012.12.06-NB-d90449f I don't know what causes the issue and I can not reproduce this @ home. :(

		When tapping on the owner name in the cache listing view, you can already call by context menu the Groundspeak web site to send a private message to the cache owner. While running with bad internet connection throw the forest and not liking to load a web page first, it would be nice to be able to type in the message content directly in the c:geo app and the app will automatically send it via Groundspeak to the owner. Also nice then, if the app will show a prefilled edit box with {cache owner name}, {cache name}, {GC code} and {my nick name} in the following format: Hello {cache owner name}, “{cache name}” ({GC code}). Regards, {my nick name} So you can directly post your concerns, without coping or typing boring standard content.

		In order to untangle the current mess with changed waypoint descriptions and such, I would suggest to separate the waypoint description as loaded from the source (website, OKAPI, gpx) from the user additions. Than we can clearly detect website changes and update the local waypoint accordingly without endangering user-entered data. As a migration path I would suggest to treat the current description as user supplied and remove if it is identical to the website description on next update. Comments?

		I disabled the GC.com service (because they banned me for linking to an OC listing in a log), but I still do have the Pocket Queries menu entry. Strange enough, it also successfully loads pocket queries ... (whut?) Menu items that make only sense for the commercial locked-in service from overseas should be hidden if only open services are enabled.

		We fixed our dependencies to only use AssertJ 1.x, as 2.x is not compatible with Android. Since the latest release 2.3 it might be compatible again: http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-news.html#assertj-core-2.3.0, so we should try using it.

		I suggest we exclude the dedicated website tests (where each connector is tested one time) from normal unit testing. Benefit: Continuous integration testing on code changes is not affected by websites being down (e.g. OC.es right now). Drawback: We might take longer to notice parser issues after website changes, depending on how often we look at failing website tests.

		The caches I have stored at the device are organised in folders. For some specific folders I still want to keep the caches on the device, but as I'm running slowly out of memory (who thought, 640 kB won't be enough for some time :-P), I would like to delete all pictures from caches in any specific folder. It's maybe a quite strange request, but maybe somebody else would support this request ;-).

		...but make it depending on the sum of caches on that list. Quite often user complain that they are unable to refresh all saved caches. Reason is always, that this menu item is hidden on the all caches list indepently of the number of caches on that list. This &quot;feature&quot; was initially introduced to avoid unnecessary refresh of a large amount of caches. However I have seen many cases where users have something like e.g. 6 lists with 5 caches each and would like to refresh all 30 on the all caches list which wont work but require to seperately refresh each list. I instead suggest to use a hardcoded limit for the amount of caches on the &quot;All caches&quot; list where the &quot;refresh all&quot; option is hidden. My suggestion would be &gt;500 caches and not to simply hide the option but display a info toast when it is selected. On other lists there should stay no restriction. Another option would be to allow it on all lists but only present a warning if the amount of caches is &gt;500. Opinions?

		The current number of caches shown for each available PQ is just the maximum number of caches this PQ would theoretically deliver, but is not corresponding to the actual amount of caches within the PQ. We should: Leave it blank for PQs which do not have a GPX file to download Use the real number of caches for those who have a GPX available (listed as &quot;Waypoints&quot; on the &quot;PQ ready to download&quot; tab of the webpage)

		When using store Offline menu from CacheListActivity, a popup called Refresh all is shown. I'm not refreshing any caches, but storing new ones. This is a bit confusing. The message is displayed even if I choose to store only one cache. I think it's related to PR #5381. Subject: Refresh all
Message: This action may lead to high network traffic. Are you sure you want to batch refresh all caches?

		2016.01.21-NB This is for sure a subjective impression, but for me the previous implementation with showing a dialog after clicking on a PQ name was ¨failsafe¨ and intuitive. WIth the new implementation users might miss to understand that clicking on the name and clicking on the icon triggers different things. I don't know why Ihave this feeling, maybe because the icon does not really look clickable. I would honestly prefer the old implementation. Opinions on that?

		from facebook: Does cgeo automatically decode encrypted logs? I have permanently encrypted a log entry on one of my caches as it gave clues to the cache location. On the web page the entry appears encrypted but cgeo shows it in plain text. GC59E5Z, log entry for 27 Aug 15 This is because we use the &quot;Decrypt&quot; button functionality when fetching logs. It should be possible rather easily to instead fetch the non decrypted JSON. I'm just wondering if we would need a new database column for log entries. To my mind it should in principle not matter for our app whether the stored log text is actually encrypted or not. Clicking it in the UI will just toggle, independent of whether we known its state. Am I right with that concept? If so, we could probably just pimp the JSON parser.

		Since the last update I get an error message when I retrieve a TB from a cache. I click on the TB in the cache listing, select &quot;Retrieve&quot;, enter the tracking code from the TB and hit send. I always get the message &quot;it seems your log was not posted. Please check it on the originating website.&quot; However, the operation DOES succeed - the TB ends up in my inventory. A friend using cgeo gets exactly the same result, so it's not just me. I'm running 2016.01.19 I get the same result on a Sony Xperia Z3 running 5.1.1 and a Nexus 7 running 4.1.2

		The finals of a Letterbox and Wherigo Caches could have other coordinates as the header coordinates from their listings. So it should be possible to enter these coordinates so that g:geo treat them as header coordinates. At the moment it is also possible to send these coordinates to geocaching.com as corrected coordinates for the listing. These seems to be a breach in the website. The impementation of this feature request is a simple one-liner in the source file EditWaypointActivity, in the current revision the line 207 have to be changed.

If I use it for ie 10 caches all is OK. If I use it for ie 200 caches, I haven't tab Listing in Locus. I guess there is some limitation in the amount of data we can hand over?!

		Hi! Im on 2016.02.19-NB-7025585 and I use the personal note to store the variables from the stages of a multi cache. (just local on the device durring Caching, no upload) So I switch between listing. Map, koordinates in the listing and the personal note. After a few stages I noticed that the entries have been doubled! -See the screeshot. I know this behaviour, I experienced it month ago, but I thought this has been fixed?!

		Expected behavior and actual behaviour: cgeo refreshes the current list after moving the cache to another list. For dynamic lists this leads to an empty list after the move operation. Steps to reproduce the problem: search nearest, with some of the results already being stored move a stored cache from the results to another list via context menu

		Right now it is impossible to tell if a trackable opened from search is either travel bug or geokrety or geolutin. As far as I can see the &quot;type&quot; line might distinguish coins (if travel bug connector), books (if geokrety) and similar, but it does not tell which company/website manages this trackable. As there are users which don't want to register at all sites, we should make it possible to recognize very easily to which site/brand this trackable belongs. @kumy maybe this is of interest for you, since you changed a lot around trackables?

		According to the latest Groundspeak release notes they are conducting a test where 50% od users do receive the search view as landing page (when logged in) instead of the default page. I am wondering if this has any consequences for c:geo. Can all of you check what page you receive when opening http://www.geocaching.com and if you have the new behaviour do some smoke tests with your account in c:geo? Not sure however if this test is bound to 50% of users or 50% of calls to the URL...

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open a saved cache Create a waypoint, select to change coords locally to listing coords Refresh the cache Actual behaviour after performing these steps: The local change is lost and replaced again by the listing coords retrieved during refresh Expected behaviour after performing these steps: As the user defined change was done, it is not correct that this data is lost by refreshing. Not all users will understand this in beforehand and loss of data will appear. Version of c:geo used: 2016.02.23-RC Is the problem reproducible for you: Yes Attach system information if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System): Not relevant Other comments and remarks: Follow up of #5439 Comment by @blochi79: Now we have a follow problem. ;-( The local header coordinates are overwritten if the cache is refreshed. The method for refreshing a cache needs also to be adapted for the case that the local header coordinates have been corrected. Then the original coordinates in waypoints must be updated with the Listing coordinates instead of the header coordinates. [...] I often perform bulk refresh of mixed lists that contains also traditional caches. In this case I don't want to lose the corrected coordinates of letterbox or Wherigo caches. I did not know that it is the default behavior of c:geo to overwrite the local corrected coordinates with the listing coordinates. I think the current issue can be closed and the behavior of overwriting corrected coordinates while refreshing a cache may be discussed as subject of another issue. Sorry for the confusion.

		OpenCaching supports cache descriptions in multiple languages. c:geo should request one in the user's language. It looks like this is already supported (#4559 + #2512), but not when you forced English in c:geo's preferences.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: For some reason (maybe as I used c:geo on several devices and authorized them) Twitter denies posting a tweet via the API This seems to be indicated by a 403 error (see attached log Actual behaviour after performing these steps: No special UI indication. Twitter still shown as authorized in settings Expected behaviour after performing these steps: This should be detected (if possible), the user notified and the stored authorization should be revoked Version of c:geo used: 2016.02.03 Is the problem reproducible for you: Yes (under the mentioned conditions) Other comments and remarks: Log: 22:09:15.248 Warning cgeo 7216  [AsyncTask #5] 403 [Forbidden] (403 ms) POST https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open s saved cache Go to the waypoint tab Start creating a new waypoint Tap on the coords to open the input dialog Start moving from your position so that your own coords are changing Press the &quot;Own coordinates&quot; button repeatedly to obtain updated coords Actual behaviour after performing these steps: The coords are never changing in the input dialog, You have to leave the dialog and open it again to get an update. Expected behaviour after performing these steps: The button &quot;Own coordinates&quot; should update the fields with the actual coordinates. Version of c:geo used: 2016.03.10-NB (but probably since we introduced the new input dialog) Is the problem reproducible for you: Yes Attach system information if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System): Other comments and remarks:

		I just tried to post a release notification via cgeo/status (which we obviously missed for the current release). The CI job reports a success but status.cgeo.org does not reflect the update. Looking into the CI console output I do see: Warning: Couldn't read data from file &quot;/srv/statusSecret&quot;, this makes an empty 
 That is likely the reason. @samueltardieu

		Just a reminder for me to test this and maybe clean install before retesting. I noticed today with 2016.03.14-NB that cgeo is laggy in responding to clicks. Especially after pressing the three dot button in cache details or popup may take a few seconds to open the menu.

		In order to optimize the usability of the possibility to have a cache on more than on list: Instead of the new multiple buttons for ¨Remove from list¨ couldn`t we just make the list selection dialog checkbox based and keep the remaining UI elements on cache details as they have been before? IMHO this would have some advantages: Moving a cache from one list to another currently got more complicated than before No cluttering of buttons on cache detals page Simultanous storing to multiple lists possible in one dialog Doing it like this would also bring it more into the direction of the discussed ¨tag¨ strategy

Yes Other comments and remarks: Since there are many other services suppoted besides geocaching.com, the user should be able to choose a service when setting up their geocaching account. Currently the setup only allows geocaching.com, other services have to be set up manually and there is no option to choose them after installation.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: There are numerous users on support mail, who have graphical problems and stability problems. All of them have in common: They either have a new device with Android 6.0 or recently upgraded to Android 6.0 In all system informations I do see that HW-acceleration is switched off (HW acceleration: disabled (manually changed)) After enabling it, the problems are gone Expected behavior after performing these steps: The users do say that they did not manually change this setting before. Is there any problem in the code, which may lead to the effect, that it is disabled on Android 6.0? Is this setting contained in any (google) backup and might be wrongly restored on a users new device? Version of c:geo used: 2016.03.06.

		Actual behavior after performing these steps: With the new authentication menu the password field is empty when accessing the reauthentication screen. The user has to reenter his password in order to check it. Expected behavior after performing these steps: The old 'Check Login' function is a procedure well used in my support mail activity and also AFAIR in our FAQ. I would like to see that the old password is kept here, so that we can instruct the user to check the login without the need to enter the password again.

		https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits I'm in favor of only allowing squash merging. That way our history no longer contains &quot;sprinkled&quot; commits, if someone worked over multiple times and commits on a feature that was later merged via pull request (and where some other commits where done over the same time span on master). (The problem isn't that big in our repository, since most of the time there isn't much overlap. At work we are pushing up to 200 times per day on my current project in multiple parallel feature branches, and developers basically got insane trying to read the history before we activated cherry-pick-merging in our gerrit review system) What's your opinion?

		Right now we include the resource strings for all languages from the library projects that we use. We should only include the languages that we actually maintian in the app, to make the libraries and the app use the same language (and not have translated library things, where there is no translation in the app). Note to everyone maintaining the translations: This change requires that newly added languages are explicitly added to build.gradle.

		Feature Requst/Suggestion: A configuration option could be added to define, if a cache should be move to a specific list right after logging it (offline/online). The target list could either be a configurable one, or a fixed/predefinged one that is supposed to contain finds (when logging online) or caches to log online when doing offline logging. After moving the cache to the target list, it would be removed from all other lists.

		As originally posted in #5603 👍 Wouldn't it be meaningful to reuse the (already translated) string for &quot;Create account&quot; as it was used in the upper menu before instead of creating a new one which will again need translation? 👍 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Enable extremcaching.com Search nearby caches From the result list open a EC cache Go back to the search results Actual behavior after performing these steps: The cache which was just opened and closed is shown as saved (icon overlay) in the search result list. Entering the details again it is shown to be saved to the default list, but it can not be found there and it should not be saved at all. Expected behavior after performing these steps: Don't show it as saved. Version of c:geo used: 2016.04.03-NB Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: Does not happen for GC or OC as far as I could test but I am not sure.

		With the fix for #2281 it was introduced that c:geo is aborted on log.e when debug mode is active. It might happen that users claim such events on support. Having that cause in mind it would be good if the current setting could be included in the system information in About c:geo -&gt; System like: Debug mode active: Yes/No 👍 1

		Hi, we started use Coverity for analyse code at work. This tool is also available for open-source projects. For more information: https://scan.coverity.com/github I was wondering how much bugs it will found for cgeo application. I tried it on assembleDebug target and it found only 49 defects in code. So thanks, you are doing great job ;) If you agree cgeo can use coverity time to time (it can be executed in periods). And we can fix these issues ;) This tool use famous project like python, perl, ruby and another ...

		This is a feature request. It would be great if the running c:geo could appear above the android lock screen. In this way, you could reach the already running c:geo without unlocking the device. I saw similar feature in Locus and Cachebox. This feature can be switched on/off in these apps. Thanks.

A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es)
failed:

support@cgeo.org:
SMTP error from remote server for RCPT TO command, host: mail.cgeo.org (193.95.241.239) reason: 550-X-Warning: 212.227.15.14 is listed at dnsbl.sorbs.net (127.0.0.15:

 Anything we can do about that? They reached us now, so the problem might have been temporary...but still I don't know.

		From time to time users complain, that texts and symboles on OSM-Online maps are too small to read on a high res device. Locus does support a selectable scaling option for that problem. c:geo could have the same. AFAIR the setting for &quot;Increase text size&quot; does also only work for offline maps...am I right?

		We have 3 build jobs, which already differ slightly in the (script) code they use. I want to avoid that. At work we have solved this by having just one real build job, which is parameterized and all other jobs then trigger this one with a set of matching parameters. However, that has the drawback that this single job is run in different contexts, leading to jumps in every graph you create from the build. Therefore I'm thinking that we should only extract the main shell script part from all the 3 jobs. If we create another job just for this script, and then execute it in the workspace of the calling job then we should be able to have all other things remain as before, but still avoid the code duplication. Other ideas?

		This is a feature request for the possibility to allow personal notes waypoint import after changing the personal notes. Use case example: Go on a multi cache hunt Store the cache locally Write down A, B, C, etc. in the personal notes section of the multi cache Calculate the final coord by switching between personal notes and a calculator app back and forth. When done, you have the final coord written down in your personal notes. Now you have to swipe left twice and hit the &quot;Add waypoint&quot; button to add the final coords. The little window opens and you have to put in the numbers. My personal problem here is that I can't kepp more than 5 numbers in mind, so I enter the North coordinate, hit the tick symbol, go back to personal notes, read the East coord, go back to waypoints and enter the East coordinate. (You see, this workflow works and the app does what it should, but it could be easier for the user I think.) Expected behavior: I personally see two possible improvements: Expect the app to parse my personal notes after saving for something like &quot;Final: N 47.123 E 8 33.123&quot; and create the waypoint accordingly. Highlight the coord in the personal notes and allow the user by clicking on it to choose &quot;Add to waypoints&quot; or &quot;Update existing waypoint&quot;... something like that Version of c:geo used: Not relevant System information: Not relevant Other comments and remarks: I love caching and your app since 2011 - big thanks to you guys!

		Developers of c:geo, I have found that AsyncTask.execute has been widely used in the project. However, this API is relatively slower on devices with system version higher than 3.0 because &quot; AsyncTasks were executed serially on a single background thread&quot; for systems newer than 3.0. (This is found in the API guide) While using c:geo, users can easily trigger multiple AsyncTasks and influence the performance, so I think it will help to improve the performance by changing execute to executeOnExecutor to enable real multi-thread execution. Thanks a lot.

 I remember having seen this kind of exception before but it did not influence the app function. We might even already have this issue somewhere (but I could not find it). New is, that c:geo freezes. Is this related to the recently introduced &quot;Abort on log.e&quot;?

		Hello developers of c:geo, I have found that AlarmManager.set() is used in CgeoApplication to set a PendingIntent to restart the MainActivity in 0.5 seconds. But this API may not send the intent in time on devices newer than KitKat. As I found in API guide, alarm set by this API may be deferred sometime so that the activity will not be restarted in that small time interval as expected. Using API setExact will make sure to send the alarm at that exact time. Hope this information is useful for you. :) Thanks a lot.

		This is to collect feedback how to deal with the recent changes in the Android tool chain. Please refer to the 2.1 release notes described in http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/studio.html If I got it right, this means for us: We cannot use Java 8 due to the target level restriction. We can upgrade to Studio 2.1, this is still the same underlying IDEA version. We can upgrade the android gradle plugin to 2.1, since that will also work for other IDEs. We should try to enable the new experimental compiler (via PR), since I expect it to be more performant than the tools used before. Or do you consider this to be to unstable? Or do you currently use the Instant Run feature (which doesn't work with the new compiler yet)? We should switch to in-process-dexing for better performance (http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/gradle-plugin.html , section for release notes 2.1). However, that seems to require more memory than our current docker slaves are configured for. Shall we just try it nevertheless? Shall we go with 8 GB minimum RAM per slave? @samueltardieu and @kumy , would that still fit for you? Anything I missed or where I might be completely wrong?

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Have new map active as default Apply global type filter (e.g. Traditional only) Open live map Actual behavior after performing these steps: No filter info shown below the action bar Expected behavior after performing these steps: The notfication about an active filter should be shown directly below the action bar (compare to old map) Version of c:geo used: 2016.04.27-NB Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Attach system information here if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System)

		Disable all cache connectors (I had this by accident after a previous debug session). Search by address, search nearest etc. will return zero results. I suggest that we show an error message for each search, that does not directly lookup a geocode. Cause to my knowledge we only support geocode lookup with disabled connectors. We could also add a warning on the main activity where the login state is shown, but this would potentially be wrong forusers that want to cache completely offline (e.g. by means of importing GPX or whatever, but never using online search).

		Fork-off from the last 3 comments here: #5562 (comment) I suggest to render the log images below the log text as following: If it is one image, then stay as of now: (icon) (image title) For more than one image (e.g. 3): (icon) 3 images That takes away the necessity to have humans really read (and split) the concatenated titles. Since we open all images of the given log anyway, I also don't feel is any value in reading all the titles directly below the log text (instead of only in the image list). Opinions?

		Open map (new mapsforge implementation) Click on a cache to open the popup Activate the new heading line function (by clicking on the correponding icon on the top right of the popup) Heading line is shown and title is the correct geocache previously selected Click on the waypoint of a another cache (but not on the cache itself) Activate the new heading line function (by clicking on the correponding icon on the top right of the popup) Result: The heading line is updated correctly but the title still shows the cache which was selected in the first step (Problem does only occur for waypoint icons but not for cache icons)

		Due to #5718 I suggest (as also @banaweizen suggested within the issue) to have a shortterm bugfix release. Looking at the release branch I do only see this single change, which I consider not risky in terms of testing need. I have just build a RC version to crosscheck it (but I will have only very limited time). If nothing shows up in my smoke test I suggest releasing it this night or tomorrow morning. Second opinion please! ToDo: Set version code in changelog_release.xml Generate release version Tag release on Github Upload release to Github Rename &quot;Release branch&quot; milestone to release version Create a new &quot;Release branch&quot; milestone Publish release to Google Play (suggest 100% directly) Push notification as soon as available on Google Play

		I was told to ask in here and I have to admit I am out of my league in here, but I have a request/idea. I have the C:GEO app on a couple of devices. Is there any way to build pocket queries in GGZ format and either use them in the app or export them so they can be used in a Garmin gps? A lot of places I go geocaching does not have cell phone coverage and even though I could use the phone offline I find the gps to work better. I am also asking for bigger pocket queries than GS allows like whole states if needed. A lot of people are traveling and the size of pocket queries are very limiting and they don't want to be adding new ones all the time. Step 1 Step 2 ...

		This is a feature request. Detailed steps causing the problem: import a GPX file there was too little or no feedback when user clicked on GPX file, before import started. User does not know for certain if he/she clicked on the correct file or not. the import progress dialog is shown. This dialog shows a predefined message only. The user does not know which GPX file is currently importing. Expected behavior after performing these steps: the import progress dialog to show the filename of the GPX file being currently imported. Version of c:geo used: 2016-05-09 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes

		It would be very handy if one could select the shown cache type directly from inside the map view. This could be similar to how one currently can select the map source. As is now, one always has to exit the map, select the new cache type and enter the map again.

		I recently adopted a cache and when I open the listing in cgeo I still see the original creator of the cache as owner. It would be nice if you could change this to something like this: Created by (or Creator): name of original owner Owner (only necessary if different from above): name of current owner Thanks!

		Detailed steps causing the problem: creat an empty list import GPX file (with any number of caches, I tested with 100+) after import successful dialog, press ok press BACK from GPX files panel to return to list panel Actual behavior after performing these steps: list is shown empty click on lists dropdown shows an update for the &quot;all caches&quot; counter switching lists to all caches shows proper contents switching lists and then back to list into which I imported shows proper content Expected behavior after performing these steps: list to be properly populated after GPX import without the need of further user interraction. Version of c:geo used: 2016.05.09 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes, always System information: Android 4.4.2 (Huawei Ascend P7)

		Detailed steps causing the problem: appears to be identical to issue #4029 closed in 2014 Firefox 46.0.1 Greasemonkey 3.8 2-MAY-2016 Send2cgeo 0.34 16-MAY-2016 browser and device registered browse to geocaching.com, &quot;Play&quot;, &quot;View Geocache Map&quot; right-mouse click on cache to download, click on &quot;Send to c:geo&quot; &quot;Please Wait&quot; is displayed at top and never goes away, never processes the request Actual behavior after performing these steps: nothing happens once the &quot;Please Wait&quot; is displayed Expected behavior after performing these steps: cache should be downloaded with &quot;Success!&quot; displayed Version of c:geo used: 2016.05.09 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes, but it works fine with Chrome and Tampermonkey System information: Attach system information here if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System)
The issue is not with c:geo, but with the send2cgeo/Firefox script


##### Other comments and remarks:
Browsing to send2.cgeo.org with https produces a Firefox error:  &quot;The owner ... has configured their website improperly&quot;

		Detailed steps causing the problem: No problem =&gt; SUGGESTION Version of c:geo used:2016.05.09 System information: GT-I9305 Android 4.4.4 Other comments and remarks: Hint: it might be practical in c:geo to have a warning beep (or a ringtone of your choice) when passing near a geocache (with distance / adjustable radius). It would be warned when you are cycling for example. MyTrails (FrogSparks) does. I happened to export caches to MyTrails for that, but it's even more applications to run on the smartphone and it is not best for the battery (although I have a Powerbank ).

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Start downloading an online search result list Cancel at some point in between Actual behavior after performing these steps: The online search result list is refreshed and all caches have the offline marker. But in fact, not all have been stored. When randomly clicking caches from the list now, some open immediately, and some will be downloaded first (the ones we cancelled).

		From support mail: All worked well until I upgraded to Maps.me 6.0.7 Looking at a list of 40 caches and selecting &quot;Show on a map&quot;, then Maps.me There are 40 green dots around where I am standing, GOOD. I tap a dot. It comes up with box and words c:geo and the co-ordinates. I tap the arrow labelled &quot;Back&quot;, it then quickly shows a message that it cannot download cache details, and return to the list. The one nearest is top of the list. But I want to research other around and have no idea which is which Previously (before the Maps upgrade) it came up with the cache name, and if I did a back arrow, it then opened that cache's description. So it seems that the interchange parameters to Maps.me has changed with this new version. Please can you look into it? Android 4.1.1 C:geo 2016 05 09

		Hi c:geo team, Detailed steps causing the problem: Go into an offline list with tens of caches Go to the end (for example), select a cache, move the cache in another list by using the &quot;move&quot; button (or long press the cache, select &quot;move in another list&quot; choice in the menu) Actual behavior after performing these steps: After moving the cache, we are back to the beginning of the list Expected behavior after performing these steps: Stay to the last known position in the list before moving the cache Version of c:geo used: 2016.05.09 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Attach system information here if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System)

		Import the 3 lab cache GPX files from GC55555. Cache number 10 will always overwrite the existing cache number 10. This is because our GPX parser wrongly thinks that the &quot;10 - some name&quot; indicates the geocode 10, therefore overwriting the previously existing cache.

		I just noticed today that an event I attend regularly (&quot;Feuerbacher Cachermittagstisch XYZ&quot;) only shows &quot;Feuerbacher&quot; in the cache list, and has roughly the same width of empty space. We should use ellipsis=end to display more information there. The same might be useful in activity titles that display the cache name.

		I logged a trackable this morning at 6:10 German time. When I refreshed the trackable afterwards, it was shown logged yesterday. I had not changed the date selector, so I'm somewhat sure it was not set to yesterday. Might this be a problem with the time offset of -7 hours that we use somewhere? I can't verify this behaviour at the moment, since I have no private tracking code available. Will re-test one of the next days with my own trackables.

		Hi c:geo team, Detailed steps causing the problem: Go in Parameters -&gt; Maps For french translation, the same text appear on 2 lines &quot;Dossier contenant les cartes ho&quot; (not adapted to mobile width) cause translation too long. The rest of text is not written on the following line. Actual behavior after performing these steps: Cannot distinguish which line is for offline maps folder (yes, I know now that it's the first one by rotating the screen, but you don't know at the first time...) Expected behavior after performing these steps: Reduce french translations in cgeo/main/res/values-fr/strings.xml (not sure I have the right...) 1/ Offline maps folder : &quot;Dossier cartes hors-ligne&quot; 2/ Offline map themes : &quot;Dossier thèmes cartes hors-ligne&quot; Version of c:geo used: last Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Thanks, geo-regards, Tof

		IMHO the quite regular fails of this CI check for that site make the tests meaningless as probably no one will pay attention on those fail reports if they come in to often... Is that a real availability problem for that website...in that case I suggest to disable the tests for this site in order to be able to only get fails for real problems. 🎉 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open history Menu → Clear history Actual behavior after performing these steps: The caches in the history list are still shown. Expected behavior after performing these steps: The list should be empty. If you go back to the start screen and then again to the history, it will be empty. Version of c:geo used: 52db0cc

		The explanatory string given to the user right next to the setting of &quot;Debug mode&quot; active should include the note, that c:geo may run more instable when activating it (regarding abort on log.e). I will change the english string which should afterwards also trigger a string reset on Crowdin and force new translations.

		We should replace the name &quot;New map&quot; by something more understandable like &quot;Mapsforge Beta&quot;. Additionally the setting to enable it by default is way to long to fit on screen (at least the german translation). Here I would suggest &quot;Activate Mapsforge Beta Map&quot;. Any other suggestions?

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Step 1 - when working on a geocache county challenge it is sometimes hard to tell via the map what county the cache is in - especially if the cache is near a county line. Other comments and remarks: An added line of information stating rh county the cache is in would help those completing county challenges a lot.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Start c:geo Go to Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Services Note: No &quot;Active&quot; subtitle for geocaching.su Enter menu for geocaching.su Note: Subtitle of Activate item shows &quot;Load caches from geocaching.su&quot; Activate the item Actual behavior after performing these steps: Subtitle now shows &quot;true&quot;/&quot;false&quot; depending on the active state of the checkbox Additionally on leaving the menu the service list does not show &quot;Active&quot; for geocaching.su Only on leaving and reentering the settings menu the behaviour is correct again. Expected behavior after performing these steps: The subtitle within the geocaching.su setup should remain unchanged &quot;Active&quot; should be shown in the services overview menu Version of c:geo used: 2016.06.27-NB Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: @Bananeweizen

		Here are my settings in IntelliJ IDEA for the order of imports. It can be changed easily. In any case, Eclipse and IDEA users should use the same order to prevent imports from going back and forth every time a file is changed: import static all other imports

import butterknife.*

import cgeo.*

import all other imports

import android.*

import java.*

import javax.*
 with blank lines between every group if there is at least one element.

		Just found out that despite c:geo has offline maps support, it doesn't work with native maps.me maps which are in .mwm format. Steps: Install maps.me download some areas for offline use make sure they were downloaded in .mwm run c:geo, point to the folder with downloaded map files make sure no new maps were added to c:geo It really makes sense, because it's the default use case - download some maps from the mobile maps app and then use it in c:geo.

		I know you are not the mapsforge support team, but you have the &quot;Offline Maps&quot; feature, which I use very often (especially abroad), so I think I'll ask here. I figured out a long time ago where to get the maps, but I still struggle on how to apply Themes to those maps. There are pages that provide mapsforge themes, but I got them never to work in c:geo. Is there a source for these themes or could you at least include a few more themes? Mapsforge (v0.6.1) does not include any other built-in themes than the default. I don't know how many users actually use this feature, but I think it would be more users if the feature was more &quot;accessible&quot;. Some of the pages that give themes for free: http://www.openandromaps.org/en/legend/elevate-mountain-hike-theme http://openmaps.eu/mapsforgetheme Sidenote: I also found the thread (mentioned in the help here: http://www.cgeo.org/faq.html#osm-use-themes) where user @Lineflyer asks if he could use a theme, but most of the links seem to be dead: http://forum.locusmap.eu/index.php?topic=1753.0

		Detailed steps causing the problem: have cyanogenmod 13 (Android 6.0.1, see below) have current version of c:geo from google playstore try to start c:geo - and it immediately crashes Actual behavior after performing these steps: c:geo briefly shows main screen for half a second and then crashes Expected behavior after performing these steps: c:geo should start and either display main screen or setup screen for first install Version of c:geo used: current version from playstore (2016.06.09) Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Attach system information here if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System)
 Unavailable since I even cannot enter the main screen. Device: Samsung Galaxy S5 (klte), Cyanogenmod 13.0-20160717-NIGHTLY-klte Other comments and remarks: I used c;geo on this phone with cyanogenod 12.1 and it was all fine. Updated to 13 this week (clear install with wipe) and re-installed all apps from playstore. They all work fine but not c:geo. Reinstalled both the OS and c:geo but it still crashes while other apps (e.g. Locus) work fine.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Having GKM proxy enabled Open a GK which has been placed in a cache (like GKB988) Swipe to the Logbook tab Tap one of the geocode just behind the date Actual behavior after performing these steps: A toast say &quot;c:geo failed to download cache details&quot; Expected behavior after performing these steps: The corresponding cache should be opened (like done for TB) Version of c:geo used: master w/ #5847 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: N/A Other comments and remarks: The LogEntry only store cache name and GUID. In the case of GeoKrety, we don't know the GUID, only the geocode (or coordinates). This will also be necessary if cache is from opencaching (no guid info there?)

		Locus Maps Pro (with Geocaching add-on) adds a preview of what the 5 latest log types were when logs are available. This allows the geocacher to quickly determine if a cache might be worth it or if there is a good chance that the cache is not there anymore. We should do the same thing in cgeo.

		I propose to use the mobile version of Google translate in c:geo. Detailed steps causing the problem: Step 1 Open log of a cache Step 2 Long press a log in a forreign language. Step 3 Select to translate into your native tongue Step 4 Observe that you are taken to the desktop version of Google translate. Step 5 Append /m/translate to the URI path, prior to the GET varisbles, to go directly to the mobile version of Google translate. Example URI https://translate.google.com/m/translate?vi=c#auto/en/Der%20heutigen%20Tag%20begann%20wieder%20mit%20Sonne.%20Dies%20freute%20uns%20nat%C3%BCrlich%20besonders%2C%20da%20ein%20sonniger%20Cachetag%20wesentlich%20mehr%20Spa%C3%9F%20macht.%20Gem%C3%BCtlich%20starteten%20wir%20nach%20dem%20Fr%C3%BChst%C3%BCck%20und%20konnten%20auch%20heute%20wieder%20recht%20erfolgreich%20sein.%20Im%20Team%20mit%20Q3%20auf%20Tour%20gewesen.%20TFTC%20Gr%C3%BC%C3%9Fe%20aus%20Deutschland%20Orientexpress Actual behavior after performing these steps: Expected behavior after performing these steps: Version of c:geo used: Is the problem reproducible for you?

		Feedback from beta user: Icons instead of text buttons are nice as they are bigger and clearer, however IMHO the delete button is at the wrong place (also compared to where the textual buttons have been). I suggest to have only regresh in upper row and lower row should be edit left and delete right. This also helps in accidently not tapping delete instead of refresh.

		Right now, the status manager displays warning that a new release or release candidate is available and links to the Google Play Store regardless of how the user installed the application. We can retrieve the name of the application that installed the current application from the package manager. This should be sent along with the version code and the version name to the status manager at status.cgeo.org so that appropriate update URIs can be returned eventually.

		From support mail: I would like to describe you a small problem with sending coordinates to external applications (in this case mapy.cz). The problem is that when you send those coordinates, mapy.cz will only show a label (picture) without a pin with exact position (picture). And I would like to point out that it has to work offline as well. It would really make user experience better not only for me, but for many Czech geocachers. Keep up the good work! Thanks. 2016.06.09

		From FB and support mail: Navigating using maps.me from cgeo is no longer working (no target shown in maps.me). Happens if both apps are on latest available release, works again when downgrading maps.me to previous official version. So either an API change on maps.me which we need to follow or simply a bug of maps.me.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Upgrade Maps.me to 6.3.6 Actual behavior after performing these steps: Selecting &quot;Show on a map&quot; in C:Geo, and chosing Maps.me The map appears, but no caches come across Their cursor is stuck in the search box. Expected behavior after performing these steps: Full display of caches onto the map Version of c:geo used: 2016.06.16 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes, on two different Android machines System information: Android 5.0.2 Attach system information here if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System) 

##### Other comments and remarks:

Deleting Maps.me and loading version 6.2.5-Web  using their downloadable .apk file restores full functionality.

		The most recent beta releases of the android tooling require to accept licenses for the SDK components even on build servers. I've implemented this by our build script automatically writing the necessary file, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/38381577/44089 That works. However, I was wondering if other developers would prefer this to be part of our gradle script directly, to make it work everywhere, not only on CI? Might be more smooth, on the other hand I'm a bit hesistant to accept licenses on behalf of every user of our gradle script.

		I am using the offlinemap germany.map from http://ftp-stud.hs-esslingen.de/pub/Mirrors/download.mapsforge.org/maps/europe/ With zoomlevel 5-7 some tiles are left blank. Cause: some map segments of germany.map are to large. How to fix:  ReadBuffer.setMaximumBufferSize(6500000);
 For details see mapsforge/mapsforge#868 I am using c:geo version 2016.08.16 (dowloaded via fdroid-app) Germany (offline) Android-4.4.2 (api-19) in german language

		Feature request: add an option to bring back the old behaviour for the lists: each cache can only be part of 1 list. (an option, because I do understand the new way of handling lists and its advantages for lots of users.) Use case: create a pocket query (or run an existing one) and add the caches to a new list. A couple of days later you run the same PQ and also add those to a new list. So you get 2 lists with caches. Best after new caches became part of the new list, or other ones removed, etc. old behaviour: The new list has the number of caches included in the PQ, the old one only lists those caches that aren't included anymore (disabled, found, new caches made them disappear etc.) It is easy to look at those and decide which ones to keep or remove. new behaviour: You get 2 lists with no easy way of telling the difference. If you want to make sure you don't have caches on the device which are not useful anymore, you can only clear the old list. It is possible you clear caches that can still be useful for future trips. In my case I create one using pocket query creator every couple of days, or before I go geocaching, with only the 1000 closest enabled caches that are active and haven't been found be me. With the old behaviour I ended up with up to 3-4 lists with caches, I only had to remove those I found or were disabled. I do not log with c:geo on the device I have with me on trips, so found caches are not marked as found on that device and it also doesn't have an internet connection during trips.

When flipped back to original maps and cache location had moved to new corrected coords but going back the icons had swapped again. PS love the new Mapsforge much clearer detail.

Yes System information: Samsung Galaxy S7 Other comments and remarks: With the current RC version 2016.09.06-RC the multi window is working normally. @Bananeweizen I suspect the recent changes to the manifest could be the cause (remove mandatory touchscreen)?

		Sine this morning we get complaints about freezing/crashing live map. I can reproduce this after short usage of the live map. As it wasnt the case last days I assume we have a server issue one again (or still) where cgeo crashes instead of catching the error and giving a proper error message. Maybe someone can reproduce and provide a log. IMHO we should urgently fix this because people blame cgeo for this.

		We regularly get such crashes fro Android 6.0 and 7.0 devices. I could reproduce it by denying location access for c:geo in the app settings. Perhaps we should try to expect this, capture it and inform the user accordingly. java.lang.SecurityException: Client must have ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission to request PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY locations.

		Sometimes I store caches one by one from the live map. Every time I have to select the same list(s) again and again. Previously we had the &quot;ask for list&quot; option, now I suggest to add an option to remember the last list selection for storing a cache. This is somehow related to the requested long-press in #5839 as it removes the additional work for selecting a list.

		Starting October 15th, application with no explicit android.hardware.location.gps use in the manifest and requiring high precision location will be able to get installed on devices without a GPS. It means that cgeo will be installable on devices where only network-derived location is available. Do we want this, or do we want to restrict (as I believe it is right now) cgeo to platforms with a GPS to ensure a good user experience?

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Log some caches from different lists Delete some of them from all lists, let some remain on the different lists Open the history Select &quot;Refresh all&quot; Actual behavior after performing these steps: All refreshed caches are now stored on the default list (whereas caches still stored on a random list will additionally appear on the default list and no longer stored caches will also appear on the default list) Expected behavior after performing these steps: Refreshing the history should neither store no longer stored caches, nor add them to the default list Version of c:geo used: 2016.08.27 Is the problem reproducible for you?

		Just a cosmetical thing: According to the Crowdin project settings here we can use our own domain/subdomain to redirect/point to crowdin. So we could use e.g. translate.cgeo.org to refer users to our Crowdin page if I understand this correctly. Would IMHO be a nice shortcut which can easily be recognized as I always struggle to remember the correct URL refering to our Crowdin project. 👍 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open GC4C67W It has a final waypoint without valid coords (as the owner probably decided to make it visible but hide its coords) Store the cache Open the (live) map of that region Actual behavior after performing these steps: The cache is shown with the final marker on the map Expected behavior after performing these steps: The final marker should not be shown, as the final waypoint has no valid coords Version of c:geo used: 2016.08.27 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: Up to approx. March 2016 this was implemented as suggested but changed thereafter. Users are complaining as they are no longer able to differentiate between real modified mystery final coords and those &quot;dummy&quot; caches. I have in mind, that I already have seen such an issue but can't find it.

		I was just approached with the following request: In the logging activity menu the menu items for saving the log and for deleting the log are directly besides each other, therefore leading to frustrating when hitting the deletion menu item unintendedly. I'll add undo to the log deletion operation, to take the pressure out of this. I still suggest to actually remove the &quot;store log offline&quot; item, since we store the log anyway when exiting the activity. Thoughts on that?

		github has finally introduced a rebase strategy for pull requests. Last time when we discussed whether squasing would be an option, most developers voted for not destroying the history of the atomic commits. Rebasing would completely fit to that requirement and still give a more clear history view. Unfortunately there is no option to select a default, when enabling multiple strategies. I therefore suggest to disable all other merge strategies in the repository settings to basically enforce rebase on merge. For reference, this is how to the admin section looks like: Comments? 👍 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Log a cache find and attach picture with the log (GC.com) Send the log Actual behavior after performing these steps: An error message is shown, that sending seems failed and user shall check on website (retry/cancel/offline). Expected behavior after performing these steps: This occured to me on the last 14 days for each picture I attched, so something seems wrong while checking the result. In all cases log and picture had been uploaded correctly. Version of c:geo used: Master Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes (at least it seems like that to me...can't do extensive tests right now) Other comments and remarks: Feel free to test with my owned caches to check whether reproducible

		Heroku now lets us use a SSL certificate for our custom domain (status.cgeo.org). We got one from StartSSL and installed it for API calls. In order to be able to migrate away from Heroku to a hosted server, we now need to replace API calls from https://cgeo-status.herokuapp.com to https://status.cgeo.org. After this, we can freely move status.cgeo.org to another host. Note that older installations using the Heroku address will be able to be redirected using the Free plan since they will not use our custom domain when talking to Heroku.

		Feature request Hi guys, thanks for your great job! It is possible to display the background-image of a cache-listing in c:geo? If the picture is in the gallery than its shown in cgeo. But often the background is not in the gallery and in this case it will not be shown. I hope that will be possible. Thanks and best regards king-ton

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Some Cacheowners, especially in the US, are writing URLs in the hints of their listings. Here is an example: https://coord.info/GC4W4BP cgeo recocnise this links and shows a blue &quot;visit link&quot; instead. But its not clickable. if you click on the link the whole hint is only getting en/decrypted Actual behavior after performing these steps: &quot;visit link&quot; in hint not clickable Expected behavior after performing these steps: &quot;visit link&quot; should open the link, not en/decrypt it like normal hint-text alternativ: dont convert it to &quot;visit link&quot; so that it can be read or copied Version of c:geo used: 2016.10.13 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes

		FB reports tell, that people are located in Iran by default when GPS is not available. I can reproduce by switching off GPS and starting c:geo twice (because home coords are only used after second login AFAIR).

		Just as a reminder. From todays IRC discussion: [20:53] OneEyed: What do you think? Merge release to a new old-release and master to release now? This would enable us to publish a RC as beta version on Play. Background for me is still to enforce shorter release cycles. [20:59] Lineflyer: Sure [21:00] What about doing that tomorrow or the day after, once we ensure that this release is in ok shape? [21:19] And we might want to think about promoting Mapsforge beta to default [21:19] Did it get online tiles? [21:20] Not yet [21:20] I started to collect the necessary infos, but was not yet bale to implement it [21:20] mmh...that would be the requirement of course [21:21] Just think about if it would be doable or wait until next cycle

		I would love to have (on a per cache option) the Personal Note on a own tab (site?). Especially on long multicaches (example: GC1K0FM) it is unpractical to always scroll down to note the value of the next stage and go back and search for the description of the next stage. Great would be to just swipe left and right to switch between the two views like switching to the logs works. There could be a &quot;edit in separate tab&quot; button below the current edit button.

		New map active (mapsforge beta) Open live map Enable live Select a cache to show its popup Press the &quot;route button&quot; (circle with angled arrow) A direct line is shown from current position to cache. Top shows distance, I presume it is direct distance. No route seems to be calculated. BRouter is installed and configured for car-test and started in server mode. BRouter has appropriate data already downloaded. Tested and confirmed working using it within OSMAND. in c:geo there is no indication that BRouter is detected, or even if there is such depedency. User has no way of determining if c:geo and BRouter work together or not. Line visual theme (simple red with slight alpha) shown from position to cache (or presumably would be route) is visually not well represented. Assume it is shown as route properly, in sample screen, it would almost be indistinguishable over the red primary roads there. Could be related to #6017 Parts of this issue were conceptually defined here #6033 before being discovered.

		I observe that storing caches (actually, both SU and COM) takes really long time and also time prediction is horribly wrong - it says &quot;3 minutes left&quot; and downloads for 15 minutes actually. I suggest to take a look to optimization of the downloading. Maybe use multi-threading, maybe use bulk download API (if possible), or just check for bottlenecks Version of c:geo used: 2016.10.30-NB-057d341 Is the problem reproducible for you? Y

		FYI: A RC was generated (2016.11.01-RC1) and uploaded to beta channel after testing the date format fix (#6065) to get feedback. I will meanwhile continue to test the date format compatability in current nightlies (as the implementation is different) so that we can decide later if we want to go with another release from release branch or go as suggested in #6061. My opinion: Since we pubslihed the info about the workaround (via status.cgeo.org) support mail and social network are back to normal by now....so might be no urgent need for a fix. On one hand I would like to see the date issue completely fixed as soon as possible, but on the other hand I would like to avoid to short release cycles on Play (bugfix and feature release right afterwards). So undecided somehow... any other opinions?

		I suggest to remove the selectable live map strategy for the following reasons: Users I spoke with are not even aware of this option Users I spoke with always prefer to see the cache type and get most information out of the map Networks have become faster There are often users on support and in ratings claiming that they only see ?? caches as they accidentally selected &quot;Fastest&quot; thinking it would be the same but just faster Make things simpler, less options The speed dependent solution (Current default) should be the fixed strategy. 👍 3

		enter cache details Select Navigate - Save static maps Maps are loaded but display a yellow error marker and something seems incorrect (did not look in detail) According to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/error-messages#warnings this means an error in the request.

		Noticed in master. This should be modernized to use RxJava to benefit from fine scheduler control, parallelism, and ability to cancel requests properly, instead of using a thread. The StaticMapsProvider is already reactive. Also, some operations (such as the refresh operation from the menu) appear to block on the UI thread. This should be adressed as well. 11-11 22:16:29.489 E/cgeo    (29111): [Thread-2] StaticMapsActivity.LoadMapsThread.run

		Asked by a user on FB: Currently we have the nojit-version only for our nightlies. As the underlying bug is still not fixed on those devices (e.g. Lenovo) and if we want to offer a stable version also for users affected, it might be meaningful also to have a nojit version based on release (which each release cycle). If this is feasible by &quot;just&quot; creating a new CI job I would support this request. Note: FAQ needs to be adapted accordingly once it is available. If we would have a nojit-version based on release we could stop having it for the nightly instead

		Detailed steps causing the problem: cgeo shows an empty logbook, for example when opening GC6RDC2. The issue with empty logbooks seemed to be resolved, but now reappeared in nightly build 2016.11.16-NB-d2c2bc9 (or one day before). Actual behavior after performing these steps: No log entries are shown, even after refreshing the cache. Expected behavior after performing these steps: Log entries should be dislayed Version of c:geo used: 2016.11.16-NB-d2c2bc9 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Galaxy Note II, Galaxy Tab 10.1 214 Edition, Android 4.4.2 Other comments and remarks: none

		It would be nice when caching in remote areas where cell reception is on again off again, that when you hit upload on the personal note page, that it is queued up to send when you get back into cell reception. Currently, the only way to know if it was sent or not, is if GC.COM is missing a personal note.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: On my PC I added a bunch of caches to the &quot;send2cgeo&quot; import queue; On my Android 6 phone I tried to import them to a list; Actual behavior after performing these steps: It imported a lot of caches correctly, but is now stuck on cache GC11CPZ - maybe it's related to its name starting with a &quot;#&quot;? Expected behavior after performing these steps: Every cache should be properly imported. Version of c:geo used: 2016.11.05 Is the problem reproducible for you?

		A user contacted us on support with a question I cannot answer. He said, that a GPX file with version 1.1 would not import into c:geo (I confirmed that). Here is an example file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/26ute3tb35brb9p/gpx_test.gpx?dl=0 Only after converting it to version 1.0 it can be imported into c:geo. The conversion was done with RouteConverterWindows. Here is the resulting file which imports fine in c:geo: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8lu084smmnz6yiw/gpx_test_10.gpx?dl=0 Can someone explain to me the difference and why we cannot import the first file?

		Status: We have a beta version 2016.11.21-RC (20161120) out and currently it seems to run rather stable (user base is approx. 50-200 consecutive users according to status.cgeo.org). Will try to gather the identified ToDos next days (all we/I know are listed as issues already). Some are already fixed so I will check to issue another RC/beta asap.

		This is more or less a reminder to myself (and others who would like to test): Some user reports for the current RC version (2016.11.28-RC) tell, that there are problems in the history: Offline logged caches not visible History cannot be emptied History is emptied but cache count in title bar still shows x caches on list I cannot reproduce any of them right now, but as we had a change in this area I think there might be some leftover bug under special conditions. I will try to gather more information from users and try to test some things myself. 👍 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Remember the amount of saved caches on your lists as shown on the mainscreen as X Open live map Click on a non-detailed cache (with orange circle) From the popup select Log Visist Enter log text and press back to save the log Actual behavior after performing these steps: Cache icon has now markers for offline logged and saved(?) Saved caches amount on main screen is now x+1 Cache is not visible in lists Cache is visible in history Opening this cache in history will show the non-detailed status: Empty description, Empty logbook Cache details screen shows &quot;Saved on device 11746 days ago&quot; Expected behavior after performing these steps: I don't know enough about the DB structure to judge the best way of fixing this. However from a user perspective: It should show up in the history (as it does) It should not count to the amount of total caches stored in lists as it is not part of any list contained there It should not show up with saved icon on map Version of c:geo used: 2016.12.10-NB Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: This seems to be not caused by the change of @pstorch (ded3fb7) as the behaviour is the same with this fix (fresh RC) and without this fix (current nightly).

			<description>
		I frequently want to store all the caches in an area but also check them all to see which caches are particularly interesting. Caches can be particularly interesting for various reasons such as helping to satisfy a challenge cache, filling in holes in the Jasmer grid or the DT grid, or just being at a location that would interest me. So I add the caches that are particularly interesting to one of various lists. However when I look at the map or the list of stored caches for the area there's no indication of what other lists the cache is on. And if I look just at the list of &quot;interesting&quot; caches I'm likely to miss other caches that are nearby. What I propose to solve it is when displaying a list of caches to display small icons after the &quot;Small Offline&quot; for each list the cache is on. That way I can see the list of &quot;Nearby&quot; caches or I can look at a stored list for the area and quickly notice if I'm near a cache that I don't want to miss. This would be similar to the way mail user agents universally have a feature allowing you to &quot;star&quot; important emails. I have a few ideas of how to indicate what icon to use. One option is to provide a dropdown in the &quot;Rename List&quot; dialog which allows you to set an icon. This has the advantage that users would see the option when creating the list and also that not every list would have to have an icon so users could choose which lists were actually important. Another would be to simply use the first character of the list name. So caches would have a series of letters next to them. Users who want icons can put unicode emoji signs as the first character of the list name. This has the advantage that users would get the benefit even if they aren't aware of the feature and they don't have to take any explicit action to enable it. Incidentally, I think when displaying a specific stored list it should exclude that list's icon from the listing. I am a developer but have never poked at any Android app development so I may be able to do this and submit a pull request but may need some guidance, especially on Android environment quirks.

		The various challenges people set themselves or take up from challenge caches often drive people to seek out caches that would help satisfy the challenge If you look on project-gc.com you can see various grids and cache attributes and it's quite common for particularly nerdy cachers to want to collect all the boxes of those grids. Two of the most common are a) Filling all of the DT grid -- i.e. all 81 combinations of difficulty and terrain. Oncepl filled people look to repeat the cycle, i.e. fill it with numbers &gt;= 2 and so on. b) filling the &quot;Caches by hidden month&quot; grid. The challenge caches for this are named after the person who first invented them &quot;Jasmer&quot;. So you frequently see people talking about finding &quot;Jasmers&quot;. I maintain a list called &quot;Jasmer&quot; which has any caches in areas I'm interested in that were hidden in a month that I'm currently missing on my Jasmer grid. However this has several problems. a) I can't store all the caches around the world this way so when I go to a new area I need to add more even if I'm not planning to do much caching and expecting to have data b) it's really hard to remove caches when I fill a spot. Removing dozens of caches from a lit based on an attribute that doesn't show in the listing is laborious and error prone and some of them may still be worth storing for other reasons but some may have had no other reason to be on the phone. What I would suggest instead is to keep an internal representation of the Jasmer grid and DT grid -- they're very small and easy to fetch from geocaching.com and/or project-gc but also fairly easy to just construct and update from stored information too. Then display an icon or word on the listing and on the cache detail page if the cache fits the property. It would be neat to provide a virtual list for these properties too which would display all stored caches that have the property. Then my workflow for most areas would be &quot;store all caches in the area&quot; then &quot;display virtual list jasmer&quot; choose my destinations based on that and then look at all stored caches in those areas.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: save a cache to a list try to save another cache Actual behavior after performing these steps: the checkbox in which the previously saved cache was stored is ticked Expected behavior after performing these steps: in the dialogue, none of the checkboxen is ticked (unless the cache was already in any lists, in which case those should be ticked) Version of c:geo used: nightly build 2016-12-12 note it didn't occur in some previous (november?) nightly build Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Android 4.4 Liquidsmooth; I could give the full info if necessary, but this is a UI issue, and therefore unlikely to be needed. Other comments and remarks:

		Currently the new icon decoder (#6201) decodes virtual and webcam caches (same color) as webcam caches on the map. I suggest to change this to decode both as virtual. Reason: From my experience in US and remote locations all over the world Virtuals are more often than Webcams From my experience in Europe both types are same rare Logical: All webcams can be considered as virtual, but not all virtuals are webcams. So showing Virtuals is less wrong. @mucek4 wants to take a look on this tomorrow, so I assign him.

		Use Case: Base Members cannot add PMO caches to lists. On the other hand, BMs are allowed to log and sometimes have access to PMO listings, e.g. through a Premium Member colleague. Phase 1 could be to create a cache entry by entering GCCode, Name and Coords manually. Later some details could be retrieved automatically, e.g. owner, D/T rating. One way to get this information is nearby search. Currently the only way to enter PMO coordinates is to add a reference point to an already existing different cache.

		Sorry in advance if duplicate. Is it possible to add possibility for creating new caches? For example, now when I want to create a cache, I record all points with coordinates as a waypoints of some other cache and use them for creating new cache at home. I think it may be convenient to have ability to create a cache just from c:geo (with possible following posting to the Geocaching website(s)). What do you think?

		Follow up from #6186 (comment). It turned out that due to the lack of foreign keys in the DB it happens that geocaches got deleted from cg_caches without their related records in dependent tables like cg_logs, cg_waypoints, ... The DataStore.cleanIfNeeded() is the housekeeping method which regulary (on startup) cleans up the database. This should be extended to also clean up these orphaned records as well.

		Not sure if this might be a duplicate...wan't there an issue about saving a non-detailed cache Detailed steps causing the problem: Open live map, set strategy to &quot;Fast&quot; Select an orange circled (= non-detailed) cache From the popup select &quot;Log Visit&quot; and store the log offline Actual behavior after performing these steps: In the popup you can now read &quot;Saved on the device 17174 days ago&quot; Expected behavior after performing these steps: The correct saving date should be used Version of c:geo used: 2016.12.28 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes

		I found a difference depending of whether or not &quot;One-click offline log&quot; is active. Can someone explain: Detailed steps causing the problem: Enable &quot;One-click offline log&quot; in Menu - Settings - Logging Open live map, set strategy to &quot;Fast&quot; Select an orange circled (= non-detailed) cache From the popup select &quot;One-click offline log&quot; and select found Actual behavior after performing these steps: Cache does not get stored Expected behavior after performing these steps: Should be treated in the same way as when using the online log function (see #6231)

		[22:03] IMHO we should ask the user or directly download the details if he opens a nondetailed cache This is possible from live map popup of a previously offline logged cache or from history of an offline logged caches. Reference to #6231

		This isn't really a cgeo issue, but I've noticed that many of the maps I download for cgeo [ from http://download.mapsforge.org/maps/europe/ ] haven't had an update since Apr 2016 or even older. Any idea what to do or where to raise the issue?

		Right now there is automatic coordinates in personal notes parsing and creating waypoints from them. Could you please also add the same for main cache description? Reason - if service doesn't have waypoints functionality (like SU) then all steps for multi cache are just in the description. So I have to copy-paste description to personal notes to get waypoints P.S. Is there possibility to assign waypoint name thru parsing? Once I found out that if I write like &quot;final - &quot; than type of WP will be &quot;final destination&quot;. Is it documented somehow?

		Problem: The Log Date Format actually displays the current date formatted with the date format in use. On some dates, it will not be possible to infer the date format in use. On, say, February 2, the Log Date Format could be displayed as 02/02/2017, but it is not possible to infer which of the formats DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY was actually used. This feature was implemented in commit 8ad942f Solution: Display the actual format string, like DD/MM/YYYY, or, if that is not feasible, use a fixed example date which makes it possible to infer the date format, like December 14 2013.

		Maybe no bug, just a question: Do we get (or assume) any time zone information when parsing an event cache? I am asking because I had some scenario like this: Have phone set to GMT+1 Save an event cache Event cache date is the correct date as shown on website Set phone to GMT-6 The saved events date is now one day earlier Greetings from Panama (what explains why I just discovered the problem).

			<description>
		Feature request: Allow c:geo to install on devices which can not install c:geo now (probably because the lack of gps) using the play store, so it can be used to plan trips or post logs with minimal data usage. Use case: When traveling I try to import caches at home using a PQ or create a small PQ where we are, so I have all interesting caches imported in c:geo. Using the map feature I can easily plan a (hiking/bike) trip or select a cache to log (with live off). When logging I do not need data usage anymore to select the cache I want to log, only for the logging itself within the app I use data. For searching I even don't need extra data usage. I could do just that with our old tablet (transformer tf101), but after replacing it with a chromebook with play store I can not install c:geo. (Pocket Query Creator can be installed and works as expected using google location services). Since the tf101 never managed to get a gps position there shouldn't be a problem using c:geo on the chromebook, unless I'm not allowed to install in via the play store for another reason.

Yes Other comments and remarks: According to several sources (e. g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod) the development of Cyanogenmod is carried on under the new project name LineageOs (http://lineageos.org). The old websites are not reachable any more and no download can be performed. Therefore a new source for customROMs should be linked. I would suggest to link to LineageOs as it's the same project under a new name. Greetings. Nmxcgeo SORRY, I JUST SAW, THAT I'M IN THE WRONG REPOSITORY FOR THIS ISSUE

		After executing the function &quot;Extract waypoints&quot; it might or might not be succesful in extracting waypoints. It also happend to me, that it took some time until the extracted waypoints finally showed up in the waypoint tab (I suspect the process was still running while swiping to the waypoint tab). We should provide a feedback to the user about the result of the extraction. This could be done with a small toast like &quot;Extracted x waypoints from cache description&quot; / &quot;No wapoints found in cache description&quot;

		If you are adding a lot of waypoints for a (multi)cache newly created waypoints are at the bottom of the list with the add button below the list. To add a new waypoint you always have to scroll down (swipe up) first to access the &quot;Add waypoinr&quot;-button. Same goes to access (or use) a newly created waypoint. Suggestion is to create a setting to show waypoints in reverse chronological order (newest on top), with the &quot;Add waypoint&quot;-button right above the list, or not (as it currently is).

		It's more a topic to think about than an detailed feature request. Or maybe someone could give me a hint how to manage this situation. Case: I'm arriving to a new city (i.e. San Francisco) where there are dozens and dozens of existing caches. I have limited time and I don't want to visit crappy caches like &quot;It's my favorite garbage bin and I decided to create a cache here&quot;. When I open the map, I see hundreds of caches around, often more than one in each city block Problem statement: I want to visit as much as possible &quot;good&quot; caches in some district and as less as possible &quot;bad&quot; caches. Criteria for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; very depends on a lot of things (read as &quot;some personal filters&quot;) Right now I used following approach: scan caches manually and save offline log &quot;need maintenance&quot; for caches I wanna visit. So they became visible on the map and I can distinguish my selected caches from all caches in the area. Important notice: I still want to see all the caches in the area, because even if it's &quot;garbage bin cache&quot; but it's in 5-meters radius from my location, I will visit it. I just don't want to spend extra time, but if it's near - I'll grab it. One of possible solutions which could be enough for my purposes: Use filter &quot;More than N favorite points&quot; and highlight those caches While scanning caches around manually, have ability to &quot;highlight&quot; some caches manually. So there will be some list of &quot;highlighted&quot; caches. I would like to see them actually highlited on the map, i.e. having &quot;star&quot; symbol over the cache icon of something like this so I can easily see several caches I want to visit across all hundreds of existing caches. As usual, sorry if duplicate or if there is already working solution, but I didn't find it by my own.

		Problem statement: I'm a .SU and .COM geocaching player I prefer .SU caches everywhere, but in many countries there are a few .SU caches (which I definetely want to visit.) and thousands of COM caches (I will visit some of them). I want to have ability to see only SU caches on the map. Solution I'm using now: Go to Settings -&gt; Services and disable .COM, relaunch application, see\check\remember\save all SU caches, than enable .COM again and relaunch app. It works somehow, but pretty obvious that is't absolutely not convenient (plus, I had an issue with deleting all stored caches from service I disable, but it's another issue, so nevermind). Suggestion: Add option to select desired services to show just from the map activity. Something like selecting a list to store a cache - available services with checkboxes plus button &quot;show all&quot;.

		Received by a user: [...]would it be possible to list the trackable inventory by tracking code? Right now, it is listed in alphabetical order with the code below it. The only issue, especially when you move many trackables like myself, most of the time the user doesn't know the name of the trackable, only knows the code. So putting the codes alphabetically would be amazing and much faster. I never thought about that, but I fully agree. If I put trackables into the cache I always look for its tracking number and sorting by that would indeed make this more easy. Maybe we could also put it into the first row (bigger font) and the name into the second row (smaller font) or make both lines with same font size. ❤️ 1

		Hi, I am using Lint to check for warnings in cgeo and found some warnings that can cause problems: Multi-catch with these reflection exceptions requires API level 19 (current min is 14) because they get compiled to the common but new super type ReflectiveOperationException. As a workaround either create individual catch statements, or catch Exception I found warnings of this category on line 127 in FilterActivity.java line 31 in CustomProgressDiag.java and line 150 in SortActionProvider.java This warning may lead to crash as suggested in an issue report of Android (See comment 2) Format string auth_register is not a valid format string so it should not be passed to String.format This warning can be found in many places in the project like line 274 in TokenAuthorizationActivity.java. I have checked strings.xml. The string is really not a valid string format and the second parameter passed to the method would be ignored. This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur (anonymous cgeo.geocaching.utils.DisposableHandler) This is a possible memory leak issue found on line 399 in CacheListActivity.java and line 165 in GPXImporter I have found some related discussions from StackOverflow Hope this information can help. :)

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open the details of a server defined waypoint Click on the coordinates Select &quot;Duplicate waypoint&quot; Actual behavior after performing these steps: A toast is shown that the waypoint has been duplicated but the screen still shows the server waypoint While this is logical for itself, the user expectation might be different. Expected behavior after performing these steps: As the user clicked on the coords he most likely wants to enter new coords (we recently blocked this for server defined WPs for a good reason), so we should directly take him to the copied waypoint as he selected to duplicate it. Right now he has to leave the WP detail view, scroll and search for the duplicated WP, enter the WP details and then finally edit the coords.

		Due to #6326 we created a privacy policy for the contacts and calendar plugin. Note: It is required by Google currently only for the contacts plugin due to the permission android.permission.READ_CONTACTS. For the calendar plugin we do in fact only write to the calendar but also request android.permission.READ_CALENDAR. So we created a policy for the calendar plugin as well. Part of the Google requirement is also, to show/link the privacy policy from within the app: Action required: Include a link to a valid privacy policy on your app's Store Listing page and within your app. You can find more information in our help center. As we do not have any UI for the plugins this is not so easy to solve. I made the following proposal in the original issue: I do only see the option to (if technically possible) trigger a popup on first usage linking to the privacy policy.

		I would like to have a second GC.com account in c:geo that is used for loading cache data. For example, I have both a separate account and a team account with my father, with the latter having premium features for us both. I would like to use one account only for loading cache listing (PMO caches) and the other for status, logging and everything else. GS once stated that they are ok with families sharing premium features, which is why they don't check access on the log page, for example.

		PMO caches can be logged even without being PM as the log page does not check access rights (intentionally, according to GS). However, with c:geo, there is no way to log a PMO cache that is not stored offline. Please add a button to the PMO toast to open the log window nonetheless.

Maybe this improves PR reviews a bit. Here is a live example from yesterday: #6372 This issue is mostly for collecting feedback. If you have any complaints, or feel this should be disabled again, please feel free to comment. Otherwise I will close the issue in some days.

		Are you aware that there seems to be a fairly major change to the 'Log geocache' page on the website on the way? Sometimes (not always) when I try to log a cache on the website, I get a blue bar at the top of the page asking me to try the 'new logging experience'. It looks very simplistic, I didn't actually get it to work. I'm afraid I can't get it to re-appear now to get a screen shot. Just thought you might like a heads-up.

		Is it possible to use parts of cgeo as an unofficial command line interface/api? I tried to search for relevant classes or functions but I couldn't find any. For searching, retrieving, filtering caches in a pc terminal instead of in an android app?

		I tried to build a release with CI using http://ci.cgeo.org/job/cgeo%20release/ . This is the ouput which looks fine: http://ci.cgeo.org/job/cgeo%20release/26/ Still the resulting APK cannot be used for upgrading from existing release 2017.02.07: 12:50:33.641 Warning PackageManager 895  Can't install update of cgeo.geocaching update version 0 is older than installed version 20170207
 Cleanly installing the APK I can see that no version code has been set: 13:08:28.805 Info cgeo 11694  [main] Starting cgeo.geocaching 0 a.k.a null
 Assigning @mucek4 and @kumy. Can one of you take a look at this?

		While investigatin #6413 we found that we use CloseQuietly() although it is only supported starting with API level 16 (our minsdk is 14 now). There are only rare crash reports on Google Play however we have like 30 occurences in the code. So either we remove it or raise minsdk again to 16 which would close out all Android versions below 4.1.

		The setting section in Settings - System for &quot;GeocacheData&quot; is not likely to be identified as &quot;clickable&quot;. I suggest to add a field below the description text showing the currently used dir and clicking on that offers the dir selection dialog.

		As the operation of moving GeocacheData from internal to external might take long, we should show a clear progress. Test still outstanding how long it actually take with 1k or 5k cache dirs.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Have GeocacheData moved to external SD card Close and kill c:geo Remove SD card from device Start c:geo Log shows Warning (see first sdb log attached) Try to enter Menu -&gt; Settings (e.g. if you plan to set the storage to internal again) Actual behavior after performing these steps: Crash Expected behavior after performing these steps: Detect absence of GeocacheData dir and e.g. fallback (to be discussed) to internal dir in that case. Also without a fallback c:geo should not crash when entering settings menu allowing the user to manually adjust the dir setting.

		Follow up from #6426 #6426 (comment): Handling of SD-card full while moving needs either to be properly reported back to the user or we should check source size and target capacity before moving. Maybe an additional warning before the process would be good: &quot;This process can take a long time, do you want to continue&quot;. #6426 (comment) I'm thinking of calculating the used space in the GeocacheData directory and also showing the available free disk space in the selection dialog (per mount point). Then we could prevent choosing a directory, if there is not enough space.

		Wäre es möglich einzublenden, in welchem Landkreis (in der Schweiz = Gemeinde) ein Cache gelistet ist? Mir wäre das sehr dienlich. So wie beispielsweise in project-gc.com ... Jeder Cache ist in einer Region (wird bereits angezeigt), einem Bundesland (je nach Land = Provinz oder Kanton...) und einem Landkreis (in der Schweiz = Gemeinde) zugeordnet. Es geht darum diese niederere Ordnung zu erfassen und einzublenden. Lg Phil (QQI)

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Move geocache data from external to internal In the dialog before moving it shows &quot;xMB used&quot; (x=282,2 in my case) Move geocache data again from internal to external In the dialog before moving it shows &quot;yMB used&quot; (y=192,4 in my case) Move geocache date again from external to internal Actual behavior after performing these steps: In the dialog before moving it now shows &quot;0B used&quot; Actually also the progress is getting much faster now (almost instantly). Expected behavior after performing these steps: First we need to find out what actually happens here. Is the data still moved or do we count less data and also move less data?

		According to http://gsak.net/board/index.php?showtopic=32259 there will be two changes to the available log types for the API as well as the website: A user can log a cache only once as found. c:geo should handle this in two ways: Handle the message returned by the website in case of an error; show a warning and disallow another found log if the cache is known as already found. The owner of a cache cannot log found and maintenance logs. This should be reflected in the available log types in c:geo.

		Recently there were some new strings to be translated. One example is init_dbonsdcard with english string : &quot;On public file system&quot; IMO the use of the word &quot;public&quot; is not the best choice here. While from the developer perspective, the private internal storage space available for apps is one thing, and the user visible filesystems, be it internal emulated, internal partitioned, external as in SD card or external as in USB OTG mount, the latter might be considered &quot;public&quot; as opposed to private, no user access, from user point of view the semantics of the word &quot;public&quot; is different. user knows less about internal storage and more about what he/she sees via file manager, meaning internal emulated / partitioned and SD card (where available), as filesystems in the same sense as on a desktop computer. user might understand by &quot;public&quot; something like publicly available - that is available to anyone (not restricted to his device), including cloud like storage. Also this may raise undesirable flags in the user's mind. user knows about internal storage = internal emulated/partitioned storage as seen by file manager user knows about external storage aka SD card where available (device has slot and slot contains sdcard) IMO what c:geo should make clear is the following: c:geo storing it's database internally (same as app data and app cache; not available to user) c:geo storing it's database on internal/emulated storage (but user available) c:geo storing it's database on external/sdcard storage (user available) P.S. Don't forget about newer Android versions that drastically restrict access to sdcard directories (unless rooted)

		Hi, Cgeo remove the first log created by GSAK when user refresh caches. This first log contains personnal notes, it is alway the first log of the cache in the GSP created by GSAK. The user is always GSAK. Would it be possible to keep this log even after a refresh ? Detailed steps causing the problem: GSAK : Create some caches with personnal notes GSAK : Export GPX with options - include user notes in export - Extra informations to show in first log = %UserNote CGEO : Import the GPX (i put a gpx as attachement) CGEO : You can see the notes in first log of caches CGEO : Refresh all caches CGEO : The log created by GSAK as been removed Gpx.zip Many thanks for your software Best regards Pierre

		I would like to suggest a small improvement. It would be great to tag the waypoint as &quot;visited&quot; directly from the waypoint screen either by tapping on the icon here or via context menu braugt up by long pressing in here. It would save time a lot, cause now people have to edit and save the waypoint.

		Just found in another project a .editorconfig file. http://editorconfig.org/ EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems. Some editors are able read it without plugin, like Idea, some need a plugin, like eclipse. What about adding such support for our project? 👍 1

		Currently, the CI doesn't run the unit tests. Hence, it doesn't find errors that are covered by the unit tests or that are in the unit tests itself (see 919c415#commitcomment-21778589). Thus, we should also run the unit tests during CI. 👍 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Created backup using 2017-03-29 developer version. Uninstalled the app. Installed developer version of today. Actual behavior after performing these steps: Backup not found. File /.cgeo/cgeo.sqlite exists. Expected behavior after performing these steps: Backups from both old and new locations should be found, since this is a rather normal migration use case.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Have additional geocache data stored on internal storage (15 MB used) Fill up external SD with dummy data until less than 15MB are available (in my case 6MB available) Select Menu - Settings - System and open storage selection Actual behavior after performing these steps: Both dir options are shown (internal and external) Free space and used space is shown correctly Dialog looks normal but I cannot select the external SD (6 MB free) Expected behavior after performing these steps: I guess this is intentional as the free space on SD (6MB) is not sufficient (15MB used). This however is not intuitive in this dialog. The target which has not sufficient space should be e.g. &quot;greyed out&quot; Version of c:geo used: 2017.04.23-RC Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Samsung Galaxy S4

		Right now you have the option to save caches shown on the live map to a list and have them available offline. That feature is good, but like a second step / option is missing imho. If you have the live map open and you have caches in the area already saved but maybe a longer time ago you want to update just these caches you see. Right now this means go into every cache and update it as the whole list they are stored on is maybe too much. Wouldn't it be possible to have an menu option to update the caches seen in the live map like you are able to save them? Like offline update or so.

			<description>
		When c:geo is freshly installed on a device and first run, it presents several suggestions about it's functions. One such suggestion is suggesting by default to configure your geocaching.com account. And here comes the marketing and and P.R. problem. Assume one tries to introduce a new user to c:geo as an app for an opencaching service. Instead of having to enter (for the first time) the settings -&gt; services menu and choosing the appropriate service, c:geo by default pushes the geocaching.com service in front. Now I have a BIG marketing and P.R. setback because I have to give additional explanations (some confuse the new user) about other services. I don't mean to exclude or prevent the user from ever accessing other services, but still. Just try to imagine: you are tasked with marketing Pepsi to others. When you talk to them, you pull a can out of your bag. And it's a Coca Cola. Ok... they are both &quot;cola&quot; soft drinks. But you have made a fool of yourself and in the best case have a lot of explaining to do to catch up. Well, yes, most of c:geo users indeed are geocaching.com users. Still, for an open-source app, that has no affiliation and obligations (does it?) toward Groundpspeak, that offers geocaching features from many different services, doesn't seem fair, nor independent. 👍 1 ❤️ 1

		Detailed description of the problem: Adding new functions to the cache list causes a growing of the menu. Issue #6528 asks for a new functionality which adds an additional menu item. In that issue I suggested a restructuring of the main cache list menu. Actual behaviour: A lot of menu items... Suggestion: Restructuring of the menu like this: Show on map Filter Sort Switch select mode Invert select mode Manage cashes ** Refresh all / selected ** Move all / selected ** Copy all / selected ** Remove all / selected ** Delete offline-logs ** Delete past events Manage lists ** Create new list ** Remove current list ** Rename current list ** Make list unique Import ** Import GPX ** Import from send2cgeo ** Import from Android Export ** Export GPX ** Field notes ** Personal notes Remove from history

			<description>
		c:geo only uses GPS while running in foreground and with screen on. c:geo's purpose, by nature, is to provide location (GPS) based functionalities. For such a GPS focused application, to release the GPS in several, requiring restarting the GPS (even if it is a hot restart) and waiting for a fix, is not the best way towards users. Also as I have pointed out in other issues I have reported, please do not design c:geo in ways like expecting/requiring users to have the latest, most expensive, top of the line devices. Such behaviour is detrimental to c:geo and geocaching penetration to potential users in (at least) some countries that are not among the most highly developed (economically). And this means more then a few with low end devices. Now to the technical points. I strongly disagree with the strategy described here: http://www.cgeo.org/faq.html#gps-powersafe or the resolution here #4879 . Let me explain: requiring users to manage an external app to keep the GPS module on is by far not the best attitude to adopt towards users, for an app whose core functionality is based on GPS. It also adds complications and frustration to new or less IT experienced users. many apps adopt a UI switch to turn on/off the GPS while using that app. Just look at apps like Locus, OruxMaps, Androzic, Pathaway, etc. Keep GPS on until explicitely turned off by user, or application explicitely exited (see below). IMO c:geo should really consider this concept. time, position change and signal level since last turned on DO affect the hot start of any GPS. Time to fix may be significantly longer due to poor signal conditions (eg tall buildings, forest cover, valleys), as compared to maintaning an existing fix while signal level is decreasing. don't assume user has very high performance device, even if most of the developer have. In fact I would suggest to the developers to routinely test both on high performance and mid-range (lower mid-range) devices to gauge the performance of c:geo in a more realistic way. IMO, as a GPS oriented app, I would expect c:geo to perform at least the following way: c:geo is open, has focus. GPS on. c:geo is open, has focus, screen is off. GPS on. (by turning off the screen either manually or by timeout is by no means equal to the intention of turning off the GPS) c:geo running in background in the following scenarios: c:geo has focus and the user changes app that has focus (window manager) c:geo has focus and user goes to home screen These may be considered GPS on optional, or based on setting. But still, GPS on if GPS turn on button in c:geo was used c:geo is closed by explicit user action: c:geo has focus, from main screen, user presses &quot;BACK&quot;. Exit the app. Optionally display exit confirmation. c:geo has focus. User chooses &quot;Exit&quot; menu option (to be implemented). See many other dedicated GPS apps. Note: turning off GPS on some screens in the app is nonsense. I seriously doubt going through the settings menus for half a minute incurs such a significant energy saving. And going through the settings menu is by design a seldom used feature to begin with. And me leaving c:geo open in the settings menu draining battery because GPS is on, now that is my fault and my responsability. Even as an experienced IT person, I still find it frustrating and hassling to having to rely on an external app and the associated management, just to maintain GPS fix while I go geocaching with c:geo. 👍 1

		We still have some occurence of crashes reported on Google Play, which canbe tracked back to the fact that users have debug logging activated (in which case we might explicitly abort the app in some failure cases). After thinking a bit about it (and also discussion in some issues here) I came to the conclusion, that the end user experience is the important point here. We can not blame users for accidentally activating the setting, but should take measures to avoid them running into this problem. So mainly two ways I can imagine: Make the setting somehow transient It is not wise to disable debug logging on each start, because the startup and login process itself is likely to need debug logging during testing. But might be it is technically possible, to disable it after 24 hours?! Hide the setting from normal settings menu and move it to somewhere else. For example clicking x times on a certain icon to activate it.

		I just swithed from WM10 where I was using maaloo geocaching. While I'm really impressed with all the features has, there is one I'm already missing very much. Like stated in the subiect, it woild be great to be able to create a waypoint by just taping and holding on the map. Use case: I view the cache I want to drive to and it doesn't have a parking waypoint. In the map view I can see an OSM marked parking near by (or any other object that could serve as a parking spot). I tap and hold on that spot and a &quot;pin&quot; or createn wew WPT menu appears From that menu I can either save it or select &quot;Navigate&quot; option (which I can use to pass the location e.g. to Google maps. I consider this feature useful because sometimes suitable parking places aren't always on the road closest to the target (therefore the navigation might not lead you to them if you navigate to the cache coordinates). Also, in an unfamiliar country it is best to be navigated straight to the parking as different signs and markings already add to the confusion. Regards WW

		There are some users on social media and support mail asking us, why suddenly they do see a large amount of geocaching related pictures in their gallery apps. It seems, that some gallery apps also scan below /Android/data for media files and thus show them in the overview. I am not sure, if there is any standard or guideline if these folders should be scanned for media (e.g. on my S7 the default gallery app is not showing them). We could think about placing a .nomedia file into the base dir of GeocacheData. What do you think?

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Go to cache details Select &quot;Open in browser&quot; in menu Actual behavior after performing these steps: Only two options are available: c:geo internal browser c:geo Expected behavior after performing these steps: First of all, why is option 2 even an option? Seems pretty pointless, IMHO. I miss the following option 3. External browser, that opens the cache in the web browser of your choice. I know that this option was available in the past, but I do not know when or why it was removed. Version of c:geo used: 2017.05.13-NB-58da415 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes

		As we have some changes on release we could go for another bugfix release. Is any fix still in the pipe which we should wait for? e.g. there are some issues I created from crashes on Google Play: https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Google+Play+related%22 (the recent ones). Anyway we could release a beta version now. I will prepare this. @rsudev or others Can you upload strings to Crowdin to get translations. We have new strings (also on release).

		Follow up of #6546: @SammysHP wrote: With a shorter menu we could also think about disabling menu items instead of hiding them. It's easier to use a GUI if elements are always at the same place. What do you think about that? @Lineflyer @FUSSEL4 @pstorch I think we have +3 so far for this proposal looking at the replies in #6546 and reactions on the posting. 👍 2

		Probably I should have asked somewhere in IRC, but it's more convenient from smartphone here and also it will be documented. The question is stupid simple - how do you select which features to implement next (except bugfixing and some maintenance stuff)? Just decide witchin the evening chat in IRC? Or do you have some kinda voting for new features? Except implementing it by my own, is there some possibility to increase chance of being implemented for features I'm (and other users) interested in? Maybe it would be useful to have issues list with &quot;votes&quot; so you could see what users would like to see (&quot;users&quot; in this context == &quot;github users&quot;)

		Detailed steps causing the problem: -Download or write a personal Note ( with morge the 500x charactars edit it, make it longer, what do you want. reupload it too the server Actual behavior after performing these steps: When the note is longer then 500x characters c:geo open a popup window and tell you that the personal note will cut off by the geocaching.com server after 500x characters . Expected behavior after performing these steps: the popup window should only open when he note is longer then 2500x characters and then to tell you that the note will be cut off by the geocaching.com server after 2500x characters. Version of c:geo used: 2017.04.27-RC and 2017.05.22 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: Groundspeak has made an update to the personal note system and raised the max charakters from 500x to 2500x charakter. Is it possible to show the counted charaters of the personalnote field in the top of the edit field ( beside the close/save icon) like (1478 / 2500) ? greetings from germany Marco / Wulfman_Do

		While we currently have no changes on release since last release but some on master I guess we can do a quick new feature release (without many features actually) to catch up with master on market. First step would be merge of master to release and publish of a beta version. This would also allow to get some feedback on the new cache list menu structure. Please kindly give your &quot;Thumbs up/down&quot; and someone to merge once we have positive feedback.

While this commit solves a specific problem, it is not the solution for a correct rating.

		As owner I need to be able to add a &quot;Needs Maintenance&quot; (NM) log to my own Geocaches. This is necessary because some Geocachers report that something is wrong with a cache without adding a NM log. This helps to keep track of all my own caches which need some care. It seems, that NM was removed from the log menu. Please restore it to the state as it was before. Thank you! Christian

		As I just learned it is not possible anymore for a owner to log &quot;Needs Maintenance&quot; (NM) for his own geocaches. Therefore I registered a second account on geocaching.com which I want to use only to log NM. Also, my girlfriend has her own account, and sometimes, when she forgot to take her mobile phone with her, she wants to use my phone to log a geocache. But of course she doesn't remember her password. Would it be possible to add a multi user feature and make it possible to switch users fast and simple by selecting a user from a list of saved users within cgeo? Thanks, Christian 👎 2

		Detailed steps causing the problem: I upgraded Firefox last week to 52.2.1 version. After this I cannot see &quot;send to c:geo&quot; button/link on any geocaching page (ie, listing w/o button, detail on map w/o link, etc). Open, eg: https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC77V28_princezna-v-kocare Actual behavior after performing these steps: no button Send to c:geo next to &quot;Send to My GPS&quot; Expected behavior after performing these steps: button Send to c:geo next to &quot;Send to My GPS&quot; Version of c:geo used: Send to c:geo FF plugin version 0.38 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Windows 7 SP1, Firefox 52.2.1 (32-bit) Other comments and remarks: On Toolbar, on www.geocaching page, there is &quot;monkey button&quot;. After clicking arrow next to it, I can see &quot;Sent to cgeo&quot; and &quot;Geocaching map enhancement&quot; both marked as active. But, as I said, no button.

		I received the following announcement from crowdin: Hello, This is Andriy from Crowdin team, hope you are fine! Our developers have notified me that according to our database records, some API calls sent for the project(s) listed below lead to http://api.crowdin.net endpoint instead of https://api.crowdin.com : c:geo In a week, we're planning to perform a redirect to https://api.crowdin.com when the request is sent to http://api.crowdin.net or https://api.crowdin.net . It should not cause any issues with API communication, but still that would be great if you could verify your current configuration On July 25th, http://api.crowdin.net and https://api.crowdin.net are planned to be competely disabled and thus it's strongly recommended to switch to https://api.crowdin.com beforehand to prevent any pauses with your Crowdin integration. Kindly check this inquiry with your development team Should you have any questions or need further assistance, you are welcome to reach me directly. Thanks! -- Sincerely, Andriy Poznakhovskyy, Head of Customer Success, Crowdin beacon

			<description>
		When starting c.geo when it has no location fix (yet), then the map is always centered on my home location as defined in my geocaching.com account (see http://www.cgeo.org/faq#default-location). However, it is far more likely that I am interested in the area around the last known or shown position than that I am interested in the area around my home location (if these are different). Please adjust c.geo so that if it has no location fix then it shows the map centered on the last known (GPS) or shown (map) position, or even on the location of the last reviewed geocache (in c.geo's History list). All three of these are more likely to be of interest to me than the area around my home location. Some scenarios in which this matters: I am on vacation in a far-away location where I have to limit roaming charges and conserve battery power. Every time I go outside to go geocaching, I turn on c.geo and GPS. While it has no location fix yet, c.geo shows the area around my home location, which is far from my current location. I have to wait until it acquires a location fix before I can easily start looking at nearby geocaches -- or I have to laboriously navigate on the map from my home location to my current location again. When I'm inside, I have location services turned off to conserve battery power. When I turn on c.geo to review recent caches or to plan caches for the remainder of the day, c.geo again shows the area around my home location instead. Navigating on the map all the way from my home location to my current location is tedious, because I need to zoom out a lot to be able to get to my current location quickly, but then the geography is obscured by all of the geocache icons covering the entire area, so it is hard to tell to where to zoom in again. And if I want to go via the most recent cache in the &quot;History&quot; folder of the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list as a shortcut, then I have to wait until the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list displays, which takes a long time if it has 10,000 caches in it, as it did during my last vacation. If the location fix is lost while c.geo is on, then c.geo seems to assume that it is still at its last known position -- at least, the map then doesn't suddenly jump to my home location. It would be good if c.geo acted the same way if it lost its location fix because c.geo was turned off temporarily. Version of c:geo used: 2017.05.22 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes, very much so. It isn't a recent problem, either. c.geo has acted like this for as long as I've used it. Regards, Louis Strous

		A friend just demonstrated on his phone that he can open a cache from a mail in k9 and then start cgeo normally, and afterwards there are 2 instances running (as you can verify by editing some data without storing to database in one instance). Can we prevent this by adding some flags to our activities?

			<description>
		Dear developers, We are applying our performance diagnosis tool PerfProbe to debug the response time for searching for nearby cache given a same address. Through repeated testing in an identical setup, we observe intermittent slowdown for the search result to be displayed (response time on average around 3.6 seconds and can increase to over 7 seconds). Through its system-wide profiling and tracing, PerfProbe discovers that the source of extra delay results from longer waiting time for server-side response. In particular, cgeo app is waiting for the response of two sequential HTTP GET request - one by GCLogin.getRequestLogged inside the method GCParser.searchByAny and another by GCVote.loadRatings inside the method SearchResult.filterSearchResults (with the detailed call chain CoordsGeocacheListLoader.apply -&gt; GCConnector.searchByCenter -&gt; GCParser.searchByCoords -&gt; GCParser.searchByAny -&gt; SearchResult.filterSearchResults). We hope the findings from our tool can be helpful for your debugging. We are also interested in helping improving the performance of this interaction. One suggestion to improve the latency that we can come up with is to batch the two HTTP requests in one network round trip - parallel HTTP request if they have no dependency or otherwise combine the response information of two requests together such that one new HTTP request is sufficient. Thank you very much for your attention and clarification! Detailed steps causing the problem: Step 1: click &quot;Search&quot; Step 2: enter address information under &quot;Address&quot; Step 3: click &quot;Search by address&quot; Actual behavior after performing these steps: Intermittently longer waiting time for the list of nearby geo caches to be loaded Expected behavior after performing these steps: A list of nearby geo caches are loaded Version of c:geo used: 2017.03.29 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Android version: Android 4.4.4 Device: Nexus 4

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Have an offline &quot;found&quot; log stored for a saved cache (maybe optional) Open the offline log and send it online While the log is being sent provoke an action to get the activity into background (e.g. change to another app, go to home screen, (maybe) rotate device) Actual behavior after performing these steps: A toast appears &quot;Logtype has been changed&quot; Looking into the caches logbook you will see your &quot;found&quot; log online and an additional &quot;did not find&quot; log stored offline Expected behavior after performing these steps: Online log is posted Offline log is removed from device Version of c:geo used: 2017.05.22 Is the problem reproducible for you?

		Submitting &quot;needs maintenance&quot; log for GC cache gets a warning about submitting an &quot;unusual&quot; log type. Wouldn't &quot;special&quot; be a more meaningful word? It may also help if the text clearly stated that such &quot;special&quot; log type incurrs additional actions on the cache (like setting a flag, notifying owner, etc) Thank you.

		Using c:geo I have encountered (for unknown reasons) errors while submitting logs (with all my trackables set to &quot;visited&quot;). The message was smth like &quot;error posting log, please try again&quot;. Today I looked into my GC account from a PC and found that for caches where I encountered such errors I discovered that I actually posted several logs to that cache, instead of just one. In fact, there was a log posted for each attempt I made. Clearly posting a cache log and then posting a log for each trackable is done in the same thread (as regard to error handling) and the error message I got was erroneous, by that I mean: actual cache log was successfully posted the error happened for one of the trackables log (&quot;visited&quot;) I was left in the situation to retry to post the cache log, even though it was successfully posted the first time. I worked around by not visiting my trackables. Also note that it happened for many caches, but never for &quot;found logs&quot;. I encountered the problem with DNF and Needs maintenance.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: send2cgeo only accepts single cache IDs. This leads to possibly a lot of browser windows/tabs remaining open after a list of caches has been sent (e.g. from the respective GSAK macro or similar). Closing these windows via JS on the client side seems not possible, because the time required until the request is handled is undefined and getting the result seems impossible due to CORS issues. Expected behavior after performing these steps: additional parameter for send2cgeo to handle a ; etc. delimited list of cache IDs

		Just built a new nightly to take a first look at the waypoint calculator. I had no time to test in details, so just a short try where I either found a bug or still have a misunderstanding of the working mode. Detailed steps causing the problem: Start with a new calculation Assign A to F to the last lat and lon digits Enter formulas for A to F where A=a , B=b, C=c-b Actual behavior after performing these steps: When entering B=b the variable input field for b is shown, when entering C=c-b a new variable field for c is shown but the field for b is gone Expected behavior after performing these steps: Variable input b should stay Version of c:geo used: 2017.07.29-NB1 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Android 7.0 Other comments and remarks: I added a new label &quot;WP Calc&quot; to get a better overview for issues regarding the new WP calculator.

		The coordinate calculator assumes that the result of every calculation is a single digit for a single place in the coordinates. In fact, today, when I first tried it in the field, I had only one calculation for the whole decimal part of the minutes, and it proved to be useless… I think the feature is great, but it needs to be more flexible to not cause agony.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Put an offline map on a &quot;real&quot; ext sd card Try to find it in c:geo or choose directory Actual behavior after performing these steps: Map not found Directory on ext sd card not choosable Expected behavior after performing these steps: Scan &quot;real&quot; ext sd card, too or let the user choose a directory manually on it Version of c:geo used: 2017.07.24 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Huawai P10 Plus with Android 7
 Other comments and remarks: Got this issue reported from a friend. After moving the map to the internal storage c:geo found it. In the last refactoring with the new storage concept we haven't touched the Maps directories. There is some special logic (device dependent?) to find the mounted devices. Maybe this needs some rework.

		c:geo 2017.07.24 / Samsung Galaxy S6 / Android 7 I've been to an even recently and marked all my finds with &quot;open click offline log&quot;. Now I am at home and reopening each cache with a smiley on the map. I go to logs page, I click on the saved offline log, the online log page loads. I write my log and post it. Note: I have around 30 trackables and 9 geokrety with auto-visit. Sometimes, I can't say why, I see my posted online log and the existing offline log, although most of the times the offline log is deleted automatically.

		Logging caches especially if one has many trackables (10+) in the inventory set to visit is a time consuming operation, even with excellent internet connection. During this time c:geo is not usable. I request a feature to submit all online logs into a sending queue to run in the background, similar to how email programs take your letter and send it to the mailserver in the background. There should also be a page (similar to outbox) where one can see and manage logs posted for submission but not yet sent due to internet availability or other types of errors. In the list I should be able to do the following: force trying to resend all in queue remove from queue re-edit log and submit online without queue (to see errors, change things if necessary) empty queue (all not sent logs should remain as offline logs in c:geo until they are sent successfully) c:geo should warn upon exit (back from main screen) about unsent logs. c:geo should attempt resending logs not sent due to internet connection problems. (timeouts and such)

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Add a new waypoint Use the new calculator and enter some formulas Use the checkmark to close the dialog See a message with &quot;...saved...&quot; Don't realize there is another message Close the waypoint edit dialog with back button Actual behavior after performing these steps: Waypoint is not saved, a toast tells me that the changes were discarded Expected behavior after performing these steps: A warning popping up which warns the user before discarding the changes Version of c:geo used: nightly Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: Yes, I know we warn the user with the second toast after closing the calculator. But two toasts in sequence can easily be overlooked. I think we should ask the user for confirmation before discarding any changes. It's frustrating if it is suddenly gone.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Add a waypoint with calculated coordinates Enter some formulas/values which result in errors The preview below the variables show, that there is something wrong, either with an '*' or with a negative value Save the current state and go back to the waypoint Actual behavior after performing these steps: Valid coordinates are shown (some digits are 0 but valid) There is no indication in the waypoint or in the waypoint list that there is something wrong with the coordinate Expected behavior after performing these steps: Flag the waypoint as errornous Version of c:geo used: nightly Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: Errors in the calculator can be missed easily. When changing a variable value the keyboard is overlayed and the coordinate result is not visible. If the user just clicks the checkmark to close the dialog without first closing the keyboard to check the result, an error is missed. It's not visible in the other dialogs, that this waypoint has a problem.

		Due to #6682 and #6702 which have been fixed by @kumy on release branch meanwhile, we should publish a new release. A RC-version 2018.08.22-RC has been published yesterday evening and seems to roll out normal (no support mails, positive beta user feedback, no critical errors on Play Console). Due to the non working logging we should release this version rather soon. I will start preparations for that. In case we should wait and/or include other fixes, please let me know here.

		Normally I do only have one (owned) Geokret in my inventory (for testing purposes). Whenever posting a geocache log I set the Geokret to &quot;visit&quot;. The progress bar while logging clearly shows, that posting the Geokrety log takes several seconds. I assumed, that the server is really slow (as also mentioned before by @kumy) This weekend I used to have 3 Geokrets in my inventory. I set all of them to &quot;visit&quot; and noticed that only the first Geokret log (Progress shows: Posting Geokrety 1/3 (or similar text)) takes several seconds whereas the other two logs follow within split of a second. Is that really a server issue or does c:geo have some problem here? Unfortunately I did not have the possibility to take a debug log and now I only have one Geokret left in my inventory.

		From #6704 Interesting. I thought temporarily about linking the 'Calculator notes' with the 'waypoint notes' (or 'user notes') but didn't end up giving it much thought and just implemented a 3rd 'notes' field exclusively for the calculator. Would you find it more useful to have these notes merged in some way? If so I'll look at it as another ticket. Yes, I see no benefit having two separate notes. I feel it as an disadvantage to not see the calculator notes in the waypoint overview. If the calculator is used this usually contains information (e.g. variables and formulas) which might be interesting for other waypoints, too.

		I've noticed a styling problem in the cache list. Caches that have a color marker on the left (found, etc) have the following differences from caches without this marker: cache icon is larger. (AFAIK cache icon is composed from multiple images, that of the cache type, that of the found, that of having waypoints) text is offset to right with the width of the border-left and a padding-left (without marker, there is no spacing for the marker width and padding-left=0) This creates a visually disturbing zig-zag effect. IMO cache type icons (with or without composition) should be the same size and the contents of the first column should be aligned at a constant position, leaving space for that marker where it is missing.

		Some weeks ago I stored GC15GV4 on my device using an older nightly of beginning of August. I noticed no problem reading the description. Meanwhile I use a newer nightly 2017.09.03 and noticed the still stored cache had now black text on black background. As the caches was not refresehed since original storing it, it might be the visualization might have a bug in newer version. I might be wrong though. Can someone check this cache with the current market release?

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Today I used the WP Calc to enter the formula given in GC2DMGW In this formula the variables are not appearing in alphabetical order I entered the formulas in the sequence as given in the cache description Actual behavior after performing these steps: The lower case variables are sorted in the order of appearance, which makes it more difficult to fill them with values later on. Expected behavior after performing these steps: The lower case variables should be sorted alpabetically. Version of c:geo used: 2017.09.04-NB Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: Screenshot:

		We use linking in the personal notes to detect hyperlinks that may be in there. However, given that personal notes often contain values for mystery caches, the phone number linking kicks in for every 2+ digit number in the personal notes as an unwanted side effect. It would be nice if we could still have hyperlinks detected, but suppress phone number detection at the same time.

But as discussed here: opencaching/okapi#395 and here opencaching/okapi#392 (comment) most OC sites require it. Currently c:geo doesn't require a caption. How should we handle it? Make it a mandatory inputfield per Connector or set a default value?

		Just making this ticket as a way to track the suggestion that @pstorch made in #6704 that: I'm thinking about if we should change the button modes. With a short press it toggles between variable and original value. Maybe it should also toggle through the &quot;space&quot; case. So that this feature is more accessible. If that comment doesn't quite make sense out of context what @pstorch is suggesting is: Perhaps rather than simply having the calculator buttons toggle between 'Input-value&quot; and &quot;Auto-char&quot; (with the blank option being available by entering SPACE through a long press) that the calculator buttons have three states, being &quot;Input-value&quot;, &quot;Auto-char&quot; and &quot;Blank&quot;. Note that the &quot;Custom-char&quot; functionality will still be available through a long press, it just won't be the way you &quot;blank-out&quot; buttons.

		This is just being created in order to track the discussion in #6773 about allowing non-standard letters to be used in equations. @rsudev commented: A-Z (if that really is the definition) is less ambiguous than LETTER (which in some places might end up being äöü or even åđžć ... and @UniQP said: I would prefer to allow all characters accepted by Character.isLetterOrDigit(...) and simply use letter and digit in the message. Is that feasible? And later on @pstorch commented: Regarding the letter and digit discussion: at the moment it is ambiguous. Just tried ö, which is a letter, and got the above error message. I personally think we should restrict the variable letters to A-Z. If we allow all unicode letters from all languages, then we might run into sorting issues again. So, to avoid that and make things simple, I would suggest A-Z letters only. What do you think?

			<description>
		This was probably introduced with #6759 and seems to be caused by a change to the 'Plain Format' text field. The change gets triggered sometime between when the 'textListener' is added in onCreateView(...) and when the calculator's state is loaded in onResume(). The actual crash is caused by accessing the currentFormat variable before it is initialised but I can't for the life of me workout what is causing the text to be changed prior to the onResume() call. In any event simply protecting the reference to currentFormat with &quot;if null&quot; checks alleviates the problem but I would have preferred to isolate the cause of the text changed event in the first place but can't seem to find it.

		#6715, #6816 and #6821 are all addressing the calculator notes issue and all were closed before I was able to be involved with the changes, so I thought it would be best to open an issue of my own to provide input. As it stands the 'calculator notes' have been removed from the 'calculators state' but seem to be tagged onto the state externally with an 'ImmutablePair' object. In my mind if the notes field is essentially intended to be independent of the calculator itself it would be better to simply access the Waypoint's note data directly than tag it onto the calculator's state and kind of 'carry' them around together. I have an implementation of this and are mainly creating this issue so as to have a branch in which to commit this implementation.

		Reported on support mail for current beta version (2017.11.01-RC2): On the map, with some caches visible, when opening the menu there's an option to save them for offline use. Before, that menu option appeared only if there were at least one cache not yet saved. Now it appears allways, even if all visible caches are already saved on c:geo lists. @Bananeweizen Could this be related to your change 7c79739 ?

		As mentioned in #6716 (Managing ambiguous results in WP Calc where trailing/leading zeros are involved) it can be necessary to insert additional zeros into the result of a formulation, and in some instances there is contention as to whether these should be 'leading-zeros' or 'trailing-zeros'. It has been suggested that a method of identifying how a result has been manipulated would be desirable and a suggestion made is to colour the 'manipulated' digits differently to provide this indication: Developer notes: Implementing this is not as trivial as one might at first think for a few reasons: The main concern is that the text to display for a valid location is actually obtained from the waypoint itself rather than from the input strings used to create it. This is done specifically so that users can be aware of exactly what the resulting waypoint will actually represent rather than their entered value (which may result in something they did not expect). Although we have access to both the input string and the resulting GeoPoint's string displaying a 'diff' of these two strings is not as trivial as you may think. However, once it is known what colours should be used for each letter actually displaying the desired results shouldn't be too hard given TextView's support the use of HTML strings. Further notes: Once implemented this &quot;Syntax Highlighting&quot; would be most useful in conveying information to users of what leads to &quot;Parsing Failures&quot; (as related to #6802: Coordinate Parser Needs Work).

			<description>
		While using the waypoint calculator I wondered how I can share the variables gathered from stage to stage among the waypoints for easy transfer in the calculator formulas. My idea was to create a virtual waypoint called &quot;Variables&quot; to collect all stage variables in its user notes. From there I wanted to copy them into the stages' user notes. The user notes are also visible in the calculator so they can be copied in the variable values of the waypoint calculator. In the following screenshot you can see virtual waypoint &quot;Variables&quot; from where the variables were copied into the waypoints &quot;Stage 2&quot; and &quot;Stage 4&quot;. Unfortunately there is no way to copy the user notes from a waypoint. 😮 I did a rough implementation that creates a new waypoint action &quot;Copy Notes&quot;. This action strips HTML from the waypoint note, merges with user note and copies both into clipboard. Before I continue on the code I just wanted to ask in advance if there is interest and a chance to get this feature included.

		This was already discussed at the end of #6697. There are various ways you can get unwanted coordinates in a waypoint: you just want to add a note there you prepare waypoint calculator formulas in advance In all these cases arbitrary coordinates (usually your current position) are stored into the waypoint and there is no way to get them removed again. This has different disadvantages: you cannot distinguish between a waypoint with correct or incorrect coordinates it pollutes the waypoint map with wrongly placed waypoints This is of course more problematic for caches with lots of stages: you get a wild mixture of valid and arbitrary coordinates. Therefore it would be nice to have an action to remove waypoint coordinates from a waypoint. The implementation for this is trivial. It acts in the same way as the &quot;Delete&quot; action in the waypoint context menu. This means, there is no confirm dialog and there is no different behavior for user created waypoints or listing waypoints. The latter can be restored by a cache refresh again. I will share my changes tonight. 👍 2

		@Matze2 (#6797 (comment)) and I experienced a sudden duplication of waypoints while using the calculator. No sure yet when it happens exactly.

		From support mail: It appears that Markdown numbered lists aren't supported. As an example, my log on https://coord.info/GC75BKC (I'm B2Pi, the log is https://coord.info/GLQYTWP1), the list shows as numbers online, but as bullet points within CGeo My comment: Although the logs are formatted in markdown by the users, we retrieve the converted HTML from the website (AFAIK). However in my browser the mentioned log shows up numbered, therefore I am wondering why it does not in c:geo.

		With this change #6866 GS presents the disabled and archived logs at the top of the geocache page. It's a very useful information for users to see right away what's wrong with the cache. Suggestion is that we also add this to the top of the geocache details activity. What do you think?

		Same as #5498 but for other actions like &quot;Caches around&quot;. This somehow slipped through because I thought that &quot;Nearby&quot; action is the same as &quot;Caches around&quot;. Only the way how the start coordinates are determined is different. But in fact, there are two different loader types: CacheListType.NEAREST (fixed in #5498) CacheListType.COORDINATE (still truncates list to 40) Fix should be trivial. I will handle it.

		For your attention: In the Geocaching Forum I found the release note regarding the latest site changes as of December, 6th 2017. It is mostly dealing with the cache edit page (which does not affect c:geo) but also contains a section about other updates, which I list below with my assumptions: Change In c:geo D1 is enforced for all Event Caches. Event Caches must have a 1-star difficulty rating because it is easy for geocachers to “find” events. Should not affect c:geo as they will be shown as D1 Event Caches no longer include a container size. This means probably, that the container information might be ommited on the website. We should check new events. [...] In addition, the links “Watch” and “Add to List” are available only after publication, because we found that they were not used by COs prior to publication. This is a rare case, but an owner of an unpublished cahe can load it in c:geo and possibly the watch option will be shown to him but not usable Previously, there were two text fields to describe your cache. During the Cache Submission Process, those were the cache summary and long description. On the Edit Cache Listing page, they were the short description and long description. Going forward, there’s just one field. However, the short description field still exists for any caches that currently have a short description. If a cache owner removes an existing short description from their cache, the field will disappear. We should doublecheck a new listing which only has one description field to check if there are problems The Related Web Page field now only exists on caches that currently use that field. If a cache owner removes an existing Related Web Page, then the field will disappear. I don't know how this was handled in the past. If a cache does not use the related web page, was this field ommited on the page in the past?

		Discussed on IRC yesterday: 23:03:06Lineflyer: Another topic: Shall we do a quick step? Right now master and release are close to each other but still some new things in master. How about merge to release and push another beta next week. You know...I prefer smaller release cycles
23:22:00pstorch: Good idea. Before we merge the big changes in master.


Any open PRs which should be merged before mergin to `release`?

		From support mail (translated by myself): Since this version (2016.12.06) I have the problem, that if I e.g. see 50 caches on the map and I select &quot;Save for Offline&quot; all 50 caches are saved but not only those currently not yet saved. This worked in previous versions.

		Parsing of the GC search result page doesn't work anymore. First thing I found is that the parsing of if (!row.contains(&quot;images/wpttypes&quot;)) { because it is mixed case now. Checking for if (!row.contains(&quot;images/WptTypes&quot;)) { gives a search result, but all cache types are wrong (unknown).

		See formuia in GC7ENZJ. North 48° ((B * D) +((D+E+A+B+C+F+G+H) * C)) *A East 011° (E+D) * A * B Result of both formulas is something like 23456. There is no possibility to &quot;float-divide&quot; by 1000 to get 23.456. The only way to achieve the desired result is to repeat both formulas once with &quot;/ 1000&quot; and once with &quot;% 1000&quot;, e.g. in plain mode: N 48° (((B*D) + ((D+E+A+B+C+F+G+H)*C)) * A / 1000).(((B*D) + ((D+E+A+B+C+F+G+H)*C)) * A % 1000) E 011° ((E+D) * A * B / 1000).((E+D) * A * B % 1000) Needless to say that this is cumbersome.
