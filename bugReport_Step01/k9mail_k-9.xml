		Right now we unconditionally set wasEncrypted to false in MessageCryptoHelper.handleCryptoOperationSuccess(). The information whether a message was encrypted or not needs to come from the crypto provider to account for &quot;null-encryption&quot; and other weirdness.

		I have 2 emails which both have an attachment called external_0.jpg. When viewing these messages, k9 usually shows the wrong image for at least one of them. I suspect that FileHelper.createUniqueFile is subject to a race condition when downloading messages and needs a mutex - I'm running on the quad-core Galaxy Note 2.

		When reading through messages in inbox via IMAP, I typically tap archive to move to next item. Frequently, K9 shows the next message nearly blank with only one line of text visible. Swiping up/down scrolls the message through this one line area. Tapping previous, then next causes the message to be displayed normally. Currently on Android 5.0.2 on Nexus 7 and K9 5.004. Please let me know what additional info would be helpful.

			<description>
		I'm a long time user of k-9... Never any problems on several phones through the years. My Samsung s3 was getting a bit slow earlier, (wasn't using k-9 by the way) so I rebooted. Very shortly I needed to reference an email from last week, so I went to k-9. The first thing I noticed was my icons on the screen (I have shortcuts to each account as I have multiples) were missing and just a white mail folder was in their place... Even the name is gone and replaced with &quot;k-9 mail&quot; I tapped on each one and everything is gone. My color theme, all my folders, emails, accounts, EVERYTHING!!! The only thing that shows up is a bar at the top that says &quot;show unread count for...&quot; And two selections, one says &quot;unified inbox&quot; and &quot;all messages&quot;. Clicking on either of these brings up a &quot;busy&quot; screen but nothing happens at all. If I click the back arrow at the top, it takes me to the welcome screen as if I've just installed k-9. Also back on the home screen, the text under the white Mail icon changes from &quot;k-9 mail&quot; to &quot;all messages&quot; I also opened up k-9 from the actual icon in the apps folder and it takes me directly to the welcome screen. All my other apps seem to be working just fine... Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Jimmy If I go into application manager, it shows the following... Total: 6.28mb Application: 6.14mb USB Storage app: 0.00mb Data: 140kb Sd card: 0.00mb. (I have no ad card in the phone) The sprint s3 info...

		In my opinion an &quot;Exit&quot; option in menu is good feature for all Android apps, in order to stop the service inmediatedly and free memory when email is not being used. I like to see that K9 sometimes disappear from services in use after few minutes, and probabily 16MB of K9 is not much memory in devices with 1Gb or 512 but it in devices with 256MB anything in memory has impact in performance.

		While figuring out #613 I noticed three folders named &quot;Outbox&quot;. One was the remote folder but two entries led to the same local folder. After trying 'recreate' on the account's data, I ended up with triplicate entries for the spam folder. I ended up deleting and re-creating the account; it's working fine now. Still wanted to report the behavior though.

		I have three email accounts, which were before listed like this: AccountA
AccountB
AccountC
 After long-pressing the last account and choosing &quot;Move up&quot;, I got two copies of the account that I tried to move, like this: AccountA
AccountC
AccountB
AccountC
 This state persisted after restarting the app (I think, the app was not listed in task manager), but problem went away after restarting phone, and AccountC is now in the middle as expected. Problem is not reproducible, I can now move them around as I please. When I had the problem I moved the account shortly after creating it. K-9 Mail version: 5.004 Android version: 4.4.2 Phone: LG G2

		Hello, This resource leak report, included with comments below, were found by running Facebook's Infer static analyzer on K-9. Regards, Dulma Rodriguez Facebook Static Analysis Tools Team File: k9mail/src/androidTest/java/com/fsck/k9/helper/HtmlConverterTest.java Report: Resource Leak: resource acquired by call to FileWriter(...) at line 143 is not released after line 147. Remarks: The problem seems to be that out.write(...) can throw an exception, in which case out.close() won't get called. A simple fix is to put the call to close in a finally clause.

		Good evening @k9mail developers! While I am still waiting for Dark Mail (website) to come out, I have switched to ProtonMail for now, which offers a double encryption using RSA-2048 and AES-256 as described in their security features. Even though they're developing their service with heart-blood and have a GitHub account @ProtonMail, their source code is not available (yet). Nevertheless, I would love to be able to use ProtonMail through the k-9 interface on my mobile device. Means, k-9 would need to support that double encryption. Can you add this feature, please?

		I am using a Samsung Galaxy S3 on the Verizon network. When a word document is sent to me it downloads as a winmail.dat file on the S3 (it downloads just fine on my desktop as a word document so I know there is nothing wrong with the file). Why is K9 not downloading it as a word document? I think in previous years it downloaded .doc files just fine)

		The search in k-9 is sensitive to spaces. &quot;foo &quot; will not find emails where &quot;foo&quot; is a the end of the line with a line break afterwards. Given that Android's autocomplete puts a space immediately after the word when you select something, it would be nice to have a trim() -like call on the search field before executing the search.

		My friend is no longer able to decrypt newly sent messages using K-9 mail 5.005 with OpenKeyChain 3.2 on Android 4.4.3. I took a look at some messages from my friend and they were only encrypted with the public key of the recipient, and not the key of the sender. I'm not sure if this is a bug that should be filed on OpenKeyChain's side, I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this.

		The current list of cipher suites leaves out the GCM cipher suites, which are more secure than the CBC cipher suites, as they avoid the inherent issues with verifying padding. In fact, HTTP/2 explicitly forbids non-AEAD cipher suites. k-9 is the largest user of non-GCM cipher suites on my network, so it would be nice if they could be added to the list.

		What steps will reproduce the problem? Tap in the reply area, so the keyboard opens Tap in the area of the attached message quickly start typing before the keyboard disappears -&gt; K9mail has stopped working. What do you expect to have happen? No crash, or that keyboard disappears more quickly, or that current message gets saved before K9-Mail crashes. What version of K-9 are you using? 5.005 What is your device and what version of Android are you using? Fairphone FP1 (MT6589 chipset) Android 4.2.2 What else should we know? The crash produces no entry in the log (using CatLog on the rooted phone). We have discussed this in the Fairphone Forum and the issue seems quite reproducible: https://forum.fairphone.com/t/k9-mail-crashes-when-trying-to-type-in-area-of-attached-mail/5899

		On both my Cyanogen devices (Nexus 7 2013 and Motorola G2 2015) K9 5.10x versions are almost stuck when it come to display or to scroll the list of messages. Typical symptoms includes 'progress swirl' freezes for tenths of seconds before the list of messages is visible, scrolling the list bynswiping can take similar time to actually start scrolling I've been able to go back untile 5.104 with the same behavior. Stable branch still not tested but will do soon Any ideas how to debug the issue?

		I'm not sure if this issue is fixed somewhere, or known about. But I'm using 5.105 with settings exported from the Play Store version and then imported. Android version is 4.4. When I reply or reply all, the reply to address isn't entered, and the from address is always the first listed email address in my K-9 mail, not the one attached to the inbox or conversation in question.

		Hi, at opening S/MIME encrypted mails the setMessage() method gets null instead of a messageViewInfo Object (https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/blob/master/k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/ui/messageview/MessageTopView.java#L81). As the result line https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/blob/master/k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/ui/messageview/MessageTopView.java#L87 fails, because there is no field name &quot;message&quot; that could be accessed.

		Hi! There is a bug with cyrillic symbols displaying. I'm afraid to make a mistake in the exact wording of the error, so here is an example. I get a letter in the title or body which has the word &quot;–†–æ—É—Ç–µ—Ä&quot;. Translated, it means &quot;Router&quot;. But this word is displayed as &quot;√ê¬†√ê¬æ√ë∆í√ë‚Äö√ê¬µ√ë‚Ç¨&quot;. To reproduce this error and find way to fix it, you can use the service Universal Cyrillic decoder. This service suggests that bug is: utf-8 encoding displayed as windows-1252

		If webview is completely removed from device (I am talking about removing libwebviewchromium.so), k9 mail crashes when one is trying to open a message. Is this fundamentally in design or this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Many, including myself, think that google webview is a non essential layer that represents a glaring security hole for the entire OS with very limited benefits for a user. Is there a way to break that reliance? I guess this could be done via a general intent calling an avalable web browser, such as firefox or fennec.

		I love K-9 mail and love my new LG Urbane. I correctly get notifications for new email on the watch but when I select to delete it, the confirm delete notification pops up on the phone. So it is not possible to complete the entire delete email operation from the watch. This works correctly with the Gmail application but it doesn't have a confirm delete prompt. I suppose one option would be to disable the confirm delete dialog entirely or to disable it for just the phone. Working out the most desirable behavior for using a watch to dispatch the email is the first step. I have only had this watch a few weeks and am still getting used to it. K-9 I have used for a couple of years and am very happy with. AndroidWear is just a brave new world to figure out the Right Thing To Do (tm). :)

		Scrolling the list of mails is extremely sluggish on my LG G2 (IMAP inbox, not unified or unified, 10 emails!), at least an order of magnitude slower than is the scrolling on most other apps, including complex web pages in Chrome. Scrolling the content of emails is however perfect. This makes the experience very poor and makes difficult to scroll exactly to the desired email.

			<description>
		The following bug appears fixed in latest development version (v5.107). Since I could not find anything clearly related to this on changelogs, I report this just for confirmation. I'm on a Samsung S4 (I9505) running stock Android v5.0.1. Using K-9 v5.006, a read status change (and even deletion) applied on a different device is not entirely propagated to mobile: the &quot;new mail&quot; notification would not automatically disappear, even after manual pull/refresh. This problem is not limited to lock screen, but to status-bar and notifications-menu too, where the notification would reside in indefinitely. Opening this dead notification, in case of email deletion, leads to an empty message dated to Unix epoch time (1970). I tried the latest development version (5.107) and can confirm this problem is fixed. Thanks for the great work.

		I saw an old feature request on the Google Code site where someone from the Guardian Project indicated plans to add Orbot/proxy support to K-9 mail. Has there been any movement on this? If not, how challenging would this be to implement? My coding experience is not extensive, but I'm ready to spend the time necessary to figure out how to do this if no one else is working on it and if it's not a horribly advanced project.

		The most secure authentication supported by K9 is currently CRAM-MD5, which has been cryptographically broken since 1996. Although it does have some worrying collision attacks, SCRAM-SHA1 would be a much better replacement, and is widely supported by many popular POP3 and SMTP daemons.

		Adding the menu point 'Unified Sent' in the 'Accounts' overview, in between 'Unified Inbox' and 'All messages', would complete the usage scenario. While sent messages can be found in 'All messages' and in the respective detail view of the accounts, same applies to received messages. Therefore it would be consequent and balanced to have unified views of Inbox, Sent and All. I assume it wouldn't be technically challenging to realize but unfortunately I'm lacking the programming experience to create the pull request with respective coding. In any case, K-9 Mail is nothing short of amazing, thanks a lot creators and developer community!

		Hello all together. Today i've tried https://emailprivacytester.com/ to test the privacy leaks of my mail programs. K-9 was also tested and it turns out, that if you open a mail with a html meta refresh in it, it opens the desired URL fully automaticly with the default browser. I don't know if this is a desired behaviour but i think, it is a huge potential risk for every user. Maybe you can bind the loading of meta-tags with the request if a user wants to load pictures? Greetings, sqozz

POP3 does not have folders. (The local client can have folders but the server does not. This is one of the reasons why IMAP has become much more widely used.)

And of course every time the same errors. How do I fix that/delete this cron? Current version of k9 5.0006 with kitkat 4.4.4

We compile the k9 master and everything is ok but when I open grouped messages, the application stopped. follows the error log: 08-03 09:49:07.930 688-688/com.fsck.k9.emailars.debug E/AndroidRuntimeÔπï FATAL EXCEPTION: main java.lang.NullPointerException at com.fsck.k9.ui.messageview.MessageTopView.setMessage(MessageTopView.java:86) at com.fsck.k9.ui.messageview.MessageViewFragment.showMessage(MessageViewFragment.java:282) at com.fsck.k9.ui.messageview.MessageViewFragment.onDecodeMessageFinished(MessageViewFragment.java:277) at com.fsck.k9.ui.messageview.MessageViewFragment.access$1200(MessageViewFragment.java:56) at com.fsck.k9.ui.messageview.MessageViewFragment$DecodeMessageLoaderCallback.onLoadFinished(MessageViewFragment.java:756) at com.fsck.k9.ui.messageview.MessageViewFragment$DecodeMessageLoaderCallback.onLoadFinished(MessageViewFragment.java:746) at android.app.LoaderManagerImpl$LoaderInfo.callOnLoadFinished(LoaderManager.java:438) at android.app.LoaderManagerImpl$LoaderInfo.onLoadComplete(LoaderManager.java:406) at android.content.Loader.deliverResult(Loader.java:125) at com.fsck.k9.ui.message.DecodeMessageLoader.deliverResult(DecodeMessageLoader.java:40) at com.fsck.k9.ui.message.DecodeMessageLoader.deliverResult(DecodeMessageLoader.java:15) at android.content.AsyncTaskLoader.dispatchOnLoadComplete(AsyncTaskLoader.java:236) at android.content.AsyncTaskLoader$LoadTask.onPostExecute(AsyncTaskLoader.java:76) at android.os.AsyncTask.finish(AsyncTask.java:602) at android.os.AsyncTask.access$600(AsyncTask.java:156) at android.os.AsyncTask$InternalHandler.handleMessage(AsyncTask.java:615) at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99) at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137) at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4424) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:511) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:784) at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:551) at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)

		If I compile K9 and install on my phone, select the OpenKeyChain provider, and my key and then receive a Signed Mail, K9 says me that the mail is signed but he does not have the key, so i presso &quot;lookup&quot;, it searchs the key, download It (via OpenKeyChain) and when it turn back to K9, my mail is not &quot;signed&quot; yet, but if i exit the mail view fragment and re-open the mail, now it see the key on OpenKeyChain and verify the Sign, just like if It returns after download It does not refresh the fragment view. How can I fix that? please help, I'm going crazy .

		We need a possibility to connect to the mail server via a proxy server. At the moment, there is no possibility to get the mails in networks that are set to use a proxy (e.g. many networks at University, Tor etc). I would add that proxy support should be added in a &quot;per account&quot; basis.

		I've had this issue a few times in the last few years and was never sure what triggered it. The option specifically that I've seen change is Account options-&gt;Fetching mail-&gt;When I delete a message. This gets reset to 'Delete from server'. I use my desktop computer to store my emails so I can back it up, but only check it there every few weeks. I use my phone to read and reply normally and just delete them locally knowing they will arrive on my PC to be archived eventually. I've lost weeks of emails due to this setting changing unexpectedly before. I'm using IMAP but I believe it happens via POP3 as well.

		I had this happening twice on my own debug-build of k-9 version 5.106. At first I though it was somehow related to my changes (see pull request #725), but I can reproduce it with a build from master branch, corresponding to v 5.106. It works on 5.006, official version, instead. All other messages display fine, apart from these two sent by the same sender (my dentist üòè ) and hence formatted similarly. The message is in MIME multipart, with the text in HTML format and three images attached and transferred in Base64. K-9 tells me that there is a new message in my inbox and I can see the message heading in the message view. When I try to open it, the view is completely blank. Well, I reproduced it with adb/logcat on and you can reed the exception below. So in summary: It is reproducible It happens on builds from trunk it looks like a bug the same message displays fine on the official 5.006 version from Google play I am happy to try to fix it in the coming weeks if no one is available. And here is the error: 08-08 18:34:24.798 E/k9      (23103): Error while loading message from database

		Using K9 from PlayStore, v5.006, Samsung Galaxy S5. Open a WhatsApp chat where you received an image. Push for a long time on image to select it, choose to share with K9. K9 will compose and send the message, but the image attachment is unreadable for the recipient. The problem does not appear when you single tap on a WhatsApp image to zoom it, and then share from here. Analyzing the received email: K9 is encoding the attachment with Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit, but I think the 8bit body is not correct, because it contains \r\n in the wrong position, not permitted by MIME RFC 2045 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-2.8 I think K9 should encode attachments in the usual base64 way. Also posted here Google Code

		It seems K-9 Mail is not using the standard Downloads folder. Instead stuff is downloaded into the root of the internal storage. This results in some issues opening files up from other apps.

		How was this bug caught: started composing a mail attached 4 photos using the standard attach feature of K9 (button) K-9 showed as if it fully succeeded, a mail was sent and it has 4 photos attached inside. The problem: all photos are copies of the last photo. They have identical contets, identical size but not identical names (names are correct). Expected: fail to send the message or send 4 different attachments. Reproducible? - No. I could not reproduce the problem: sending a message with the same 4 photos went OK. Photos have correct contents but the same names as in the first attempt. Verification, why trust this bug report: the names of the attachments are correct, these are 4 different photos. In case of a human mistake (attaching the same photo 4 times) there would be 4 identical names.

		When I receive an email that is sorted in several folders, the notification I receive tells me I have two (or more, actually as many as folders containing the email) unread messages even though I have just one. I mostly see that with my redirected addresses as emails go into both inbox and the folder for my redirected addresses.

		I have a folder structure with 3 or 4 levels of (sub-)folders in my IMAP account. After configuring all the folders (display class, sync class, push class, ...) I exported the settings and imported them on my new phone, but only the settings for the top level folders where transferred. I checked the k9s file and saw that only the top level folders where exported. I edited the file and added all my folders (with a script) and imported that file after clearing the K9 data. This time, all settings were imported. So the export skips sub-folders but the import (fortunately) does not. Sub-folders should also be exported. I tested this with v5.006 and v5.107 on Nexus 5 with stock Android 5.1.1.

		K-9 Mail happily accepts not only self-signed certificates without raising any questions, but also expired certificates. This should definitely be NOT the case, since it renders the whole authentication useless and MitM becomes possible by introducing fake and/or self-signed certificates. Verifying the validity of certificates is essential to the SSL/TLS system, otherwise it is pretty much useless.

		It happens from time to time that k9 mail is not able to reach the server and keeps the checking mail notification for ever. I observed this i.e. in wifi networks that have no uplink. Sometimes when i force k9 mail to pull mails in such a network (of course by mistake) that the &quot;cheking mail&quot; notification pops up and stays until i reboot the phone. Killing k9mail via the app settings dialog of android is not helping. It also stays there after k9 successfully pulled mails trough a different wifi network. I'm running k9 on an nexus 5 with android 5.1.1 the mail server on the other side is a dovecot imap on debian old stable. Latest k9 version tested is 5.006 from fdroid.

		Expected behaviour After having set up the first mail account server, I wanted to set up the SMTP server, which is different from the incoming mail server and uses a different user name and password. Actual behaviour The SMTP server is changed (no unexpected behaviour), and then when I modify the user name or start to modify the password the screen gets black or freezes and then gets black. The message that K-9 stopped appears. Steps to reproduce 1.Setup first incoming mail account 2.Trying to setup the SMTP server account K-9 Mail crashes. 3. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.006 Android version: 4.1.2 (no newer version provided by my ISP) Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Hi, It seems my email provider domain name is not known to K9 account auto config. How do I add my email provider server configuration to happen automatically in K9 ? Is it based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration ? Is https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/An-user-friendly-account-set-up-wizard-with-automatic-settings-detection-mechanisms implemented or maintained ?

		Just reviving this old issue from Google Code. Seems like the most recent version of k9 doesn't support this yet. Also seems to be suggested that this is quite easy to resolve. Old report: https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/issues/detail?id=4814 Manifest change: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14111052/adding-multi-window-support-to-android-application/14185426#14185426 I would be more than happy to help test. Thanks for your work and consideration!

		Hi, When a .gz attachment is opened in k9, the MIME type gets set to text/plain. The mime type should be set based on the file extension. Thanks for all you great work building this app. It's my primary client on Android and I have even worked on the source to help create a visual voicemail client with another developer. The only thing that I find a bit buggy is remote search. If you point me to the right files I'm happy to work on these issues.

		When replying to encrypted mail, the decrypted mail body should be used as quote rather than the inline PGP. Ideally, there should be a message asking whether to use the decrypted Text or remove the quote entirely, because sending a full-quote back unencrypted may be a privacy issue.

		I had written a mail to service@oppodigital.com and the answer is visible for a second or less and will be overlain by the result of OpenKeychain. The reasone seem to be that in the answer mail from oppodigital.com, there is a line with &quot;________________________________________&quot; and after this my orignal mail starting with &quot;From: bitstreamout bitstreamout@gmail.com&quot;, the line with the Sent date as well as the To, the Subject line, an empty line , and the &quot;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----&quot; causes that k9mail starts OpenKeychain to verify the signature (which is OK) but then erase the mail body with the result. This I've tested also with the alpah version v5.107. If required I can attach a compressed version of the orignal mail. bitstreamout

		Hi, Developers of k9mail/k-9, I am writing to report a race issue on use of ConcurrentHashMap. The issue is reported by our tool in an automatic way. Although manually confirmed, it would be a false positive, given we do not know the specification of the program. We would very appreciate if you could check below for details and confirm with us whether it is a real problem. For more information, please refer to our website: http://sav.sutd.edu.sg/?page_id=2845 File: k9mail/k-9/k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/controller/MessagingController.java Location: Line (4600/4603, 5131) Description: The get-then-put operations (line 4600, 4603) in method &quot;getNotificationData&quot; are synchronized on lock &quot;notificationData&quot;. If the intention is to guarantee the atomicity of the get-then-put operations, then the remove operation in line 5130 may break this atomicity. Relying on the ConcurrentHashMap to ensure exclusive access is dangerous since ConcurrentHashMap has no guarantee of exclusive access.

		Expected behaviour Receive a email with a image,k9 look good,with a image in content view and a image in the attachment view. But 1.can not open when click open btn(cause the attachment mime type:application/octet-stream) 2.when long click the image in content view,pop the menu for view or save the image,two func does not work(cause the uri may be correct) Actual behaviour 1.the image should be open exactly 2.when long click the image,the image should be view or open Steps to reproduce 1.get a mail with photo in content 2.open k9 to view this mail 3.click the save btn in attachment view/ long click the image in content view to show the menu option for view or open the image.

How to reproduce (method 2): Go to the inbox Click on a mail that is part of a thread From now on only mail that are part of the thread are shown Select all Mails Choose the &quot;delete&quot; action in order to delete all mails What might happen (seems for some reason not to happen if I try to create a test thread by sending mails back and forth without receiving messages that are not part of the thread and doing other stuff with the phone inbetween) either shows me a screen which is empty except of the title and the bottom line (which might be intended: The thread I am currently viewing is actually empty) or goes back to the folder I came from or crashes or shows me the mails of the thread as if they weren't deleted. Crashes happen only about 10% of the time. I assume that a check that tests if there are mails to visualize is missing. This crash has been around for a while and can still be reproduced in the current alpha version (201509259). Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.107 Android version: 4.4.1, 5.0, 4.1,...

		I hope the subject explains the issue well. In more detail: say you have 3 IMAP accounts and you want to see new messages in one of them. Once you click on Account and end up in INBOX, to return back to the view of all 3 accounts, you need to click the arrow in top left corner 3 times. If you check email 10 times a day, you may need to perform this action dozens of times. I wish there was a way to do that with one move/tap. Or maybe a &quot;home&quot; icon could be added.

		Steps to reproduce: Find a mail that ends with a unique string from some time ago. So it is not local on the phone and you don't get confused by &quot;false positives&quot;. Go your account inbox Click on the search icon No local results. Click on the IMAP search button (search glass + cloud) Wait and find nothing. Example: Email Subject: &quot;Pictures from Timbuktu&quot; An IMAP search for &quot;Timbuktu&quot; returns the result. But a search for &quot;Timbuktu &quot; does not. This is a really big problem. Because many android keyboards easily add a trailing whitespace when you don't want it, or when you use the word completion to save a few letters typing.

		Hi, I noticed that, after the last update, the bottom action bar was moved to the top of the screen, merged with the title bar. While I understand that this saves screen space, it is annoying for users with big screens as they have to either move their thumb to the very top of the screen, or use two hands. I'm not asking to throw your decision to merge the bars away, but to give users the choice whether to have a bar in the bottom or not. Thank you.

		Had K9 for a very long time. I read my gmail with pop from 2 different clients, K9 on phone and Outlook on PC. The outlook client is configured to server delete. K9 is configured not to server delete or sync server deletions. I keep things on my phone that I have to manage, appts, etc, but I pull them off of gmail and archive them on outlook. For literally years, this worked great and emails stayed on my phone forever until I explicitly deleted them. Suddenly, my phone gets purged constantly. Please help.

		I have a weird issue. Frequently, notifications for received mails (gmail account) keep disappearing. Screen is off, mail comes, sound is played (often only a part), LED blinks once and thats it. after turning the screen on there is no notification bar entry, BUT account widget (envelope) shows correct count. it is slso inconsistent, happens sometimes, other times notification shows up and stays. KDE Connect and Skins have access to notifications, but it is only this app suffering from this. also disabling those improved nothing. Did not happen in CM 11 or pre 5.00x versions, Is there anything I can do to help resolve this? logs, etc? Cyanogenmod 12.1, K9 5.006 from play store.

		Expected behaviour There should be some way to disable any sound / vibration for k-9 notifications Actual behaviour Since updating K-9 to Version 5.006 notifications (mail received, mail being sent) cause a vibration buzz. Before that all mail notifications were quiet. I've changed the &quot;Quiet time&quot; setting to 00:00-23:59 (previously unset), but to no effect. In the account settings vibration for notifications is disabled and no ringtone is set. Disabling all notification sound+buzz in the device settings doesn't change anything -- mails still cause vibration. Since I do want buzzing for SMS this wouldn't be a real workaround anyway.

		K-9 Mail fails to communicate with the server for sending messages using STARTTLS under Android 6.0. The problem appears to be with the key exchange by the SSL library. I don't know if this is partly caused by Google's migration from OpenSSL to BoringSSL, but K-9 seems to be the only program giving me problems right now. Here is the relevant logcat: 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : Error while testing settings 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : com.fsck.k9.mail.CertificateValidationException: Handshake failed 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.SmtpTransport.open(SmtpTransport.java:414) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.fsck.k9.activity.setup.AccountSetupCheckSettings$1.run(AccountSetupCheckSettings.java:146) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Handshake failed 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:396) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLSocketImpl.waitForHandshake(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:629) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLSocketImpl.getInputStream(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:591) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.SmtpTransport.open(SmtpTransport.java:284) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : ... 1 more 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: SSL handshake aborted: ssl=0x9d596fc0: Failure in SSL library, usually a protocol error 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : error:100c1069:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_key_exchange:BAD_DH_P_LENGTH (external/boringssl/src/ssl/s3_clnt.c:1193 0xab21d50f:0x00000000) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.android.org.conscrypt.NativeCrypto.SSL_do_handshake(Native Method) 10-07 15:57:48.501 3754 9300 E k9 : at com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:324)

		Sometime in the last 16 hours, the ability for me to send email via cellular data has stopped working. Sending only works when connected to wifi. Receiving works just fine. I can send with same email account via cellular with an apple device using the gmail app. This is the error message: K9-Mail version: 5.006 Device make: samsung Device model: SM-G900V Android version: 5.0 com.fsck.k9.mail.MessagingException: Unable to open connection to SMTP server. at com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.SmtpTransport.open(SmtpTransport.java:419) at com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.SmtpTransport.sendMessageTo(SmtpTransport.java:504) at com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.SmtpTransport.sendMessage(SmtpTransport.java:495) at com.fsck.k9.controller.MessagingController.sendPendingMessagesSynchronous(MessagingController.java:3563) at com.fsck.k9.controller.MessagingController$20.run(MessagingController.java:3314) at com.fsck.k9.controller.MessagingController.run(MessagingController.java:435) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:818) Caused by: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: failed to connect to smtp.gmail.com/2607:f8b0:4002:c06::6d (port 465) after 10000ms at libcore.io.IoBridge.connectErrno(IoBridge.java:169) at libcore.io.IoBridge.connect(IoBridge.java:122) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connect(PlainSocketImpl.java:183) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connect(PlainSocketImpl.java:456) at java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:882) at com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.SmtpTransport.open(SmtpTransport.java:228)

		When I set to sync IMAP with less than 100 emails, no problem. But I need to find older emails so I sync with approx 2500 emails in the inbox. I'm using an SSL IMAP connection. Frequently the app crashes. I'm running the latest version of k9mail on android 4.2.2 on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 GT-N5100. I don't have root, so logs are inaccessible due to permissions. When I have time I'll connect to my Linux box and try to obtain logs for you.

		The signature is auto-populated, what makes a nice advertizing for K9, and yes, i think other apps (ios?) do that too. But it would be nice to inform the user about that step by showing a pre-populated form in the wizard, so ppl are aware of it more and can easily change it.

		It is now three or four times it happens: I go to Portugal or Spain (I live in Italy) and if I try to connect via wifi or an international sim card (Estonian roaming sim or Belgian) google sends me an email/sms stating there's an unauthorized attempt to access my mail account. Moreover, from that moment on, k9 mail is denied access to my mail account. I have reserched the net and discovered several posts here and there concerning this issue. First of all my wife doesn't get this error while I get locked instead! Then I read that basically google considers k9 mail an unsecure client and doesn't like it, hence the lock. Is this true, and if so, why? Third, someone told me that these issue don't normally happen if you, in similar circumstances, use the stock email client. Thanks in advance for all replies and advice. Ps. I also tried to log into my account via browser from my phone but even if I accessed this way without problems, k9 still did not work. Any idea?

		Recent phones from Motorola have this super-cool feature called Moto Active Display (http://youtu.be/3TMycL9mzpg) and it works great with plenty of apps, but unfortunately not with K9. What works: Sound is played Notification sits on notification bar when phone is unlocked. What doesn't: Notification doesn't appear on Moto Active Display screen. Moto G 2015 with stock firmware

		I'm having an issue where if I create or edit a draft, it saves fine, and then shows up in the folder fine (with a preview of the message body), but when I click it from that folder view, it is blank when it opens. Nothing I can do after that will make it open correctly (ie refreshing the folder). The draft still appears on my other devices (pc) without error. If I make an edit then to the blank message, and it asks me to either save or discard, saving will still overwrite the correct draft, and discard will delete it from the server. If I simply click Back to go back to the folder list, and then open and re-save the draft on my pc, it will refresh in k9 and I can open it ok. This issue is not happening every time I open drafts, but is often now. Had no issues prior to updating to the new version (a few weeks ago?), and has been happening ever since.

		Using the current master branch I'm trying to decrypt PGP/MIME mails using OpenKeychain. When I open the message, K9 correctly starts OpenKeychain which lets me enter my PIN and then asks me to hold my YubiKey NEO to the NFC scanner. After the decryption is done, I remove the key and OpenKeychain gives control back to K9 which in turn opens OpenKeychain again. This repeats forever. When I click &quot;Cancel&quot;, it stops the loop but also crashes K9 (probably issue ##588).

		I have a pop3 account in K-9. I synchronize mails in K-9 while I have more mails on the server side than K-9 will download. I now delete 5 messages from K-9. I sync again, if the mails on the server side stayed the same, K-9 will now download mails from/at the old end. Presumably to reach its quota of mails. A notification is then also put out for these old mails which can be confusing. Fix: do not download mails that are older than the oldest mail already in an account.

		I have two email accounts, both set up using IMAP: my normal one being [myname]@mvps.org, which I've had for years; and a secondary one which I've just added, which is [myname]@hotmail.co.uk. If I receive an email in my mvps.org account, it appears in my K9-Mail inbox instantly (i.e. the moment it arrives on the mail server it also appears in my K9-Mail inbox). But if I receive an email in my hotmail account, it doesn't appear in my K9-Mail inbox unless I go into the inbox and press &quot;Refresh&quot;. I don't get this problem on my PC, on which my Thunderbird client picks up emails from both email addresses as soon as they are appear on the relevant mail server. Also, if I delete an email from my K9-Mail inbox, then if it is an email from my mvps.org account, it is immediately deleted from the mail server as well; but if it is an email from my hotmail account, then it doesn't get deleted from the mail server. And yet, under Account Settings, &quot;When I delete a message&quot; is set to &quot;Delete from server&quot;; and &quot;Erase deleted messages on server&quot; is set to &quot;Immediately. Again, I don't get this problem on my PC, on which, if I delete an email in my Thunderbird client, regardless of whether it's an mvps.org email or a hotmail email, the message is immediately deleted on the mail server as well. Any idea why K9-Mail is synching my primary mvps.org account perfectly but is not synching my secondary hotmail.co.uk account properly? Dave

		I receive an email which crashes the app. After some research, I found that mBody for the file Version_texte.txt is null (LocalBodyPart with minetype &quot;text/plain&quot;) and OpenPgpUtils.parseMessage crashes with a null value. I also tried a new email with this file but mBody is not null. So I think the issue is located in the loading process. You can find the mail here : http://guillaume.smaha.net/contrib/k9mail/TestCrashEmail.eml

		When setting up a new account, currently the user name field is pre-populated with the user-name part from the mail address entered at step one (the part before the @). But all mail accounts i have ever used since many years, now want the full mail address as user name. Am i using only untypical mail services? Or could the default be changed to pre-populating with the full mail address?

		On some Google business accounts I receive the following message when I log in with K-9 mail. Someone just tried to sign in to your Google Account xyz@xyz.com from an app that doesn't meet modern security standards. Details: Tuesday, October 27, 2015 11:37 AM (GMT) We strongly recommend that you use a secure app, like Gmail, to access your account. All apps made by Google meet these security standards. Using a less secure app, on the other hand, could leave your account vulnerable. Learn more. Google stopped this sign-in attempt, but you should review your recently used devices:

		K9 doesn't save the signature in the draft. Therefore it forgets changes in the signature that were made for this particular email. And it saves quotations from previous emails to the draft even if you clicked on the x to not include them. If you reopen the draft with K9 Mail the signature will be the default one again. If you open it with another email program (IMAP) it won't display any signature at all (at least Thunderbird didn't)

		K9 mail client crashes almost every time I delete mail from my inbox. Especially bulk delete. I've done the basic things one would do to fix. Reinstall, delete and recreate account. There is plenty of disc space on my device. I've enabled debugging. I don't know what else to do. Can you help please?

		For sending of encrypted mail, the recipient picker should be crypto-aware. There are a couple of things to consider, and some design choices to make. Let's-a go: So first off, the material way to go is chips. There are a couple of libraries for that, in OpenKeychain we use TokenAutoComplete, which is mature and flexible but not quite material-design. There are also libraries based on Google's internal chips library from the GMail app, like android-chips, but those aren't really made to be anything else but regular contact pickers and I havn't found one which looked mature. Since material design in k-9 isn't really there yet anyways, I would go with the more established and maintained option here, i.e. TokenAutoComplete. So, what do we actually want to show in the list? At the moment, a list of e-mail addresses (not contacts) is shown, queried from ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Email. This is the obvious thing to show, and it seems more reasonable than a list of contacts so I would just keep it that way. What I would like to add is an annotation to each address about its crypto-status. In OpenKeychain, we have icons to show the key status - a green checkmark, yellow question mark, and some red ones for revoked/expired/unsuitable for operation. The problem is, outside of an explicit crypto context, it's not clear that these icons are about the status of some encryption key, so we really can't use them here. We also don't need info about special states of a key - revoked or expired keys are simply irrelevant for recipient selection. My proposal would be to use Threema's concept: Three dots, with three states &quot;one in red&quot; / &quot;two in yellow&quot; / &quot;three in green&quot;, all others greyed out. Check out ma mock-up. The idea is to be mildly alarming (&quot;just one of three&quot;), but also suggest a way to progress (&quot;key available, two out of three&quot;, &quot;verified that thing, three out of three!&quot;). A different approach would be a lock in different states (red/yellow/green with open / closed+questionmark / closed+checkmark), but I'm a) missing the progress aspect of the three-dots concept, and b) an open red lock next to each mail address is just a tad too alarming - if the UI tells the user &quot;this is unsafe!&quot;, they might just migrate to a different program which is equally unsafe but does nothing to inform the user about that fact. Some more thoughts: if a valid (or even confirmed) key is available, the user will likely want to encrypt - optimize for that. encryption without signing is not a reasonable use case and I would not support it. pgp/mime vs pgp/inline is an orthogonal problem to everything mentioned here, I would leave it for later do we need a contact-picker-button? the gmail app removed theirs recently. If we do, the information it displays should be identical to the dropdown.

		Using the most recent K9 client on the most recent Cyanogenmod stable release on a Nexus 7 device, and using IMAP accounts, sometimes the sync notification with the clockwise-turning circular arrow animation is displayed infinitely. As far as I have investigated, this issue happens when there is a successfully established WiFi connection into a network that has no Internet connectivity. The notification persists in the tray even if K9 is stopped and restarted. It also persists even if K9 regains Internet access and successfully syncs the mail accounts. In this case, a second, similar notification is displayed just below the infinitely running notification in the tray, for the duration of the successful synchronization. To get rid of the infinitely running notification, I have to reboot the device. Maybe the hard killing of process remnants using the Terminal also helps but I have not yet tried this solution.

		I have this issue and cannot find any bugs (closed or open) here just on the old code.google.com website. As I still have this issue I guess it was not fixed, so I would like to report it here. (I have updated it with my device information) What steps will reproduce the problem? 1.Using OpenKeychain and K-9 Mail, send a signed e-mail to someone not using PGP 2.Have them respond to your e-mail, with their client quoting the entire message 3.K-9 mail receives the message, displays it for a moment, then the signature is being analyized and from then on only the part below the beginning of the signature is being displayed, i.e. the actual replay can't be displayed in K-9 Mail What do you expect to have happen? First of all, K-9 mail should not recognize the signature (my signature) in the quoted part as valid and tell me, that the reply e-mail is signed. Second of all, it should in any case also display the rest of the e-mail (the reply above the quoted e-mail). If I view the e-mail in Thunderbird (with the Enigmail addon)everything is displayed correctly: First the reply, then the quote - first the info-part (from, to, sent, subject), then the line &quot;********* BEGIN ENCRYPTED or SIGNED PART *********&quot;, and then the content of my original e-mail. What do you see instead? Only the quoted part, aka my original e-mail. What version of K-9 are you using? version 5.002 What is your device and what version of Android are you using? HTC M8, Android version 5.0.1 Is your email account a POP account, Exchange Account or an IMAP account? IMAP Original bug report: https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/issues/detail?id=6745

		Hello ... I have K9 Mail on my android based Note 5 and I wanted to move something that I accidently moved to the trash back out of the trash to the inbox ... according to the manual this should be doable via the long press popup menu ... however ... when I long press I get a very abbreviated version of the that menu and it dose not scroll to show me other options ... the move command and the many others are not showing ... I was able to forward the mail to myself again but that is a rather inept way of doing this ... how do I get the commands to shoe on the long press menu ... I should include that this is an issue in my POP3 account but not in my Gmail account ...

		I created a contact group of 140 members for my party invitation. I want to a send an email message to all the members of this group. Contact group selection is capped at 100 entries. Maybe there is a good reason for this, or maybe it's arbitrary. As a work around, I selected the first 100, then individually hand selected the last 40 and joined the resulting addresses manually. Can me make that cap value a settings parameter? Or can we create a new function to copy the email addresses of a group to the clipboard? Or we would make it possible to select a range of contacts so I don't need to check for example 40 boxes individually. In short, contact groups don't scale well yet.

		This is kind of hard to trigger. But it can be triggered at least on a Wiko Bloom and a Samsung Galaxy Note I: Read something in full-screen mode using the kindle app As soon as you get a notification for a mail that is part of a thread you have other mails of in your inbox tap the middle of the screen (which causes the notification bar to display) and while the notification bar animation showing the mail title mail by mail is still shown open the notification bar and tap on the notification from k9. As soon as the mail appears: Press the home button. After that the mail is still in the inbox (Thunderbird will see it, the webmailer, too). But K9 Mail cannot see it anymore: It has disappeared from the inbox and the search function won't be able to find it, neither.

		Hi, I'm using K9 v 5.007 (from F-Droid) and realised there's no way to display the full titles of long emails except by opening it and then requesting to see the full headers. I would have expected to be able to touch, or maybe long touch the subject to see it in full. Hope this helps, a quick search didn't return any open issues about this. Cheers

		When answering a mail, signature is placed by default after the quoted text, which is troubblesome with long chains of mails (&gt;20 successive answers). I'd like a setting allowing to place the signature between my answer and the next instead of a the end of the mail. I am sorry if this suggestion has already been made, I didn't take the time to read every single issue report and pull request. By the way, keep up that wonderfull app running and evolving, what you guys do is just wonderful !

		This issue was mentioned already on the old Google Code issue tracker here: https://code.google.com/p/k9mail/issues/detail?id=726 Unfortunately it is obviously still not fixed as I see the same issue with wrong message sorting when using IMAP also with the latest version. Although I really like K9-Mail due to its clean interface this makes the program completely unusable for me. Is there any chance that this bug gets fixed?

		When our mail host was moved to RackSpace, I was not able to send mail from K-9 on some of my Android devices while using the LTE connection. If I enabled wi-fi, the mail was sent, otherwise, I would get an error message saying that mail could not be sent. This did not happen before our mail server moved. I read something about ipv6, and noticed that my T-Mobile connection was using an ipv6 access point. When I changed the protocol used by the access point to ipv4 (I was surprised I was able to do this), the send errors stopped. For now, this workaround works, but at some point carriers may not allow the use of ipv4. I do not know if this is only a problem with RackSpace, but it has happened on every Android device I have used when connected to an ipv6 LTE WAP.

		When my phone is connected to the internet over wi-fi, I have no trouble sending mail through a mail server hosted by Rackspace. When wi-fi is switched off, and the phone uses an LTE connection over an ipv4 AP, it can still send mail. When the phone connects to an ipv6 AP, it is not able to send mail. K-9 is able to retrieve mail from the same server under all conditions, but cannot send it under that one condition, even though no server settings are changed. Are some send mail server settings affected by ip version? Saying the configuration must be wrong is not an engineering response. If that is the case, then there must be a reason why K-9 can send mail when connected via wi-fi or ipv4 LTE, with no other changes to server settings. It's possible this is a Rackspace issue, but since I can only replicate it (every time) with K-9, it's not easy to convince them it's their issue. I have not tried this with the default Android mail client.

		I believe K-9 had a request for an update recently [a week ago or so?] and since all four devices my family owns has had these blank body/(No subject) emails randomly appear. Time-stamps are not rhythmic; totally random. Nothing changed on our end in terms of configuration so if anyone could lend a hand as to why it would be much appreciated.

		nexus 5 k9mail 5.007 previously on 5.006 - no issues prior. to make it simple. 2 email accounts affected, one business and one personal. (personal default), both gmail. i composed a new email switched to my business account, it saved to draft a few times as i as was trying to find the cheque book, i didnt leave the screen. i sent the email only to find it was sent from my personal email with the business account name. saved to my personal sent folder but with the business name/email being displayed, the replied message displays it was sent from personal so k9mail was not displaying the correct email sent from. seems like a rare occurrence and i dont know how to reproduce it. i looked in the catlog (nothing), i realized i should of enabled extra debugging. i will update if it happens again

		Hallo since long this issue in k9mail is present: when I open k9mail through a mail notification in the info bar, when having any other app opened, and after reading that mail, I go back with the Back-Key, then this won't bring me to the last opened app (from where I opened the notification), this brings me to the home screen. This is not the normal behaviour I think, other apps don't &quot;forget&quot; from where they have been started. The same thing is, when I have an app open and I open now k9mail through some kind of gesture (there are several apps doing this, e.g. &quot;Swapps&quot;). I open k9 now and when I go back with the back button, the original app has gone, I come to the home screen. The same issue I found with Threema, I guess it is the same bug. But most other apps will bring me to the last screen (when I press the backbutton), from where they had been started, either through notification shortcut or other way I opened them, always I come back with the back button to the previous screen of any previous opened app. Thank frank

Once I forward the same mail to gmail, I'm able to see attachments. Also one I log in to my e-mail account from PC (RoundCoube) I'm able to see attachments. It is something how K9-mail interprets these attachments. Mail type IMAP.

		ACE is a community of companies who are trying to standardize EMM settings for mobile applications. Would be awesome if k-9 would implement some of these features. What this would allow, for example; the app could be pushed and installed from AirWatch and the users settings (like exchange user/pass/domain/server/encryption) automatically pushed from AirAatch and configured in k-9 with no user or IT intervention. Very useful in a large organization with an EMM solution in place. http://www.appconfigforenterprise.org Technical requirements: Application must define application restrictions in AndroidManifest.xml Register a receiver for the ACTION_APPLICATION_RESTRICTIONS_CHANGED broadcast action Read and apply restrictions using UserManager.getApplicationRestrictions() immediately after first launch of the application, and whenever the restrictions change as indicated by the ACTION_APPLICATION_RESTRTICTIONS_CHANGED broadcast

		This occurs randomly, but sometimes when opening messages from the notification, K-9 opens up as expected but is simply a black screen. Pressing Back to get to the message list still shows up black, only when backing out as far as the account list does something display on screen. I'm unsure as to whether this happens from the Lock screen or normal notifications, or both (I'll try and figure out if there is any pattern to it). Current versions, but this was happening before the upgrade of both: Android 5.1 (Moto G) k9 5.007 I don't recall experiencing it under Android 4.4.

		This problem is happening on a Samsung running OS 4.4.4, and a Droid Turbo running OS 5.1. This problem occurs using IMAP with both polling or IDLE. If the connection is used every minute (either via e-mails coming in, going out, etc., or by a poll or IDLE refresh), the connection is fine. If the polling or IDLE refresh is set to anything longer than a minute, and no e-mails come in or go out, the connection stops working. Once the connection has gone unused for over a minute, any attempt to do anything with the connection (poll, send e-mail, delete an existing email) will cause K9 mail to hang up (the application still responds, but it is stuck trying to communicate with the server). I did force close K9 after waiting 25 minutes for it to give up trying to communicate with the server and/or throw an error. Once it was force stopped and re-opened, the following error was in the error folder: java.net.SocketException: recvfrom failed: ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out) at libcore.io.IoBridge.maybeThrowAfterRecvfrom(IoBridge.java:592) at libcore.io.IoBridge.recvfrom(IoBridge.java:556) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.read(PlainSocketImpl.java:485) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.access$000(PlainSocketImpl.java:37) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl$PlainSocketInputStream.read(PlainSocketImpl.java:237) at java.io.InputStream.read(InputStream.java:162) at java.io.BufferedInputStream.fillbuf(BufferedInputStream.java:149) at java.io.BufferedInputStream.read(BufferedInputStream.java:234) at com.fsck.k9.mail.filter.PeekableInputStream.peek(PeekableInputStream.java:34) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapResponseParser.readResponse(ImapResponseParser.java:42) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapResponseParser.readResponse(ImapResponseParser.java:29) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapConnection.readStatusResponse(ImapStore.java:2775) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapConnection.executeSimpleCommand(ImapStore.java:2925) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapFolder.executeSimpleCommand(ImapStore.java:862) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapFolderPusher$1.run(ImapStore.java:3151) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:818) Caused by: android.system.ErrnoException: recvfrom failed: ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out) at libcore.io.Posix.recvfromBytes(Native Method) at libcore.io.Posix.recvfrom(Posix.java:185) at libcore.io.BlockGuardOs.recvfrom(BlockGuardOs.java:250) at libcore.io.IoBridge.recvfrom(IoBridge.java:553) ... 14 more

		This is not a technical question, but I'm curious if this blurb from Kaiten mail is correct: &quot;Kaiten is based on the popular open source app K-9 Mail and was built by K-9's lead developers Jesse and Chris. By buying Kaiten you not only get an awesome email client, you also support the open source version because almost all of the new features are contributed to K-9 Mail.&quot; K-9 has seen many new releases, Kaiten seems abandoned. Are the lead developers noted above part of the current K-9 team or did I give my money to random hucksters?

		Dear K9 developers, thank you a lot for providing this great app. From my point of view, it would be nice to have the option to read full mail information in case of multiple new mails. By now this is only possible in case of a single mail. In case of more than one new mail, information and options are limited to subject and sender. This, for example, is very easy to handle with the Gmail app. This is important when using a SmartWatch like the Gear S2. Best wishes Dieter

			<description>
		I have 3 accounts in K9 and performed an export from an old device to a new device. Only one account (IMAP) worked afterwards. The two POP3 accounts did not work after import. I had to delete and recreate the accounts for the two POP3 mailboxes in order for them to work. I can provide the settings file (privately) if needed.

		full logcat while k9 hanging up.txt k9-log.txt cketti keeps closing my issues but there is clearly something wrong here. K9 is losing its connections unless it uses them every 60 seconds. This makes K9 unusable unless polling or push refresh is schedule for once per minute, which is ridiculous. This is NOT a local network issue - there is no firewall in place, and has been confirmed to occur on multiple internet providers, as well as both 3G and 4G networks, K9 also worked fine on another phone with the exact same configuration on ALL of the above networks. This is NOT an individual phone issue - see below, it is happening on multiple OS versions and devices, also a quick Google search will confirm that I am not the only person noticing this issue. Using a computer and telnet, a connection to the mail server in question from the networks in question can be left open indefinitely. At the very least, K9 should not sit around for half an hour waiting for a connection to time out before it opens a new one. But that still doesn't resolve the issue of why these connections are being lost/closed/destroyed/causing errors. Attached is a logcat obtained per the K9 bug report instructions, as well as an unfiltered LogCat while manually asking K9 to poll, causing it to hang up. This problem is happening on a Samsung running OS 4.4.4, and a Droid Turbo running OS 5.1. This problem occurs using IMAP with EITHER polling or IDLE. This problem occurs on 3G, 4G, and multiple internet connections. This problem occurs with multiple e-mail providers. If the connection is used every minute (either via e-mails coming in, going out, etc., or by a poll or IDLE refresh), the connection is fine. If the polling or IDLE refresh is set to anything longer than a minute, and no e-mails come in or go out, the connection stops working. Once the connection has gone unused for over a minute, any attempt to do anything with the connection (poll, send e-mail, delete an existing email) will cause K9 mail to hang up (the application still responds, but it is stuck trying to communicate with the server). LogCat output is attached.

		This was tested with K-9 mail v5.007 and both OpenKeychain / APG under AlienDalvik / AOSP 4.1.2: Replying to an encrypted Mail quotes the encrypted Mail still encrypted. I always wondered why K-9 mail only offers the menu entry &quot;Reply&quot; in the mail list view inside a folder, but not when viewing an individual email. This does not really matter (it is merely an inconvenience), as long as the intent is to reply to an unencrypted email. But for encrypted emails that results in the email's content being quoted encrypted, effectively rendering replies to encrypted emails useless. Or is this just either an oversight by me or the fact, that I run K9-Mail in SailfishOS's AlienDalvik (based on AOSP 4.1.2)? Kudos for your excellent work, Olf0

Surprisingly the menu of the email viewer does offer &quot;Compose&quot;, which works as announced: It opens a email composer with an fresh, empty email! To offer &quot;Reply&quot; instead of &quot;Compose&quot; in the menu of the email viewer would make much more sense though, IMO. Hence this is my k-9 mail enhancement suggestion. Kudos for your excellent work. Edit, after this issue was closed and tagged invalid by cketti: Oh, my blindness! Sorry.

		K9 needs to opt itself out of the doze feature otherwise, sync doesn't happen on a schedule and push notifications only happen when the phone is being looked at, which defeats the whole purpose of the push sync in the first place.

		Currently only a simple popup with no metric of remaining time or download speed is shown when a message is partially on the phone but the rest is fetched from the IMAP server. Especially with big messages and a slow connection some indication of how long this might take would be great. This somewhat relates to issue #574

		Hi, I'm using your email app and it's great, but now I'm having an issue with it, I just change my cell phone importing settings from old one (moto g 3) to this new (galaxy note 5), the issue is that in notifications some times show the &quot;delete&quot; button and some times not, when appear is with some email account and with others no. I'm sending a couple of screen shots so you can see issue, I don't know, probably I'm doing something wrong. Thanks. Greetings

			<description>
		Dear K9 Developers, I am implementing a hang-bug detection tool and I am analyzing K9 (master version downloaded yesterday) with it. I found that the main thread of K9, frequently calls com.fsck.k9.helper.HtmlSanitizer.sanitize at code lines 25 and 29, which correspond to clean and getAsString, respectively, often when an email is opened. In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bug) experienced with K9 while opening emails. Moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. I suspect that it is actually possible to run the &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;getAsString&quot; functions on a background thread. Therefore, do you think that it is possible to move off the main thread those functions to improve responsiveness? Thanks for any information, I hope I can help improve K9.

		Hi! I am not sure, whether this is an openkeychain issue or a k9 mail issue, that's why I'd like to post it here again: open-keychain/open-keychain#1665 I use K9 5.007 and OpenKeyChain 3.7 on my Android with CM 12.1. When I reply a mail, K9 mail adds the old message quoted like this: This is the reply mail followed by the quotation of the original mail: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- Charset: utf-8 Version: GnuPG v2 hQIMA324sfl24ltklwqfl2tl2gw However, K9 mail cannot decrypt my sent message then and Thunderbird tells me that no valid OpenPGP block could be found. This is how the sent mail looks then: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- hQIMAypJd8s8JCpBAQ//fWrPkSHfvGyh9YPbIn9OhQCOKCQM2yUusUiGbOxYPxbZ When I compare it to a working encrypted mail -----END PGP MESSAGE----- is missing here at the end of the mail. So only a part of the encrypted messages seems to be sent! How can I help you to narrow down the problem?

		Being notified that the mail accounts are being checked isn't very useful for most people. Generally people only care when they actually get new messages, not every time the server is queried. It'd be nice to be able to disable that notifiction without resorting to android's course-grained &quot;block ALL notifications from a particular app&quot;.

		When I'm on WiFi, everything works fine. When not on WiFi but on mobile broadband, K-9 cannot connect to IMAP nor to SMTP servers. However there is no general problem with internet connectivity as e.g. Firefox works normal. I'm using the most recent K-9 that's on F-Droid, and I'm running CM13.

If I delete all of my Inbox messages then choose to &quot;Empty Trash&quot; does that delete all of the messages in my Inbox on the server them empty the server trash? That seems to be happening. There is nothing in your settings or explanations that indicate that should be happening. I am trying to keep my phones Inbox clean, and save the messages on the server.

		The application works well over mobile networks and most wifi networks but, with my home wifi, manual refresh causes the app to sit continuously in what looks like 'polling' mode. The only way out of this is to close the app and restart and this then causes a successful poll. I, and visitors, do not experience any other wifi issues so I guess that it is something peculiar to my wifi set-up. Anyone any ideas? Thanks. John

		Instead of having to select an email address for the sender or the receiver, allow the user to type one in. There could also be an option to add the new address to the senders and receivers list. My domain email account allows me to generate any number of addresses. I use a different one for each recipient. I prefer just typing in the email address rather than having to create it and add it to a list. The list would be very long and it is inconvenient having to use it before an email can be sent.

		When sending emails I cannot select files. The options available does not in lude the file browser, just basically photo apps. To get around I can upload file to one drive and then select it that way, but if in cloud no reason to send via email. Can send link via one drive. If option available to share/export from an app, can choose k9 mail and send file as attachment, just cannot do it directly with k9 mail. This did not exist previously so not sure if caused by an update or something. Tried attaching screenshot. Nothing on this form to indicate wwhether it has been attached or not.

		Supporting both quoted-printable and 8bit as transport encoding is adding unnecessary complexity without much gain. Right now we use a transfer encoding of 8bit when we compose a message. And when we connect to a SMTP server that does not support 8-bit messages we have to re-encode the message right before sending. See also #582.

		Maybe is it a translation issue : When creating an account with the french version of K9mail, the default folder where are stored sent emails is &quot;Envoy√©s&quot;. Most email readers actually use the &quot;Sent&quot; folder but display a translated name for this folder in the UI : &quot;Envoy√©s&quot; or &quot;Messages envoy√©s&quot;. If they do, all email client using IMAP consequently have a common default configuration (and, for part of them, default configuration is the only configuration :( ). I have seen that I can choose the folder to save sent emails in, but it took me time to figure out what was happening, as, in the first place, it took me time to discover that I was having a problem.

		Hi there, I am trying to use K9 with an Exchange account at the popular German email provider freenet.de in order to get push mail. However, K9 v5.007 fails to connect with &quot;Cannot not connect to server (IOException)&quot;. Will attach the ADB debug. I am wondering if this is a duplicate of #606. Strange thing is that with the standard Android Email client, at least the one that comes with Android-x86 4.4, everything works fine (same provider, same settings, i.e. SSL port 443). Could it be the Android client contains code for newer Exchange servers? If that was the case can it be lifted into K9? The standard Android Email has another severe problem so it is impossible for me to use it. But I really, really need push email. IMAP idle does not seem to work with freenet. With IMAP poll, freenet takes very long to deliver, even if you poll by hand every couple of seconds, so I really would appreciate some sort of help. Thanks Dan

		Android 4.4.2 All K9 versions since 18 months HTC One M8 When a message contains an URL link, tapping on it works best is message is zoomed out (when text is small). The more you zoom in to be able to read content of message, the less chance you have to get link open on tapping it. I have tried to tap at begin of link, end, first line, last line ... it just won't open. This is specific to K9. It's not a tactile issue, because I never had that problem in an web browser.

		Android 4.4.2 HTC One M8 K9 5.007 In folder listing view. When I want to select one message, the first message I want to select, I need to tap on the small box on left on line. For following messages, I can tap anywhere in the line, near the box, or not. The issue is that I have to tap exactly in the middle of the tick box. If I tap just above, below, or left of the box, by a few pixels, the message will open, in the read view. The graphic of the tick box is fine, but the tactile space should not be exactly matching the graphics; the tactile zone should be larger than the graphics, and selection should start when I tap any place near the box; the tactile zone should be as large as the height of the message line (this height may vary with DPI). The graphic box is centered vertically; the tactile zone should spread over the full height of line, and at least as large as the height. But maybe, the tactilke zone should (maybe, debatable) go to the left edge.

		On the current git HEAD, on a device without any PGP apps installed, composing and then sending a message fails with a toast saying &quot;Signing requested, but no key selected!&quot;. The effect of this is that e-mails can't ever be sent. Looking at the code this seems to be due to line 51 of RecipientPresenter.java which checks isMissingSignKey() which is true when signingKeyId is null in the current cryptoStatus. If no PGP app is installed that value will always be null. I think the proper solution would be to have isMissingSignKey() also check if cryptoStatus.cryptoMode is CryptoMode.DISABLE and also set the currentCryptoMode, which currently defaults to CryptoMode.OPPORTUNISTIC, to default to CryptoMode.DISABLE as users without OpenPGP can't even open the menu to change modes. The following commit shows what I propose: adamsmd/k-9@1067f1b I didn't see anywhere that the current code saves a preference for currentCryptoMode. So I assume this is a feature still in development, but this change will allow users without OpenPGP to continue using and testing HEAD.

		Device: Samsung Galaxy Note5 (SM-N920V), Android 5.1.1 This is a new phone for me, and I've been customizing the home screens. I've been able to work with many other widgets, as expected: press and hold on home screen, choose widgets, press and hold widget and drag to its place. However, when I try to do that with either of the K-9 widgets, it merely opens K-9, and never drops the widget on the home screen.

		I'm syncing folders on my quad-core phone with k-9, and I have Tinycore app that shows CPU core usage. Cyanogenmod 13, &quot;sprout4&quot; device (android one smartphones) k-9 usually loads 100% a single core, gives a minor(if any) load on another and lets the other two cores remain offline (I have hotplug governor, unused cores are shut down). The point is that while synching the app does show lag and lack of responsiveness when moving in the menu and reading e-mails in another folder/account. While the rest of the phone is pretty fine, and can multitask without issues. I'm suspecting that with better multi-threading the user experience can be improved. p.s. I'm also using OpenKeychain, don't know if it is related

		When I look at an e-mail, the image (company logo of the recipient) at the bottom of the body is the wrong one. The image displayed belongs to a completely different e-mail from a completely different sender. It sounds to me that maybe the image in both e-mails have the same name and for an unknown reason, K9 do not show the correct one. I'm using K9 version 5.007 on Android version 5.1

If I have it set to 1st and 2nd, which loads between. 15 and 20 folders, K9 always crashes. It's not even downloading the folders' contents, just the folder names themselves at that point.

Actual behaviour A webpage is opened and the &quot;meta-refresh&quot; remote tracker is triggered. This can allow an attacker to load a malicious webpage. The meta-refresh tag puts the following into the html : My result: https://emailprivacytester.com/e72483a201897d0b Steps to reproduce Go to emailprivacytester.com and enter your email address.

Actual behaviour K9 sometimes (about 10% of the time) crashes Steps to reproduce Use an IMAP account Make sure that K9 cannot see immediately that an e-mail has been deleted Delete an E-Mail from outside K9 Try to open this E-Mail using K9.

		Using k9 with openkeychain has a problem. Viewing and encrypted email (which is shown as decrypted in view mail screen) and replyingto that mail results in k9 quoting the encrypted version of the original mail instead of the decrypted text. This is wrong.

		The latest version 5.008 has a problem with sending and receiving emails when using WiFi. Everything works correctly when I shut off WiFi and only use data. Version 5.007 did not have that problem. Please investigate and resolve this problem. Thank you.

		Expected behaviour From an email in K9, Click open for the .ics attachment. (the .ics is from my office, where they generate the calendar events from an outlook office calendar). I would than choose &quot;Calendar&quot; , and than I would have have a window in the resident default calendar app with the calendar event and can work with the calendar event and save it to a particular calendar account and add alarms and such. This was working correctly for about a year. Actual behaviour Now, after 1 or two K9 updates (started being a problem a few months ago IIRC)... was hoping the latest update would fix the problem, but it did not. After clicking on &quot;Calendar&quot;, I get an OS window that says &quot; Unfortunately, Calendar has stopped.&quot; Steps to reproduce Send an outlook generated .ics to an email account in K9. In the email, Click &quot;Show attachments&quot; , than &quot;more&quot; if need be, than click &quot;Open&quot;. Select &quot;Calendar&quot;. At this point I get the OS message window &quot; Unfortunately, Calendar has stopped. &quot; I am using the Calendar that comes with my phone / OS, not a 3rd party downloaded calendar. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.008 Android version: Galaxy 6 model SM-G920V OS: 5.1.1 kernel 3.10.61 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): POP3

		Hey there, I am a long time K9 user which is using K9 for almost 5 years now. Everything is working perfectly except one thing: Battery consumption is way too high when K9 is just running in the backround. I am running 2x gmail push accounts + 2x own-mail-server imap accounts on a Nexus 6 (previously Nexus 4 and HTC Desire HD). On my large Nexus 6 screen 2hours of &quot;screen on time&quot; is consuming as much or sometimes less battery than K9 which would run in the backround. On my Nexus4, K9 would sometimes completely drain the battery within 1 hour. My guess is that K9 is using so much battery because of low radio signals or being not connected to HSDPA? I tried creating a tasker script which would disable android auto-sync (which also stops auto-sync + push in K9) when the radio signal is low for a certain amount of time and only reactivate it when the signal is good again for a certain amount of time. Battery consumption is still high but better than before so I am wondering if K9 could get this feature out-of-the-box? I don't know what other ways are possible to minify battery consumption but K9 is, just right now as I am writing here, still using 1% more battery than my screen would use in those 30-40mins of writing (I am connected to WiFi at home or have full HSDPA+ signal while driving in thr car). For troubleshooting: I re-installed K9 several times (also on several devices). Sizes of e-mail accounts (if relevant): Gmail push #1: 114MB Gmail push #2: 6MB Own mail server imap #1: 331kb (syncs every 10 mins) Own mail server imap #2: 3MB (syncs every 10 mins) Thanks in advance !

		It would be nice to have an option which would pop up a warning if message being sent has no subject. While there may be occasions where no subject is what you want, it is generally considered bad form. I rarely do it, but occasionally happens when in a rush to get the email out before I get to my stop when on public transit. Kinda embarrassing.

		Currently we don't import settings files with a settings version number higher than our own. That means users often run into trouble when downgrading. Since we do strict input validation and discard unknown/invalid settings it shouldn't be a problem to allow the import of settings from a newer K-9 Mail version.

		I'm not sure if it's technically possible due to IMAP specifications, etc, but is it possible to create a download progress bar in % or so, to enable users to see how far along a large attachment download has come? Occasionally, when on patchy data connections, you kind of have to guess whether a large attachment is still downloading, or if it's maybe got stuck, since there's no indication if the download is continuing or has stalled.

		I would like to see a feature in K-9 to allow me to use &quot;Tasker&quot; to check a specific account email. Scenario is : Go to work attach to work wifi, Tasker recognizes we are at work based on Access point and starts periodically checking for email for just the work email account. Same scenario at home. Let Tasker check for home email while at home. This is allows better security as it only is trying to check my accounts in the appropriate networks and not just any ole wifi I connect too. Also this is a great app, thanks for all the work that has been put into it.

Manual setup when setting up a new email account Select Exchange (WebDAV) Fill in details, as per the instructions here. In this case, I entered the exchange server to be outlook.office364.com. It appears that there is no Domain\Username field in K-9, as there is in the tutorial, which may be of use(?) Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.008 Android version: 5.1.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): Exchange

		Could you please add a support for creating calendar events from an ICS attachment? I can currently Open or Save an attached ICS file but I cannot create an event from it. Google Calendar has this feature so in my particular case, I can work around the lacking K9 functionality by opening the attachment in K9, choosing Google Calendar and creating the event from there. Thanks

		Hello, I am using K-9 for a long time. Since the update to 5.007 there are no notification anymore for new messages. No sound, no vibrations, no LED, no icon at the status bar. Sounds like mp3 or systemsounds tested no reaction. Even when I create a new account. I am using K - 9 with five different accounts IMAP+POP, the widgets on the screen present the right quantity of new mails. I was detecting the notification problem befor x-mas 2015 and I was waiting for the next update but not affect. I am missing the sounds very much. Rest of the program seems to run perfectly. Somewhere I read that deleting an account and recreate didn¬¥t work. I hesitate to delete the complete K-9 app. Do I have to step back to a version of 4.8xx? is it even possible? Environment I am using Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (N-7100), Android 4.1.2 not rooted, K-9 (5.007) german language (actually updated 5.008) Notifications 24/7 Please help. vy73de Captain-intrepid

		Hello, having some battery consumption issues since I upgraded from Stock/Kit Kat to Cyanogen13/Marshmallow I Googled about it. I read about pushing/polling possibly beeing related to the matter, but I think the wiki here is inconsistent and thus am I somewhat lost. From this page https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/Manual-AccountSetup Enable push mail for this account: This option is only available for IMAP accounts. When it is enabled a long-lived connection to the IMAP server is established so K-9 Mail can be notified by the server when a new message has arrived. When this is set, you do not need to select a poll frequency, because you do not poll. This generally decreases power consumption in addition to decreasing delivery notification delay, and is a good enough thing that it can be worth selecting a mailbox on the ground that the provider supports IMAP IDLE. Please note that Push might require multiple connections to the IMAP server which might not be supported or undesired by the server administration. From this page https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions What is the difference between pushing and polling? Depending on what type of account you have configured, K-9 may support either push or poll for fetching new mail (see Account settings &gt; Fetching mail). At this time, K-9 only supports push for IMAP accounts. Polling refers to the mail client periodically asking the mail server for new mail, on some configured time increment. Pushing refers to the mail client keeping an open connection to the mail server, so that the server can inform the client of new mail as soon as it is received. Pushing typically uses more battery for a few reasons. First, when you have any account configured to push, this keeps an Android service running at all times. This service keeps 1 open connection to the mail server for each folder configured to push (which also uses battery power). And lastly, pushing will typically lead to more frequent communications between the client and the server. Regards.

		Have you considered setting android:installLocation=&quot;auto&quot; in AndroidManifest.xml to allow installation on external storage? According to the wiki (https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/Storage), the reason for not supporting installation on external storage is: &quot;Since Android 2.2, the system is able to install core application files on the external storage (usually a microSD card). Unfortunately, doing so makes the application unable to work when the external storage is shared, like when your device is USB-plugged. Furthermore, Android does not restart the application when the application is brought back (on USB unplug).&quot; But recent versions of Android don't unmount the external storage when the storage is shared, they use MTP.

Check K9 later and the previous read emails show as unread If I read the messages on the server via outlook client on PC, the K9 client shows them as read messages, properly from that point forward Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.008 Android version: Marshmellow LG G4 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP settings but Activesync is used on servers Note: This occurred about a week ago. I exported settings Deleted K9 from phone Downloaded new version from Play store Imported settings K9 functioned perfectly for about a week but problem returned today. Problem returned on March 18, 2016 I noted in the K9mail-errors folder there are a number of emails showing with &quot;IOException: readStringUntil(): end of stream reached&quot; And UnknownHostException: Unable to &quot;resolve host &quot;imap-mail.outlook.com&quot;:Unknown error&quot;

		Expected behaviour Type an email, save it in your Drafts folder, with the ability to schedule a &quot;Send Later&quot; date and time. (Sometimes I don't want my clients knowing I was up working at 3:30am, so I'd love to go to sleep knowing my email will auto-send at, say, 8:30am.) Actual behaviour This functionality currently does not exist. Must hit &quot;send&quot; when you want to send you email. Environment K-9 Mail version: Current Android version: Any (Lollipop. 5.1.1) Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): All account types, but IMAP is probably easiest

		Currently all IMAP/POP3/SMTP/WebDAV credentials are stored in the preferences as plain text. I would like to propose to encrypt the password(s) using the Android KeyStore API for devices with Android 4.3 (API level 18) and above. One &quot;drawback&quot; is of course that it will not be possible to include the passwords when importing/exporting the settings. http://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html üëç 1

		Expected behaviour Message should be delivered to outgoing mail server Actual behaviour Get a &quot;failed to send message&quot; error, message is put in drafts Steps to reproduce create message send Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.108 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): imap (but this is only a send issue, retrieving mail works fine). fail-to-send.txt This is against Rackspace's mail service -- secure.emailsrvr.com -- port 465 - ssl/tls They only support TLS1.0 and above. Picking up mail from their server works fine, as does the outgoing mail server test during setup/configuration. Did an upgrade to the 5.108 alpha on this device, and a re-install on samsung android 5.x devices, encountering the same issue on all. The same K-9 works fine sending to gmail, with basically the same outgoing mail server settings (465 - ssl/tls).

		Dear k9 developers, I have found that AlarmManager.set(int type, long triggerAtMillis, PendingIntent operation) is used in com.fsck.k9.helper.K9AlarmManager#set(int,long,android.app.PendingIntent). According to Android API Guide Using this API on devices with SDK higher than 19, the alarm may not be sent at the exact scheduled time. You may refer to API guide for details. So I am suggesting if you can change the set method to setExact method, so that the alarm can be sent at the exact scheduled time. Thank you.

		It would be helpful, if the &quot;add to contacts&quot; function would not only pass the e-mail address, but also the real name to a new contact. Example: If there is an e-mail in the inbox from &quot;Dr. Susan Miller (Veterinarian)&quot; mail@susan-dogs-and-cats.com K9 mail right now only imports mail@susan-dogs-and-cats.com to a new contact. To add the real name to this new contact, you would have to go the complicated way of changing back to k9 mail, copying the real name (that meany opening the mail, &quot;show headers&quot;, copy the real name out of it), changing back to the new contact and add the real name. This would help a lot, thanks in advance! Spectas Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.008 Android version: 5.1.1 (Cyanogenmod 12.1) Account type: IMAP + CardDAV (DAVdroid)

The email itself is just a MIME attachment. I can download the file, but the only option available to open it is gmail. Yep, I have to open the attachment with gmail because I can't read it with K9Mail, which doesn't seem to register itself as a mail application with the system.

		Sometimes threads are listed more than once in the message list. This is because of a bug in the query to create the threaded message list in EmailProvider. Usually the latest message in a thread is displayed. But when multiple messages have the same timestamp all of them are displayed. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.108

		Expected behaviour The recipient box with the real name/email in it should be themed to be dark when the user has a dark theme enabled. Actual behaviour The background stays the same colour, but the text is themed to be lighter. This makes the background and foreground very similar, making the box hard to read.

		Expected behaviour K9 should sync my mail account every 5 minutes. Actual behaviour During the night and somtimes irregularly during day, my account isn't synced. Instead it tells me that Auto-Sync had been disabled. By googling I found advices to turn Auto-Sync on in Settings &gt; Data usage. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S6 and there this option has been removed. The only place where I can disable Auto-Sync ist in Settings &gt; Accounts. But this option is not disabled with me, and apart from that you only disable syncing the defined accounts in Android. But K9 is not an account. Furthermore, there is the setting that I can enable background sync independent of Anroid's Auto-Sync option. But this doesn't work. Even if I set this option to always, it tells me that Auto-Sync had been disabled and refuses to sync my Accounts.

		After the upgrade to K-9 Mail 5.010, it seems that the software is draining the battery of my Samsung S5 (Cyanogenmod Marshmallow) way more than before (old K-9 version unknown). In fact, K-9 mail is by a factor of &gt;4 largest consumer of battery power (next being Android OS). I have four accounts configured, 3x IMAP, 1x POP3 (hourly).

		Expected behaviour First, congrats for the brilliant App! I have multiple IMAP accounts. Often there is a need to move emails to folders in some other email account. This is a standard feature in Samsung's native email app, Apple's IOS email app, and all desktop email clients. Actual behaviour Your app does not allow me to Move emails to other accounts.

		Expected behaviour When folders are set to first class, they should stay that way. Actual behaviour K-9 Mail suddenly decides that folders that were previously explicitly marked 1st class no longer are. Steps to reproduce Set folder class and push class to first class and other settings to same as explicitly set settings. Wait. Eventually, at some random later point (sorry, can't be more specific because I don't actually know exactly what the trigger is), observe that the folder is no longer displayed when only first class folders are being displayed.

The behaviour: When I'm signing an email there is no problem, but if I get an answer from another person with my original signed text is quoted, k9mail only displays the signed part (my own email) and doesn't display the answer. What k9 schould behave: Display a line of text like ---start of signed part--- Signed text ---end of signed part--- Or to display a button which toggles between the original message and the only signed message.

		Expected behaviour I have two installs of K-9 Mail integrated with Openkeychain as the cryptography backend. On the first system I generated an initial PGP key using Openkeychain. This key was backed-up and imported onto the second system using Openkeychain. My problem is with controlling the Auto-sign and Auto-encrypt checkboxes located in Settings|Account|Cryptography. You should be able to toggle these checkboxes on and off with screen taps. Actual behaviour On both systems I cannot change the state of the Auto-sign and Auto-encrypt checkboxes. On the first system (on which the key was generated) the checkboxes are greyed-out and inactive (off). On the second system (on which the key was imported) the checkboxes are greyed-out and active (on). Steps to reproduce Install Openkeychain and K-9 Mail Generate an initial key on one Android device Import the key from step (2) onto another Android device Configure K-9 Mail on both devices to use Openkeychain and the key Observe the functioning of the checkboxes is broken In other respects signing and encryption work as expected Environment K-9 Mail version: v5.010 on both systems Android version: System #1: Android 5.0.2 (ASUS ZenPad 10 Z300C) System #2: Android 5.1.1 (Sony Xperia Z3 phone) Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP4 (Cyrus Imap 2.4 running on FreeBSD)

		I think a feature for setting a pin for opening the app would be really awesome so that when you lose your phone and someone manages to unlock it he can't directly view your e-mails and e-mail-account related data (e.g. the dropbox app has this feature).

		Hi! The first time i've used K-9 mail (long long time ago) i remember that i was puzzled, &quot;How can i reply to this?&quot;. Then I found the &quot;Send -&gt; Reply&quot; menu. I think that is not really good from the viewpoint of user experience. I think the most used feature is the reply menu, that should have it's own button on the toolbar, it should not be hidden under a context menu's second option. So it would be good to think about which features are the most commonly used, and to put them to a higher visibility / easier to be reached point. Like: i never moved any emails of mine (thunderbird's filters doing that). Previous / Next mail should be a swipe to left / right and then it would free up two buttons on the bottom toolbar. Reply, Reply all could go to the right top maybe? Show headers, copy, move, refile (I'm not even sure what it does) mark unread could go to somewhere a bit out of sight, but still with the most used features (show headers, move) on the top. So, i thought i share my ideas with you, thank you for k-9 mail!

		Hello! It would be good to have an easy to use feature that could add the email addresses in To, Cc, From, etc headers to the contacts list. It should search for an existing contact (to append the email for that), but give an option to make a new one with that address. Thanks:)

		Expected behaviour I use K9 in both my phone and tab. In phone, I am able to get more quick navigation buttons, e.g., Previous, Next, Delete, Spam, Reply, and Menu for other options. Surprisingly, I get less options in my tab which has actually got a bigger screen and a more empty space. See the picture for comparison. If I add say, Spam in Tab, the Reply feature completely disappears. Actual behaviour As per the attached picture, there should be an option to add at least two more quick buttons in Tab, e.g., I would like to have quick access to Spam and Move. Steps to reproduce Open the Inbox and check. See the attached picture. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: Lollipop Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Since updating to the 5.108 prerelease, I can no longer see the body of some multipart HTML emails. The header appears intact, and the messages appear fine in other mail clients. Plain text mail is fine, as are many HTML emails. I think the failing ones all have inline attachments (graphics) but I'm not 100% sure of that. When I turn on debugging and &quot;adb logcat&quot; I see the following exception appear each time I try to view a problematic HTML email. Devices: Google Nexus 5X, latest Marshmallow 6.0.1 Sony Tablet Z2, Marshmallow 6.0.1, February update. Perhaps unrelated, I did have to force k-9 to request the IMAP folder list after the update to see all of my folders besides just the INBOX, Trash, etc. I tried &quot;Clear local messages&quot; for my Inbox, but that did not change the behavior. I have not yet dared to try &quot;Clear messages&quot; or &quot;Recreate data&quot; on the account. 05-10 13:51:34.286 D/k9 ( 9362): MessageView displaying message MessageReference{accountUuid='9f5ff35a-c63f-4071-853b-9c8aec540551', folderName='INBOX', uid='319609', flag=null} 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): Unable to getTextFromPart 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): com.fsck.k9.mail.MessagingException: File not found 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.mailstore.FileBackedBody.getInputStream(FileBackedBody.java:32) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.mail.internet.MimeUtility.decodeBody(MimeUtility.java:1021) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.mail.internet.MessageExtractor.getTextFromPart(MessageExtractor.java:78) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.mailstore.LocalMessageExtractor.buildHtml(LocalMessageExtractor.java:153) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.mailstore.LocalMessageExtractor.extractTextAndAttachments(LocalMessageExtractor.java:117) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.mailstore.LocalMessageExtractor.decodeMessageForView(LocalMessageExtractor.java:442) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.ui.message.DecodeMessageLoader.loadInBackground(DecodeMessageLoader.java:46) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.ui.message.DecodeMessageLoader.loadInBackground(DecodeMessageLoader.java:15) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at android.content.AsyncTaskLoader.onLoadInBackground(AsyncTaskLoader.java:312) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at android.content.AsyncTaskLoader$LoadTask.doInBackground(AsyncTaskLoader.java:69) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at android.content.AsyncTaskLoader$LoadTask.doInBackground(AsyncTaskLoader.java:66) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at android.os.AsyncTask$2.call(AsyncTask.java:295) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:237) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1113) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:588) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:818) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.fsck.k9/files/9f5ff35a-c63f-4071-853b-9c8aec540551.db_att/3569: open failed: ENOENT (No such file or directory) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at libcore.io.IoBridge.open(IoBridge.java:452) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at java.io.FileInputStream.(FileInputStream.java:76) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at com.fsck.k9.mailstore.FileBackedBody.getInputStream(FileBackedBody.java:30) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): ... 15 more 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): Caused by: android.system.ErrnoException: open failed: ENOENT (No such file or directory) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at libcore.io.Posix.open(Native Method) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at libcore.io.BlockGuardOs.open(BlockGuardOs.java:186) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): at libcore.io.IoBridge.open(IoBridge.java:438) 05-10 13:51:34.362 E/k9 ( 9362): ... 17 more

		Expected behaviour SMTP helo handshake should succeed. In particular, when the current Android hostname is not a valid public ip address, some mechanism should be used to retrieve the public ip address the device is sending from.

		The current version of K9 (5.010) has several malfunctions/bugs in its notification function. Could you please have a look into this section of K9 and fix these bugs in a new version? Expected behavior With former versions of K9, it was possible, to delete any incoming mail directly from within its notification in the notification area, without opening K9 itself. This is managed by global settings &gt; notifications &gt; show ‚Äúdelete‚Äù button &gt; always. Actual behavior My new device is a Samsung Galaxy S7, running Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow). Here, independent of which setting I chose (‚Äúalways‚Äù or ‚Äúfor single message notification‚Äù), it is no longer possible to directly delete incoming single mails through their notification. Steps to reproduce After several tests, I found out that the malfunction depends on the K9 language settings in global settings &gt; display &gt; language. I put it together with several screenshots in the attached file. K9 notifications.docx If language of K9 is set to ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù (which is my country), there is no option for deleting mails from within their notifications. Additional bugs when using ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù language setting: most often, the notifications even disappear from the notification area within 1 or 2 seconds and I have no chance to get information on incoming mails. if more than 1 messages have arrived in the same account, tapping on the notification always takes me to the latest incoming message, instead of going to the list of unread messages account settings &gt; notifications &gt; notification opens unread messages (is active) If language of K9 is set to ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù, I will be allowed to delete incoming mails from within their notifications, single mails as well as multiple mails. Additional bug when using ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù language setting: if more than 1 messages have arrived in the same account, tapping on the notification always takes me to the latest incoming message, instead of going to the list of unread messages account settings &gt; notifications &gt; notification opens unread messages (is active) Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Device: Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)

		Hi, I have a catchall domain and I use one address per service, with some I need to reply to. So I configured a few identities in K9Mail. Let's say I have configured default-id@my.domain and id2@my.domain and id1 is the default. When I reply to a mail sent to id2@my.domain, k9mail selects default-id@my.domain as identity for the reply. I'd expect it to select id2@my.domain since mail was addressed to that email (visible in To/Cc sometimes, and always on X-Original-To in my setup). There are multiple headers which can define the original email it was adressed to, but K9 could maybe match a few headers against the identity list ? Priority would be X-Original-To / Delivered-To / X-Envelope-To / To / Cc I suppose. Not sure if there are more potential headers doing this job. Is it already done and I am missing something maybe ? If not, consider this a feature request ! ^^ Thanks ! Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 4.4.4 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behaviour Reordering e-mail accounts by moving an entry up or down in the list of all account. Actual behaviour An additonal entry in the list is created at the place where the account was assumed to be moved to. The very same account is also listed at its old place. Seems like both entries in the list refer to the same account because removing one also removes the other. Steps to reproduce got to account list choose &quot;move up&quot; or &quot;move down&quot; via popup menu 3.

		Expected behaviour When I moving account up it must move up. Not make a copy upper :) Actual behaviour I got a two copies of the same account. Was before move up: Account 1 Account 2 After I used &quot;move up&quot; on account 2, I got: Account 2 Account 1 Account 2 I tried to open Account 2 (first) and Account 2 (last) -- opened well. I fixed the case only by totally closing (in task manager) K-9 mail, and restart it. Steps to reproduce Setup two POP3 accounts. Try to move up Account 2.

		Expected behaviour Make an option &quot;Show CC/BCC&quot; field in options when you editing/composing new message. Currently there is only an option &quot;Request read confirmation&quot;. Add to menu &quot;Show CC/BCC&quot; fields. After taping on this, CC/BCC fields must be shown or hidden. Actual behaviour Option: &quot;Always show CC/BCC [ ]&quot; - is not enough. Because I have no any methods to see these fields if this option is disabled, but I'm composing a new message or replying on message without CC-field in source message. Steps to reproduce Just to create new message while &quot;Always show CC/BCC [ ]&quot; option is disabled. Try to see CC/BCC, if you will need.

		Expected behaviour I would expect to see the &quot;new mail&quot; dialogue. Actual behaviour The app crashes. Steps to reproduce start k-9 mail select new mail icon crash Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.109 Android version: Android 6.0 marshmallow, huawei style (EMUI) Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Thoughts on this: Could this result from a permission problem? K-9 requests access rights for &quot;contacts&quot; and &quot;storage&quot;, which are granted. Four additional permissions show up in a subfolder (read email attachments, read emails, delete emails, k-9 remote control). Everytime I manually grant those, the slider is back to &quot;off&quot; when I revisit this tab... Does k-9 fail in requesting those rights at installation time? logcat: generated as described in HOWTO: int logctl_get(): open '/dev/hwlog_switch' fail -1, 13. Permission denied

Note: log switch off, only log_main and log_events will have logs!

		Hi ! Apparently (at least on my LG G4 5.1 Lollipop with trebuchet as home app), the &quot;unread&quot; widget is always 1x2. It doesn't seem to need that much space (1x1 should be fine), and it's not possible to resize it. It would be nice to have a resizable one, or at least 1x1 widget provided. Cheers ! nodens

		Expected behaviour When I'm in portrait mode and on the message detail view, I expect to have reply, reply all or forward in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen. (I do get them under when I press the menu button, and Send...) Actual behaviour The toolbar disappears in portrait mode. (Note: Landscape mode is OK.) Steps to reproduce Be in portrait mode. Be in message detail view Let your eyes lazily meander north. Behold the space where there should be some buttons. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 4.3 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Note: My phone is rooted, and I have increased my screen resolution to 360 whatevers, using the app LCDDensity. When I reset the resolution to default, which is an unknown number of whatevers, the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons, and the Delete, Reply and Compose buttons all appear at the bottom. When I set it back to 360, the bottom toolbar disappears (so the Delete, Reply and Compose buttons disappear), but the Next, Previous and delete buttons then appear at the top of that screen. (Someone might reasonably say that if my changing the screen resolution fixes the issue, then that's what I should do. I still hope, though, that someone is planning a fix.) Thanks to everyone who's worked on K9. Cheers, Richard

		Expected behaviour I would like to have one option to auto decrypt mails with APG etc and save locally. (Reason: This should let me search locally all emails for some thing as we have every thing available decrypted.) This helps secure email during transport from email providers and I don't bother much about my phone and k9 mail client security. This will be a great convenience and should help many adopt this. Actual behaviour Finding to find an email using a text search thru all encrypted emails is difficult. manually going thru each mail decrypt and see is difficult and inconvenient If I dont bother much about saving unencrypted locally in the sense that K-9 will use a encrypted container for all the mails together but all emails are saved plain text in that container.

		Expected behaviour I decrypt email and should be able to decide if I want to keep it that way or save it decrypted locally. when I say save it locally, I mean k9 should show the message unencrypted and should be able to find this email by text search of the content of this email. Actual behaviour I decrypt an email then later time I open this email again I have to decrypt this email again. But I dont have an option to save it decrypted locally as this is not an email that needs to keep decrypted and only needs to reach me encrypted and now I dont need it encrypted anymore. The advantage is that I can search thru emails and can find this. If this is encrypted I will not be able to search the content to find this email.

		I've thought about this suggestion and whether it will be offensive to post it here rather than to fork, refactor and push it to f-droid myself. A quick online search revealed that I'm not alone with my thoughts. This e-mail client is fine, very fine, I love it. My respect to all contributors. But most likely it will never be accepted as a serious application. The reason is an ugly name and the the whole branding (icons). Do you really think that any serious company which is not a lemonade stand would like to see an ugly robo-dog icon on their main launcher? Most people don't even know what K9 means or stands for. How do you think about to rename the entire package into &quot;e-mail&quot; or &quot;eMail&quot; or something similar without any fancy names additions and a simple envelope icon? üëç 2 üëé 1 üòï 1

		Upgrading from K-9 Mail 5.008 to 5.010 breaks its Share functionality when attaching a file to an email under AlienDalvik (based on AOSP 4.1.2) in Jolla's SailfishOS 2.0.1.11 K-9 always crashes, a pop up window is displayed stating, &quot;Unfortunately the application com.fsck.k9 has stopped. [OK]&quot;. By clicking on [OK], K-9 restarts, and saves the message in the Drafts folder, but without the file being attached. I checked the following: Using the Share functionality between other applications works: I tested between Amaze, OpenKeychain, TurboEditor and a few native SailfishOS applications. Using the Share functionality in other Android applications in order to send a file to K-9 Mail always crashes K-9 in exactly the same way (as described above), no matter if K-9 was running or not. Sharing data (not a file) does not crash K-9 Mail, but seems to exhibit another bug: a handle (?) is inserted into the mail body, not the data sent, e.g. with data sent from BarcodeScanner: [Subject] Barcode Scanner - Plain text [Body] market://details?id=com.fsck.k9 I will file a separate bug report, when sufficiently tested to write up something more comprehensive. It also makes no difference, which Android application is picked, when using the Share functionality from within K-9 Mail for attaching a file to an email: K-9 always crashes. Tested with Amaze file manager and TurboEditor. Only when I pick SailfishOS' native Gallery application (which is the third application offered besides Amaze and TurboEditor when attaching a file in K-9 Mail on my Jolla Phone), K-9 does not crash and the file is indeed attached. But it is not Android's internal Share mechanism being used here, instead the still somewhat fragile Share functionality between Android and SailfishOS applications provided by Jolla's SailfishOS 2 is utilised. In this specific case (attaching a file to an email in K-9) it even works consistently stable, but unfortunately SailfishOS' native Gallery app allows to select picture file formats (e.g. jpg, png), only. After downgrading from K-9 Mail 5.010 to 5.008, the Share functionality works fine, again. I am sure willing to make further tests, checks and balances, when provided with instructions how to. Please do try to fix that, as the inability to attach arbitrary files to emails in K-9 Mail renders the beautiful and feature laden K-9 useless as a generic email client. Cheers and Kudos for maintaining and enhancing the best mobile email client I am aware of. And I am really looking forward to the progress on PGP/MIME. P.S.: I suspect the MIME handling changes introduced in K-9 Mail 5.009 to be the cause. From K-9's changelog on https://k9mail.github.io/k-9/changelog_5.0-MAINT_branch.xml: 5.010 [...] 5.009 [...] Improved MIME type handling when other apps share files to K-9 Mail [...]

Have it fail‚Ä¶ download it a few more times just in case it was corrupted; it still fails. Environment K-9 Mail version: I currently have v5.010 installed, via F-droid. Android version: 5.1.1 (Cyanogenmod 12.1-20151117-SNAPSHOT-YOG7DAO1KI-d802) FWIW I'm attempted to upgrade to use PGP/MIME support. The current issues are a bit vague, but there's some suggestion that it's been fixed. However, the more-recent release, 5.010 still doesn't support PGP/MIME. Does the alpha support it? Further, my current install of K-9 was via F-droid. Do I need to uninstall this version first? I'm worried that my email and settings will be deleted if I do so.

		this is more a feature request than an issue... would it be possible to auto complete new-email's TO/CC/BCC fields based on senders/receivers of already pulled and locally stored emails ? Indeed, I like K9 because it allows me to send/receive emails without requiring to be linked to my device's gmail account, thus saving part of my privacy. Also, my 'contacts' do contain only minimal infos about my friends (in case the device would be robbed and to protect their privacy against Google). In such a context, k9 does not provided any auto completion :(

		Hi! I have built K9 from source and it has been very easy since the source is very clean and well organised, thanks to you! Then I wanted to build libos-compat.so, but its source isn t in K9's, all there is in K9 is an already compiled version. I downloaded SafeContentResolver-0.1.0 and built it, but the resulting file is much bigger than the one you use in K9 (70 kb whereas yours is only 9 sommething kb). The file is built within the SafeContentResolver-v14.aar and that s probably why it s heavier, the README file says that v21 is much lighter. But, impossible to have it to build with v21... Or maybe your file is smaller because you used only part of it for K9, with the ABI options? The thing is that I searched and I searched and I could t find anywhere how to build that lib the K9 way. Would you mind sharing the way you did it? Thanks in advance!

		I always used K9 with my work IMAP account. Yesterday I upgraded my phone to Cyanogenmod 13, and K9 to the newest version. Now I get SSL errors when I try to connect to the server. It seems the same in the build in email app, however the &quot;Outlook&quot; email apps seems to work fine. I can get mail from the server fine with Thunderbird on Windows also. Sending seems to work ok. Other email accounts (for example gmail) work fine using IMAP.

		Android version: 6.01 Using K-9 Mail v5.010 (stable) i could send emails using my old WEBDAV account. But never delete emails on the server. Then Updated to K-9 Mail v5.109 (alpha) / and also to K-9 Mail v5.110 (alpha). Now I can delete emails on the server, but I can not send emails any more. They end up on the outgoing folder. Sorry I can't tell you the error message. The message text is too long so it's truncated... Then Downgraded (titanium Backup / also the database) and sending emails is working again.

		Expected behavior Sending and fetching mail possible when using mobile connection and when using Wi-Fi connection. Actual behavior Sending mail and fetching mail fails when using mobile connection - everything works when using Wi-Fi. K9 is the only app that does not work when using mobile connection. The failure happens all the time so it is not dependent on a particular time or place or on the SMTP server. Background sync is &quot;Never&quot; so I manually fetch the mails from a SMTP server. As soon as I switch on Wi-Fi sending and fetching works normally.

About the message list bottom bar, for instance (not in multi-selection mode), I don't care about the search or sort actions, but I do about the mark-all-read, mark-as-spam and delete actions, but K-9 mail doesn't allow customizing this. Same for the notification banners.

		Expected behavior Using open keychain with k9 on android, When opening an e-mail thread where I have signed and not encrypted but the replying party has not signed/ encrypted, the entire message thread should be displayed and arguably no confirmation successful decryption and valid signature. Actual behavior The most recent reply from other party is not shown and message regarding decryption is shown. The most recent contribution to the email thread is not signed and so I question whether decryption/key checking should be activated. The signature checking seems to cut off any message above the start of the most recent signing block. An email thread might look something like this: Unsigned reply signed reply enclosed in inline pgp block sent from desktop mail program unsigned reply to original mail signed message enclosed in inline pgp block sent from desktop mail program. What actually happens looks like this: x unsigned reply (not shown) Signed reply sent from desktop mail app. Pgp signing block not visible (parsed by k9/open keychain?) unsigned reply signed original message with pgp signature block. Additionally, if I reply all parts of the thread are visible in the quoted reply so the content is still there. Steps to reproduce Set up open keychain with k9 Send email to someone with inline signature block Get reply with no signature Reply with signature block Get another reply without signature Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 6.0.1 (Chroma ROM) / was also happening with 5.1.1 stock android.

		In the app I can move mail only in the same account between folders. I thought to add a feature for moving mail between different accounts. So my question is what are you thinking about it if it possible because i didn't saw it in any android mail app and it is exists in outlook and ios if you think i can make it what do you suggest me to study first for making this feature. Thanks in advance zafrir.

		If you long press on a message (in a folder's message list view) a pop-up will appear with options like spam, delete, etc. On older versions of Android the menu would have a reasonable size. In android N, the menu is usually tiny, requiring scrolling to find the option you want, but sometimes varies size e.g. after popping it up 5 times it might finally be a reasonable size! Expected behavior Message list long-press pop-up menu is reasonable size. Actual behavior Pop-up menu is vertically tiny so only 1 or 2 options can be seen at once (scrolling is luckily possible to access the others) Steps to reproduce Open any folder e.g. Inbox. Long press any message. Look at the size of the pop-up menu. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 7.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behavior Tell us what should happen The automatic account settings picks POP instead of IMAP for comcast.net accounts. Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead When creating a new account and letting k9 figure out the account settings, it picks POP even though IMAP is available. It should be picking IMAP since comcast.net supports IMAP. I'm not sure how k9 decides what to use. The best way is to probe a few combination of things to figure out if IMAP is supported and if it is, use IMAP otherwise try POP and fall back to POP if IMAP doesn't work. If it is already probing, it may be the way it probes that isn't working. Comcast uses the full email address as the login name not just the username so the probes might be failing by using the incorrect name. i.e. login names are user@comcast.net It is also possible that the server name for IMAP or SMTP is incorrect. Comcast uses imap.comcast.net and smtp.comcast.net for the server names. manual IMAP configuration works, but k9 should be smart enough to figure out the IMAP settings and use IMAP. Steps to reproduce create a new account for a comcast.net account. Once completed, account will be using POP instead of IMAP. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: Samsung S4 running Android 4.4.4 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): NA

		Expected behavior Every e-mal on the server should appear in the Inbox. Actual behavior At random, messages do not show up in the Inbox. I have been using K9 on my Fire tablet for maybe a year or more now; and, for the past several months, I have been using it to screen my e-mail, since Windows Mail takes so much resources and occasionally crashes. If I see something I want to reply to or click a link on, I go to WLM to open it. However, recently, I was sent a 911 from someone wondering why I hadn't replied. The reason: the e-mail didn't was never in my K9 Inbox, Trash, nor any other folder! Yesterday, I received a notice that my on-line work wouldn't start till Friday at 8 a.m. When I went in to start, I saw a message saying work had started Thursday at noon. I opened WLM, waited for it to download dozens of e-mails, searched for the company name, and a notice telling me I could start work at noon Thursday was there. I went back to the Fire, searched Inbox and Trash, and the message was not there. That makes K9 mail totally useless for me. I don't think this has always been the case; k9 mail has been working slower and slower since one of the past couple of updates, but not downloading mail that can be found by another e-mail client is totally unacceptable. Steps to reproduce Check mail. Discover one way or another that an e-mail was never received. Go to WLM and download e-mails to find it. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.000 Android version: Fire OS 5 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): POP3

		Expected behavior It should download new emails as it used to do. Actual behavior It downloads from some of the accounts that are set up, but then puts up a message saying &quot;Unfortunately, K-9 Mail has stopped.&quot; It doesn't do it 100% of the time, but most of it. Then it'll stop crashing for a short while and then start again. Steps to reproduce 1.Pull down emails to make it sync. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version:6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): K-9 is configured with 6 POP3 mail accounts all on the same server. It is my suspicion that I had received a badly crafted email on one of the accounts that gets a lot of SPAM. This started the problem. I would guess that it has now corrupted something in K-9 which is causing the ongoing problems. I have sent a report of the crash several times, including a couple just now, one of which has debugging turned on. Your advice would be most useful - unless it can be sorted fairly quickly, I will have to switch to a different email app which would be a shame after I've used K-9 for several years and recommended it to other people.

		Expected behavior SMTP connections should be properly closed when they are created in an unusable state. Actual behavior I found an issue during SMTP testing. When opening a connection, if authentication fails for some reason, we don't close the connection during clean-up. I think this is unlikely to cause an issue, but it's possible that when setting up and testing a connection we'll be creating lots of sockets and not closing them. I have a potential fix (and set of tests for this). Steps to reproduce Run an SMTP server that doesn't support the requested AUTH method. Get K-9 to connect to it. K-9 will send EHLO, get back lack of capability and not close the connection. See #1649 for a test environment Environment K-9 Mail version: master Android version: N/A Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): SMTP

		Hello, Expected behavior For me it would be very useful the application to have the possibility to store, for every account, an optional field (command line to execute before stablishing the connection towards the email server). This field would contain a command line which would be executed before trying to connect to the email server. In my case, this would be useful, because I am planning to use fwknop in the linux server where I will have the email server. The fwknop functionality gives you the possibility to close all ports of your server until the server receives an appropiate combination of tcp messages. In such a case, the fwknop server would create firewall rules to open the port requested for a few seconds. In these few seconds, the client can connect to the server because the ports are open. fwknop2 is an application available in Android as open source code. I suppose this fwknop2 application could be modified to have the possibility of being invoked to send the fwknop messages from the command line, and then, using the new feature just requested for k-9, open the ports before attemting to connect to the email server. Actual behavior ---------
 Steps to reproduce Environment K-9 Mail version: For new versions Android version: For all versions Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): For all account types P.D. I suppose you are very busy with other implementations. In this case, I could offer my services to try to program this request. Although I am not very familiar with Android, I have quite experience programming with Java and I think I could succeed with this development. Please, let me know what do you think about it. Kind regards, Fran. ( frojasg1@hotmail.com ) EDIT: Post formatting changes only (@philipwhiuk)

		If you have multiple accounts for K-9 and you get new email in them you should get one notification per account. What actually happens is that new emails are listed under the wrong notification. For example if I have account A and account B. I get an email from A A notification is created for A. This is correct. I get an email from B. A new notification is created for B. This is also correct. The notification for A is updated with the email from B turning it into a multi-line notification. This is incorrect. Seen on: K-9: master branch Android: Nougat (7.0) Nexus 6P

		Expected behavior With business email a key functionality is handling calendar invites you get from various organizations/people. Usually they come in form of mail attachments with .ics extension. So in effect this is tightly coupled to email and it deserves dedicated handling. Desired features: filter inbox by emails containing attachment with *.ics name (sometimes there is more than one attachments in one email, but if at least one of them is calendar invite that we want to highlight this email) preview of the invite displaying the basic details of the invite automatic parsing - auto-add to built-in calendar, or at least suggest auto-adding with one click confirmation Actual behavior Right now you have to manually open the attachments with *.ICS extension with default MIME handler which is build-in calendar app. This is time consuming and it easy to miss the invite. Another downside is that such manual opening of the attachment automatically adds the meeting to calendar which is problematic when you want to reject it or it is added at some distant date making it difficult to locate/identify. Steps to reproduce send to yourself calendar invites from: Android calendar iPhone/Apple calendar Microsoft Exchange calendar Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.1 Android version: 5 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP and POP3 üëç 2

I would love to be able to run this on my recently refurbished tablet too cause even with the Windows 10 &quot;tablet optimizations&quot; The older hardware starts to smoke every time I try to use a bulky client like outlook or Thunderbird and frankly there aren't any good lightweight email apps for these devices

		Expected behavior I should be able to see all folders and also use other e-mail clients to access my account. Actual behavior When I use the &quot;Show all folders&quot; action, I am being banned by my e-mail server due to &quot;too many connections&quot;. Steps to reproduce (I am writing this in a generalized way and I am putting specific circumstances in soft brackets. Access/Configure to an IMAP server (Microsoft Server (OWA) at workplace) with K9-Mail. Access/Configure to the same account with Thunderbird. Create some folders under main INBOX in Thunderbird. Change K9 settings to show &quot;All Folders&quot; instead of only 1st or 2nd class folders. Try to access e-mails via Thunderbird again and fail due to &quot;wrong password&quot;. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 5.1.1 CyanogenMod 12.1/LG G3 D855 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP on Exchange Server. Additional Info The Thunderbird error turns out to be insufficient. The error message &quot;wrong password&quot; is not true. Nothing has changed with my password. The problem turns out to be the maximum allowed connections! And the problem always starts with &quot;Show all folders&quot; in K9-Mail. By allowing more connections on the server side resolves the issue temporarily/shortly. I guess, K9-Mail invokes too many connections, presumably one for each folder, without closing these. On a mail server where this number of connections exceeds, other clients cannot access anymore. Same password, which used be working and still is working with K9-Mail and Webmail, stops working for other clients (Thunderbird in this case). But the problem isn't Thunderbird or the password. I think solution would be to tightly limit outgoing IMAP connections by default. I didn't find any option to this in the settings.

		There's a possibility to group messages into message chains and display them as a single entry in a list. When user taps on message chain input messages from selected group are shown. It would be more comfortable if sent messages were displayed too, allowing user to look over the whole conversation. Such behavior is already implemented in TypeApp - another Android mail client. Expected behavior After tap to message chain all emails with selected subject are displayed independent of folder they are placed to. Actual behavior After tap to message chain only inbox emails with selected subject are displayed.

		I would appreciate possibility to set displaying of &quot;show folder&quot; button as one of main buttons, visible for one-tap using. The same way, like it is in native android application. There is &quot;order by&quot; button instead of it in K9mail. I use K9 mail instead of native android mail app, because K9 can refresh (download, sync) all folders in account, and I use lot of folders (and filters, which are directing new messages into various sub-folders; and I need to read some sent or archived message sometimes). So, I need to switch view between various folders very often. And I absolutely do not use another ordering but a default newest top. So I would like to have button &quot;folders&quot;, as it is in default android app. I have not found such possibility in settings. K9mail is necessary for users with lot of folders, so more users could appreciate that button, I think. Thanks.

		hello, Currently using k9mail with APG on Android. The files attached to a mail are not encrypted; only the contents of the mail is encrypted. In other words, when attaching a file to a mail, and checking the 'encryption' check box, I would expect both the mail and its attachments to be encrypted. regards, Damien Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 5 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP APG v1.1.1

		I'd like to see k-9 accessing my Tutanota Accounts. (https://tutanota.com) They do not support IMAP nor POP3 because it would break their end-to-end encryption solution, but fortunately everything they do is Open Source. (https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/) You will find a short tutorial on their github page with the title &quot;Building and running your own Tutanota Android app&quot; which should be really helpful for you guys =)

		It would be nice if K9 mail could support this recent cipher for TLS (Edit: ChaCha20/Poly1305). See https://timtaubert.de/blog/2016/04/a-fast-constant-time-aead-for-tls/ for an explanation of what this is. The cipher is especially designed for mobile devices without AES hardware implementation and may therefore be especially good for smartphones.

		Expected behavior Inline PGP should be accepted correctly (or not at all). Actual behavior Inline PGP email is encrypted and signed with the same key-pair. This message will be marked with a red lock saying &quot;signature made by wrong key&quot;. Sending the same message with a current version of K9 and using PGP/MIME and using the same key-pair shows the message green. Steps to reproduce Use only 1 key pair. Send [encrypted and] signed email to self using the current stable version, which uses only inline PGP. Use the same key-pair with v5.114 (alpha). Send a message with the same key pair again. The new version marks the email send via Inline PGP (with the old version) as wrong, while only the one with MIME PGP is marked correctly.

		Went from Nexus 10 (Android 5.1.1 Build LMY49J) to NEXUS 9 (7.0.0 Build NRD91N, Nov 2016)) Both were routed so I used Titanium Backup and moved K-9 Mail v5.010. I have 3 mail acounts 2x IMAP and one WEB-DAV using exchange (with a self signed cert) The IMAP accounts are OK, but the WEBDAV account just reports Java exceptions. Can't fetch new mails, nor can't change something in the mailserver settings. Are there any known incompatibilities with Android 7 and webdav support? Also tried the latest v5.114 (alpha). isn't better at all. Setting up completely new gives the same result. So it's not caused by using Titanium Backup. Besides I know that this config is working on Android 5.1.1 BR Markus

		Hi all and thanks very much for this nice app I have a professionnal address link to a personnal adrdess. Basically the professionnal address forward the email to the personnal one. However to answer to the professionnal address I must go through a specific smtp which is different from the one of the personnal address. I have created an identity with the personnal account and an alias with the professionnal account. Is there a way to specify the smtp of the alias? Android version: 6.0.1 Account type IMAP:

		The context menu that is displayed after a long press on an email is sometimes too small. This happens because the menu is always limited in height based on where the email is. If the email is in the bottom of the screen, the menu is &quot;rolled&quot; upwards and fills all available space. If however the email is in the top part, the menu is also rolled upwards and displays only one single entry. It's more or less unusable this way. Ideally the menu would always fill the screen (or choose whether to roll up or down based on where the email is located) I'm using a Nexus 6P, with the latest release from the google playstore.

		When using one of my accounts, some messages (which heavily use html) are not correctly fetched. I can see the title and some headers but the body is missing. This happens only with one mail account. The cause is probably this exception: 11-14 07:55:17.157 23585 23602 E k9      : synchronizeMailbox

My device is a chinese Xiaomi Redmi 3S, which uses a special android version without google in general and google play services in particular which makes using some apps impossible (and installing google play services does not work). maybe it has something to do with that special android version?

		Expected behavior When an user on Windows encrypts an email with Thunderbird (newest version), Enigmail/GPG and sents it as Inline PGP, K9 Mail recognizes this mail as encrypted and opens the passphrase dialog of OpenKeychain to decrypt the message. Actual behavior K9Mail does not recognize that the mail is encrypted and simply shows the encrypted mail body. Possible reason It seems that additionalcharacters &quot;=20&quot; are added after the &quot;Version&quot; header which do not appear when using other PGP Clients. K9Mail does not seem to be able to ignore or detect this. I am not sure whether this is a protocol violation on the side of Enigmail or K9Mail. This is what the source code of the encrypted mail body look like: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Charset: utf-8
Version: GnuPG v2
=20

		Expected behavior If my smartphone is in doze, I should immediately receive notifications about incoming mails via IMAP and push connection with syncing enabled. Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead After some time I see the words &quot;syncing disabled&quot;, although it is &quot;always enabled&quot;. Steps to reproduce use imap with push, syncing enabled close all apps, put phone to doze send yourself an email you don't receive any notifications of incoming mails anymore I found out, that push syncing in doze mode seems to still work on my newest android 7.1 (cm14.1) if you set your auto email-request interval to say 30 minutes. This seems to keep the push connection open which is a good workaround until this gets fixed. Another thing I tried before is excluding k-9 mail from android battery optimizations, but this unfortunately didn't make a difference. Environment K-9 Mail version: v5.010 Android version: Andoid 7.1 on Samsung Galaxy S5 (SM-G900F) Cyanogenmod 14.1-20161201-NIGHTLY-klte Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP üëç 1

		Expected behavior Deleted items should delete and stay deleted; items saved to Drafts should show up in Drafts; e-mails should open immediately, delete immediately, and return to Inbox immediately. When I first got my Fire tablet, I recommended K9 to my cousin who has a Fire tablet, and she loved it. Today, I mentioned losing the K9 draft, and she said she started having trouble with K9 &quot;a long time ago&quot; and stopped using it. So it isn't just me nor my limited storage Fire. Actual behavior I have to delete items dozens of times to get them to stay deleted; they reappear as read in both the Inbox and the Trash folders. When I save an e-mail in progress to Drafts, it just disappears, and I have to start over. It has started taking longer and longer for K9 to respond to anything I try to do with it, often going to black screen, returning to the Folders menu because it got stuck doing whatever I tried to get it to do, showing only the top half of the accounts screen or Inbox screen, or message screen. Steps to reproduce Do anything on the Fire tablet. Do anything on the Fire tablet. Do anything on the Fire tablet. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.000 (upgrades don't seem to be available for Amazon Fire's K9) Android version: Fire OS 5.3.1.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP and POP3

		Expected behavior I am trying to access an outlook365 account (I have to because my work decided to outsource their IT infrastructure to the Microsoft Cloud) with K-9 via IMAP. The server settings are as follows: server: outlook.office365.com security: SSL/TLS port: 993 authentication: normal password auto detect IMAP namespace true IMAP path prefix I expect messages that I have marked as read to stay read and messages that I have stared to stay stared and messages whose star I have removed to remain &quot;unstared&quot; Actual behavior Unfortunately, when I do any of the above operations (mark read, star, unstar) then the message is displayed as read, stared, unstared for a while but during one next few hours (or sometimes just minutes), read messages come back as unread, and stars disappear or reappear. I also see the following errors for various sub-folders of the account in question: K9-Mail version: 5.200-RC2

 Here a similar problem was reported and a workaround could be to &quot;limit the number of connections&quot; as is discussed there. Would you at K-9 be willing to work on such a workaround? If not, is there anything else I could try to make outlook365 via IMAP work? Steps to reproduce Set up an outlook365 accoun Mark an unread message as read Wait for it to come back as unread Further background I have also tried to setup the account as an Exchange account together with the people from our IT without success. Sending email via SMTP works without problems.

		Expected behavior There must be an option to deactivate the progress notifications when fetching from an IMAP server. Actual behavior Progress notifications cannot be deactivated. Steps to reproduce Don't use push Update all IMAP folders every 20 minutes Get notifications every 20 minutes Environment K-9 Mail version: Latest trunk Android version: all Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Extended reason / Explanation I'm syncing my Phone notification to a watch. There are only 2 ways to filter the notifications to the watch. 1. In Android: Notification can be blocked per app. 2. In the watch-app that syncs the notifications to the watch. Also here I can only filter by application, but not by notification type. So there must be a way to disable specific notification types in K9 (like &quot;fetching new emails&quot;). Obviously, the notifications ABOUT NEW EMAILS of K9 are very important to be sent to the watch, so they should not be blocked. When using IMAP PUSH it is all good. But push has only limited support with some IMAP servers. So sometimes it is necessary to set the timer, to fetch IMAP messages every 20 minutes. Problem : That causes the smart watch to ring and vibrate every 20 minutes several times (for each IMAP folder) with a new notification (&quot;updating folder XXX&quot;).

		Expected behavior HTML mail should pinch zoom as it always has Actual behavior In 5.201 I tried zooming a few HTML emails. Nether would pinch zoom (though double tapping made them a tiny bit bigger). At least once this led to a crash of the app. I reverted to 5.010 and zoom works just fine with the same mail - in fact, it never had any such issue so I'm not upgrading until this is fixed. Steps to reproduce Open html email e.g. from Xbox.com Pinch zoom Either nothing happens, it moves a tiny bit, or it ends up crashing. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.201 is broken for this.

		Expected behavior Tell us what should happen Issue 1: I suppose K9 should automatically decrypt all incoming emails once Openkeychain has been turned on in settings and private key is provided. Decryption works fine if I copy/paste the encrypted text into Openkeychain. Issue 2: After encryption PGP raw data should come in the body of email, not as an attachment. Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead Issue 1: K9 does not automatically decrypt incoming emails, I only see raw pgp data + there is an icon in K9 saying email is not encrypted. Issue 2: When I encrypt emails with K9+Openkeychain, the recipient receives a blank email with two attachments named 'Unknown Name', with my encrypted message inside. Steps to reproduce Issue 1: Install latest K9 Install latest Openkeychain and import my private key + other people's public keys In K9 settings select Openkeychain as pgp provider and also my private key Asked my friend to email me, got encrypted email but K9 did not automatically decrypt it. Issue 2: 1 and 3. same as above 4. Created a new email, selected the recipient from my contacts, the lock turned green indicating there is a public key for this recipient. I taped send, it asked me to enter my password and this is it Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.201 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): irrelevant, the issue is the same with any account

		Expected behavior Size of account message data storage should decrease with deletion of messages in account folders. Actual behavior Prior to recent update to v. 5.201, size of account data storage was approx. 200kb with all messages deleted. Since update, data storage amount changes only a few KB when all new messages are deleted from inbox and trash folder. Data storage amount now showing over 700kb and rising with every new incoming message that is read and deleted. Compacting the folder has no effect or only reduces amount by 20-30kb. Steps to reproduce Account data storage amount at 272kb. New 100kb (example amount) message arrives in inbox. New message read, deleted from inbox, and deleted from Trash folder. Account data storage amount now at 360kb (example amount). Compacting folder does not reduce data storage amount. Notification message indicates amount reduced from 360kb to 360kb.

		Expected behavior When you create, forward or reply to a message the recipient's name or email address should show. If there are more than one recipient their names or email addresses should show too, separated by commas. Actual behavior When you create, forward or reply to a message the recipient's photo shows next to their name or email address. If they do not have a picture in your contacts list or are not in your contacts list a large initial (the first initial of their email address or name) appears next to their email address or name. This takes up a huge amount of space, especially when you have a drop down list. There is no option in the settings to turn this behavior off and just show plain text, comma separated with no pictures/initial and no dropdown list. Steps to reproduce Go to an email account. Create a new message. Start typing in a name or email address in the To: field. When you are finished with that recipient you will see their picture or a giant initial.

		Expected behavior In the email list view there is a star icon which appears to be supposed to be clickable.

		Expected behavior Open PGP encrypted message in inbox, get prompted for PGP passphrase and enter it, then see the decrypted message text. This is also the actual behavior up to and including 5.010. Actual behavior Open PGP encrypted message in inbox, get prompted for PGP passphrase and enter it, but the text displayed remains the PGP ASCII armor, i.e. the data starting with &quot;-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----&quot; and ending with &quot;-----END PGP MESSAGE-----&quot;. No cleartext message is displayed. Steps to reproduce This seems to be related to the encoding of the incoming PGP message. The messages who cause the issue are MIME messages with two parts: one is the ASCII armor with content type text/plain. The second part is also the ASCII armor, but with some additional HTML markup and content type text/html. I've attached the full SMTP message, stripped from most headers, for your reference. As you can see from the headers, the user agent of the sender is Thunderbird. I've also attached the k9 debug log. message.txt k9-log.txt Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.201 Android version: 4.4.4 (CM 11-20141115-SNAPSHOT-M12-i9100) Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behavior Compose new message. Select a recipient whose public PGP key I have. Enter message subject and body. Tap the lock symbol right to the sender (i.e. my) name. Change setting from &quot;Encrypt if possible&quot; to &quot;Encrypt&quot;. Continue. Send message. Message is sent. Actual behavior Message CANNOT be sent. Popup shows the following text (translated from German): &quot;No signing key is configured. Verify settings.&quot; Steps to reproduce I use a PGP environment with separate subkeys for signing and encryption. On mobile devices, I only have the encryption subkey, but not the signing subkey and also not the master key. Hence, I can decrypt only, but not sign. That's exactly what I want. If your interested in the full rationale, German computer magazine c't has an in depth article about it in issue 27/2015. It seems that starting with k-9 5.200, I can only sign and encrypt, but not encrypt only. This seems like a regression from 5.010 and earlier. In those versions, there were two separate checkboxes &quot;Sign&quot; and &quot;Encrypt&quot; in the compose new message dialog, so the &quot;encrypt only&quot; use case worked perfectly. Here's my debug log, in case it helps: k9-log-2.txt Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.201 (also 5.200) Android version: 4.4.4 (CM 11-20141115-SNAPSHOT-M12-i9100) Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP üëç 1

		After the update to 5.2 many people have connection problems, most likely because their mailservers only support weak ciphers that are no longer supported. Some others report problems with Google which can't be weak ciphers. I would appreciate a note that states clearly why the connection fails and maybe even encourages the user to go to the mailserver provider and fix the problem at the rooot.

Actual behavior I noticed after upgrading to 5.201 on FDroid that cryptography stopped working. Going into the account settings it said &quot;No OpenPGP provider found.&quot; After uninstalling the app, and reinstalling 5.100 and 5.201 separately (from FDroid), the latter does not ask for a permission to read keys from APG, which is likely why it doesn't detect it.

		I first noticed this on my wifes klte with CM12 - for some reason (unexplicable to mee), the unread widget has the size 2x2 instead of 1x1 for at least a year now (uninstall and reinstall of k9 didn't help). Now, since I updated to K9 5.2, it also happened on my klte with CM13.0, but the size is now 1x2 (as you can see in the attached screenshot). The widget is not resizable after added to a homescreen. Expected behavior The widget should always be 1x1 in size, as it was before. Actual behavior On some devices, the size is off - 1x2 or 2x2 on two of my devices. Steps to reproduce Can't reproduce - can get rid of, either, by uninstalling/reinstalling. Also did a wipe of K9 data once on my wifes phone, to no avail.

		Ever since updating to 5.201 (or 5.200; all was fine on 5.200-RC anyhow) there's a problem fetching email. It constantly downloads data, takes ages and then says &quot;SSL exception:write error&quot; under the inbox. I just installed 5.202 but it seems the problem is still there.

		Previously was able to connect to mail.talktalk.net incoming server using SSL/TLS, 993, Normal p/w (as per provider's recommended settings). After recent K9 updates, connection to incoming server is only possible using None, 143, Encrypted p/w. Outgoing server smtp.talktalk.net still connects fine using STARTTLS/587/signin/Normal p/w, as before. I have asked the provider to confirm what protocols/ciphers they are supporting. Expected behavior Should be able to configure incoming server settings SSL/TLS, 993, Normal p/w, verify, and then connect to retrieve emails Actual behavior Verification of incoming server settings fails with all configurations except None, 143, Encrypted p/w. Error 'SSLProtocolException: SSL h' results if verification is ignored (ie 'continue' instead of 'edit'. Steps to reproduce enter incoming server config set any settings (except None, 143, Encrypted p/w) save - config will fail. if continue instead; attempting to sync emails results in SSLProtocolException: SSL h Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.202 Android version: 5.1.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP (talktalk.net)

		In 5.201, scrolling up and down the folder list is often slow and jerky. Scrolling up and down the message list is quite smooth, now that I disabled getting names from contacts; it‚Äôs only the folder list that‚Äôs problematic. In versions before 5.200, this only used to happen if I was downloading messages at the same time, while it was smooth if I wasn‚Äôt doing anything. In 5.201, on the same device and same server, it‚Äôs bad even if I‚Äôm not doing anything.

		Expected behaviour When tapping on a message in the list, the message will take full screen and there are icons at the bottom of the screen for left, right, delete, reply, new, and menu. Actual behaviour These icons are not consistently displayed. When they are not displayed, it is still possible to tap the empty space where they should be and the icon function will happen (for example, tap where the delete icon should be and the message will be deleted). Sometimes only the right-most fragment of the icon bar is displayed. I tried to get a screen-shot of this, but as soon as the screen-shot was triggered, the entire icon bar displayed correctly just in time. So it seems that Android's screen-shot function triggers a redraw first, and screenshots cannot therefore be used to capture examples of insufficient-redraw artefacts. Steps to reproduce Send yourself a blank message, or one with very little content Refresh the message list so your new message appears Open the message Sometimes the icons are displayed OK anyway. This is an intermittent problem. You may have to send yourself 4 or 5 messages and open each one to reproduce the issue.

		Expected behavior A mail icon (an envelope inside of a circle) should appear on the Moto Display lock screen when new mail arrives. It has done this for the years I've been using K-9 Mail. Actual behavior There is no lock screen notification since updating to K-9 Mail 5.201 and it still doesn't work in 5.202. It is now necessary to unlock the screen to see whether there is new e-mail. The K-9 Mail lock screen notifications began to malfunction after updating to 5.201. When new mail arrived, the Moto Display lock screen would show an empty circle instead of a mail envelope inside of a circle. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling K-9 Mail, and now there is no Moto Display notification at all when new mail arrives (the Android visual and audio notifications still work, but it is necessary to unlock the screen to see the Android notifications). ALL other Android apps (e.g., Calender, SMS, Voice Mail, Missed Call, etc.) display their respective notification icons on the Moto Display lock screen, so this issue is definitely related to one of the last two K-9 Mail updates and not a problem with my phone. Exact same issue on both of our Republic Wireless Moto X 1st Gen phones. Only affects K-9 Mail notifications. Steps to reproduce Lock phone screen (with Moto Display enabled) Send an e-mail message to a K-9 Mail configured account from another device When the new mail arrives on the problem device, notice there is no lock screen notification icon Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.202 Android version: 5.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Phone version: Republic Wireless Moto X 1st Gen

		I have a number of folders in gmail account, both 'actual' (done e.g. via a MUA like Thunderbird) and 'virtual' (aka labels) defined by filters, thus created on the fly by gmail. Such are 'custom' folders/labels, beside the 'system' ones. My gmail UI lang is Italian, if that matters k9 seems to duplicate both system and custom folders as &quot;[imap]/label&quot; Expected behavior no new folders/labels should appear, and e.g. 'trash can' should move email in gmail's 'trash', 'send' should copy in gmail's 'sent' 'save as draft' should save in gmail's 'drafts' etc rather than create new folders Actual behavior k9 seems to duplicate both system and custom folders as &quot;[imap]/label&quot;, e.g. in browser gmail view I get, after using k9: [Imap]/Bozze [Imap]/Cestino [Imap]/Posta inviata [Imap]/Sent [Imap]/Trash beside (below) the 'original' ones, e.g. these 'system' folders: Posta inviata [= 'sent'] Bozze (67) [= 'drafts'] Cestino [= 'trash'] Steps to reproduce just use it - send, receive, trash etc emails Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.201 Android version: 5.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): gmail

		Expected behavior All new messages should be displayed in my inbox Actual behavior A single &quot;bad message&quot; arrived in my inbox on my personal IMAP server (dovecot) and was not displayed by K9. All messages recevied after this bad message were also not displayed. Going into another email client and deleting the &quot;bad message&quot; cause all other new messages (received after the &quot;bad message&quot; to now be displayed correctly. In my folder list, the string &quot;NullPointerException: attem&quot; is displayed in whichever folder contains this &quot;bad message&quot;. Steps to reproduce I have attached the &quot;bad message&quot; to this issue as a .eml attachment renamed to .txt. I've had a quick look at the headers and can't see any obvious cause for a NullPointerException. The only changes I've made is to replace my personal email address with xxxxxxxx's. 2.If you can find a way to get the attached message into a folder on your IMAP server, I expect you will see the same bug I have experienced. !!!

		Following latest update, pinch to zoom no longer works as expected Expected behavior Should behave as you'd expect in any typical android - any pinch gesture zooming in and out as expected Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead Pinch to zoom only seems to work when doing a horizontal pinch - if your fingers aren't aligned left to right relative to the screen then it won't zoom. Also, once zoomed, can't scroll back to the top of the email Steps to reproduce Open email Try pinching to zoom Environment K-9 Mail version: Android version: Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange):

		When I want to send an encrypted email I have to input the recipient email address exactly the way it is written in the identity of the public key. K9 Mail/OpenKeychain shouln't treat different casing as different keys. Example: Have a key in OpenKeychain with upper and lower case characters. Input recipient in K9 Mail without upper case characters: Mail wouldn't be encrypted. Enter recipients address exactly as it is in the identity within the public key: Email would be encrypted. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.202 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP but probably not relevant

		Expected behaviour Synchronisation should work flawlessly. Actual behaviour K-9 seems to process every email in my INBOX from time to time (maybe when the IMAP IDLE connection was lost? At least it does when going out of airplane mode in the morning, or after killing the app), and is rather slow at it. I would say around 15 emails processed per second. And I have thousands of them in my INBOX (I know, that‚Äôs bad), which results in several minutes for the whole things. Also, this is blocking email retrieval for all accounts while doing this scan. Sorry if duplicate issue, didn‚Äôt found one with this. Could be related to #2061/#2069 though. Steps to reproduce Have a very large INBOX. Reboot, kill K-9 mail, whatever makes its connection lost. See K-9 starting to spin, and after sometime starting to slowly increase yyy in ‚ÄúR√©cup. :Inbox yyy/xxxx‚Äù where yyy is the number of already processed messages and xxxx the number of total messages.

		Expected behavior Before 5.201, i was able to resize the email body for better readability, with the usual two finger gesture. Actual behavior Since 5.201, Double tap (still) resizes email body, to a &quot;fit in display&quot; level, leading to unreadable small font size. No chance to resize, gesture ignored. Some sort of workaround is to go back to folder level an reopen email. But even then very often font size is too small.

		Expected behavior there is a setting under &quot;sending mail&quot; for each account's configuration called &quot;Always show CC/BCC&quot; this checkbox setting can be toggled on or off marking this box as checked would give the impression -- quite unambiguously, one would think -- that the CC and BCC fields are always to be shown beneath the TO field when composing a new message. Actual behavior when composing a new message, if the checkbox is marked in the settings, the CC and BCC fields do indeed appear /at first/ beneath the TO field of the new message, however the moment someone begins trying to type in the Subject or Body of the message, these fields collapse away if they are not populated with any data or entries. &quot;always show&quot; should mean what it says... ALWAYS show. Steps to reproduce under Account Settings, go to Sending Mail settings mark the checkbox for &quot;Always show CC/BCC&quot; compose a new mail message the TO, CC, and BCC fields will all be present tap anywhere in the subject or body area of the new message that you are composing CC and BCC fields collapse away, in direct defiance of what you wanted tap small down arrow, to cause the CC and BCC fields to appear again tap anywhere else pull your hair out as the CC and BCC fields AGAIN disappear with seemingly no way to make them permanently remain visible.

Actual behavior Results vary by email provider. Some email providers have no problems while other major ones such as Google worked initially and some mail but then subsequently stopped receiving new messages and have not downloaded anything since even though new messages have been sent to effected accounts.

		Running K9 5.203 from Google Play. Google Pixel with Android 7.1.1. I Have three accounts on K9, all are accounts on gmail but with non @gmail.com domains. Call them: trevor@a.com (personal, gmail with custom domain) trevor@b.com (corporate with google apps) trevor@c.com (another business, not used in this example) Bug #1: Open trevor@a.com on K9. Send email to self (trevor@a.com). Email never appears as &quot;new&quot; mail in either K9 or gmail web UI. Appears in &quot;sent mail&quot; only. This used to work on versions of K9 up until recently, suspect broken around 5.2? Bug #2: Open trevor@a.com on K9. Send email to self but different account (trevor@b.com). This email appears as &quot;new&quot; mail IN BOTH ACCOUNTS. It shows as Sent Mail in trevor@a.com but new mail in Inbox of both trevor@a.com and trevor@b.com.

		Please search to check for an existing issue. I have, and found #1999 and #1743, but neither seem to exactly address what I want, I'm not sure whether #2087 addresses this particular issue, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Expected behavior I want the ability to separately sign and encrypt emails. I like being able to encrypt by default (kuddos you guys for finally supporting opportunistic encryption with OpenKeyChain and PGP/MIME!), but I would like to disable signing by default, even if encrypted. Being able to encrypt without signing supports confidentiality with plausible deniability, which I think is an important mode of communication. Actual behavior At the moment, it seems that one can Send unencrypted and unsigned emails Send unencrypted and signed emails Send encrypted and signed emails The option to send encrypted but unsigned emails is missing. Steps to reproduce Enable auto encryptions for known keys Send an email for a known key No option to not sign the message (except by disabling crypto entirely) Any encrypted message is sent with a signature.

		I have searched for existing issues, some relate to identities (e.g. #1117 or #935), but they are not addressing my problem/need. Expected behavior I would like to be able to use K9 the way I use Outlook user agent on my PC (and then be able to finally get rid off it!): in the from field, write any email address I want and have the mail sent with this address as &quot;From:&quot;. Actual behavior When I use a K9 identity, the smtp server of my mail host (one.com) rejects the mail (error 554 5.7.1), but again, it works when I use Outlook. Why? I had a look in the headers of a successfully sent message (from Outlook UA): the From is what I typed, but the Sender is my regular email account with which I authenticate on the SMTP server. I am pretty fine with this. I would suspect K9 maybe puts my 'From' address in the 'Sender' header as well, which would cause the error, or maybe does not set it at all (I tried to see the headers of a rejected email (from K9), I haven't seen the Sender tag, but it had not been sent, so...), which would be treated the same way. I have also spotted something strange: in the rejected email's headers, the message-ID was built with the domain of the From address, not the one of my actual SMTP account ('Sender'), maybe is it also a possible cause. Why all this? I own my domains, and I have set up specific sub-domains for emails. I can put anything before the '@', and I will get emails sent to it (kind of catch-all, but with rules behind). That way, I don't have to actually 'create' aliases (cumbersome), I can provide an arbitrary one any time, and it will work (most of the time, name/company/website@...). I can therefore spot when one of these addresses is misused and create a rule to trash all mails received through it if needed. However, this solution does not allow me to 'send' mails, except with the Outlook UA. I haven't found an Android UA capable of this (and I have tested a lot of them). I would just love if K9 was able to do it, either by default, or as an extra option in the identity settings. Please confirm how K9 handles the identities: as long as there is no SMTP settings per identity (I am personally not interested in this feature), it would seem logical to me that the Sender header (and message-ID) derive from the SMTP account being used to authenticate, not from the From header coming from the identity From email address, wouldn't it?

		On the TO, CC, and BCC entry lines, one expects recipients addresses to be editable. Also, one expects recipients addresses to be copy-cut-and-pasteable between the TO, CC, and BCC entry lines. This is broken in recent versions. Eg.: Enter abd@m.n into any of TO CC or BCC Now, try to 'correct' abd@m.n into abcd@m.n This does not work (anymore). It used to work in earlier versions. Reply to all of an email, formerly addressed to you, and at least also to ab@c.de Now, try to cut ab@c.de from the TO recipients entry line and paste it into the BCC (or CC) entry line. This does not work (anymore). Instead the copy action produces a lower quote character. It used to work in earlier versions. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: several Account type: IMAP Currently, with this loss of edibility of addresses, recipients management is awkwardly complicated.

		Expected behavior A user correctly sets up an email account in K9. User changes their password on the email system K9 is connecting to. User has not updated the password set in the K9 account settings. When an authentication failure occurs due to password, notify the user that the password is incorrect and provide them with a dialog to update the password in K9 account settings. Don't continually try to authenticate with the server thus potentially triggering account lockouts due to multiple authentication failures in a short span of time. Actual behavior When an authentication failure occurs due to password, no prompt or error is displayed for the user. Continually attempts to authenticate with server and in our system triggers the account lockout. Steps to reproduce 1.Setup an email account in K9 2.Change password in email system 3.Refresh inbox in K9 4.Observe no errors or prompts about incorrect password being displayed 5.Monitor audit log of mail system for authentication failures and lockout Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP k9-log-extract.txt

		At random times, to which I can't figure out when, K-9 Mail will show Syncing Disabled under my Inbox and notifications will not show up. Expected behavior Notifications should arrive when mail arrives. Inbox should not be showing &quot;syncing disabled&quot; Actual behavior Under the inbox you will see 'syncing disabled&quot; and during this time no notifications will show up. A pull to refresh in the window will grab new email but it goes back to syncing disabled. All regular settings to allow syncing and intervals are set up correctly where this should be working. Steps to reproduce Possibly not using the app for hours. Do not know the cause. Notice on another device (desktop client) that new mail arrived. Check K-9 Mail (the inbox) and see syncing is disabled Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: 7.0 (Nexus 6) Account type: IMAP

		Hi, Prior to 5.2 it was possible for the &quot;sign outgoing message&quot; to be selected by default on all new messages in an account. Please can this feature be restored? Expected behavior All outgoing messages are either encrypted if a key exists or signed if no key exists Actual behavior The 'enable PGP sign only' menu option must be selected for each message and reply Steps to reproduce Compose new email in a K-9 instance with open keychain installed and a valid private key set up Verify that there is no ability to automatically sign the message Select 'enable PGP sign only' from the menu Send the message Compose a new message The 'sign only' options must be selected again.

		Expected behavior &quot;Clear local messages&quot; should clear the locally stored messages, allowing one to re-download the messages from the server. Actual behavior Freeze. Steps to reproduce Have a folder with some large amount of messages. A few hundred should suffice. Make sure it's NOT up-to-date with the server Clear its local messages.

		Expected behavior Email should be fetched.

		Expected behavior There should be some way to edit the recipient email address short of deleting and retyping the entire thing. Actual behavior There is no obvious touch or sequence of touches to make the address editable. The delete button on the softkeyboard is active but deletes the entire address (and in any case there is no way to move point to the position where deletion or insertion is required). Steps to reproduce Reply to a message from an RT queue. Try to figure out how to append or remove &quot;-comment&quot; from the local-part of the queue's address. Get frustrated and give up on responding to that ticket in K-9. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Hello, The size of my account mailboxes is not decreasing when I delete messages. I have tried clearing local messages and compacting account but the size of the mailbox does not decrease, they keep getting larger. Removing and re-adding email accounts does not make a difference. Before recent K-9 Mail updates, clearing local messages in each folder after deleting messages and emptying trash would reduce the size of the account mailbox to around 100KB or less. There is a thread in the general purpose mailing list that began in early January. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/k-9-mail/OEpBHFCtxBo Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: 5.0.2 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): POP 3 and IMAP Your help will be appreciated.

		√ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√Ç¬¢√ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√Ç¬§ I already spotted another issue that might be related. but i want to make thinks clear, because I do not realy understand the issue on #1663 Expected behavior i expect to see the same question marks in the preview like i can see them in the e-mail it self. Actual behavior the mail preview has not the same characters as i see them in the e-mail itself. all questionmarks from the e-mail content are shown in the preview a crossed rectangle. √ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√Ç¬¢√ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√ÇÔøΩ√ÉÔøΩ√Ç¬§ Steps to reproduce i tried i manually, but it seams that it might be a github specific problem. so. i just hope that it is reproducable for me, after posting this issue here on github. i just have signed to all notifications in k-9. i let you know if it is the same. so i posted the line with the wrong encoded output directly at the beginning.

		Either in the encryption options or otherwise, we should add a 'whistleblowing' option. I consider this a 'slider preference' option. This would configure the app to do the following: Request the OpenPGP application to create a key - this may result in an activity for basic details but would automate as much as possible Encrypt the email with the key associated with that email address Not save the e-mail to Sent Items Delete the OpenPGP key once it's been used. The signing key would only be created and available during the send process. The aim here is to Support a mid level of plausible deniability. We're not interested in security services here (for that, #2139) more the corporate case. Help retain the link between signing and trust Remove the corner case where people request encryption without signing.

		Expected behavior I have currently an account on Fastmail (user@example.com) which allows subdomain addressing (whateveryoulike@user.example.com is automatically forwarded to user@example.com). Being able to create many emails on the fly is very useful to track how our email is used by companies (for instance I am giving whateveryoulike@user.example.com to the company whateveryoulike). The same thing can also be achieved through &quot;Plus Adressing&quot; (user+whateveryoulike@example.com). However on K9mail, we have to manually create identities before being able to use them as sender's email (while composing a new email or while replying to). It would be nice to have a new feature to handle that automatically. For instance if I received an email addressed to whateveryoulike@user.example.com, if I click Reply, the sender's address can be populate with whateveryoulike@user.example.com as well instead. Actual behavior if I received an email addressed to whateveryoulike@user.example.com, if I click Reply, the sender's address is filled with the default identity. Steps to reproduce 1.Send an email whateveryoulike@user.example.com 2.Email is automatically forwarded to user@example.com 3.Reply to the email within K9 4. Sender's address is the default identity user@example.com instead of whateveryoulike@user.example.com Environment K-9 Mail version: v5.203 Android version: 6.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Occasionally (without obvious reason or method to reproduce), tapping on DELETE and deleting messages from the notification area results in the message being deleted but the notification does not refresh or remove from the notification area (leaving it in place and still responsive to processing by further tapping). The only way to remove it from notification is to swipe it away to clear it. This happens frequently but not always. (Ive noticed a frequency with Facebook notifications but I would think thats coincidence rather than cause). This behaviour did not occur prior to 5.202. Expected behavior Tap DELETE within notifications, confirm delete (and have the message removed within the app), and the notification is updated accordingly (the messages no longer appear in the notification area). Actual behavior The notification remains and doesnt refresh to reflect the deletion thats been applied. Steps to reproduce This screenshot shows the initial notification of 2x new messages (although in reality there are 5 - but thats another problem and already logged). This screen shots shows me actually clicking and confirming DELETE of the 2 messages from the notification 'delete' button: This next shot shows that in the notifications there are the same messages still there (note the time of 7:59 is after I performed the delete for them - they have not been removed from notification area): If I tap on the notification to view the messages you see that they are not actually there resulting in : And the summary list view of the Inbox indeed shows that they are no longer there (but show the other 3 that should have also been included in the notification - again this relates to the other problem already logged).

		Some keys in global_preferences.xml are CamelCase and others are lowercase. We should unify them to lowercase to make it clear that there is no connection to the actual keys inside the preference storage layer.

		Expected behavior Have two unread messages in your account: one in IMAP folder 'INBOX', one in IMAP folder 'Spam'. Open k-9 &quot;Accounts&quot; page, and click on the &quot;Unread&quot; count (solid blue circle) of that account to open the &quot;Unread messages&quot; view. A list of all unread messages (two, in my case) is displayed. Click the Android menu button, and select &quot;Mark all as read&quot;. Both unread messages should be marked as read, and hence disappear from this list. Actual behavior Only the message from 'INBOX' is marked as read and disappears. The message in 'Spam' remains unread and hence stays in the list. Only when I select the check box to the left of the unread message in 'Spam', and then use the &quot;Mark as read&quot; button in the icon bar at the bottom, it works as expected. Steps to reproduce See &quot;Expected behavior&quot;. It should be noted that this problem only occurs when the unread message is anywhere else than in the INBOX folder. When it's in INBOX, everything works fine. If it's in &quot;Spam&quot;, &quot;Mark all as read&quot; doesn't work.

		When tapping items in Unified Inbox list, an aleatory item is selected (probably mixed item indexing issue). This works correctly in individual accound inbox list. And worked correctly in the previous releases. Expected behavior In &quot;Unified Inbox&quot; list, when you tap in a list item/message, the item should be selected and message opened. When tap in the checkbox, the related item should be &quot;checked&quot;. Actual behavior When tapping a list item, it is selecting an aleatory item, not the tapped one. Sometimes selects the previous or the next item of the tapped one. Steps to reproduce Open the &quot;Unified Inbox&quot; list (that aggregates more than one account, with mixed message dates).

		The newest version of K9 refuses to send messages with an empty subject unless you click send a second time. There does not appear to be an option to disable this obnoxious behavior. While some people may desire this warning, it was never present in the past, and if CKETTI refuses to add a setting for this because there are &quot;too many&quot; settings already, how did he decide that the people who want this warning should get it, over the people who never wanted it? This is absolutely something that should be an OPTION. What is a &quot;feature&quot; for some people is an annoyance sufficient to make others stop using it.

		In most of our screens, the k9 icon in the top left is a &quot;back&quot; button. This is not the case in the Compose dialog, but it would be nice if it was :) The particular action depends on the back stack: If the action was called from the message list, just return there. Otherwise, open up the K9 start screen. This can happen e.g. if the compose dialog is opened from some other app. (@cketti sanity check please, I'm not entirely sure this is in line with android behavior guidelines? if it is, this can be a beginner issue)

		Expected behavior When composing email, in the To:, CC:, and BCC: fields, typing in a contact's nickname should reveal contact(s) with matching nickname(s). Actual behavior Typing in a contact's nickname reveals no matches. Steps to reproduce Create a contact with a nickname In k-9 email, compose a new email In any of the address lines type the contact's nickname Note that there are no matches This is kinda important to me because I don't remember/know most of the real names of my Burning Man contacts, only their Playa (nick) names. (volunteer manager so have 150+ of them) So every time I go to send them email, I have to go to my contacts app, look it up there and then send email. PITA. There are also other social groups where this is common. (furries, for example) Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: 7.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Hi, I am using Lint to detect warnings that can cause expected results in k-9. And I found the following warnings that are interesting: 'setProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(boolean)' is deprecated Warnings are reported on line 148 in ChooseFolder.java in and line 1484 in MessageList.java. This API has been no longer supported since API 21 and deprecated in API 24 (doc). ProgressDialog may be used as a replacement. 'android.text.format.Time' is deprecated The warning is reported on line 978 in K9.java This class has been deprecated since API level 22. Several issues of this class like not thread-safe are specified in the documentation It is better to use GregorianCalendar instead. Result of File.delete() is ignored on line 140 in BinaryTempFileBody.java It is possible that File.delete() fails due to unexpected reasons. Ignoring the return value will keep the file always there and consumes additional disc space. These are the interesting Lint warnings I have found. Hope this can help. :)

		There should be a toggle switch to use k-9 through orbot. When disable my cellular connection and setup the manual proxy settings of my wifi connection to localhost and port 8118, k-9 still refuses to connect through orbot. This feature would make k-9 a much better choice for secure email connections that use .onion server addresses such as riseup.net.

		RFC 2920 - SMTP Pipelining Many email servers (e.g. gmail, Live) etc support SMTP command pipelining. This allows for optimisation of SMTP network traffic Expected behaviour We should change the behaviour of sendMessageTo to use pipelining to reduce round-trip-delay when we receive the PIPELINING extension. Actual behaviour Regardless of PIPELINING extension status we always wait for each response Developer notes The hard part here will be implementing SMTP command handle for asynchronous responses. Likely a queue of outstanding responses will need to be maintained. There's ample opportunity for testing here - the SmtpTransportTest code allows you to provide dummy responses from an SMTP Server. There should be tests written for: Using pipelining when it is enabled Ensuring pipelining is not tried when it is not enabled Ensuring that we wait for all responses to pipelined operations before considering the message sent Ensuring that we handle failures to one or more pipelined operations properly (and still read the remaining pipeline responses) The RFC contains examples for much of these: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2920 Steps to reproduce Enable verbose logging Send an email to Gmail or another server that supports PIPELINING Analyse the traffic

			<description>
		The error messages we get back from SMTP are often hard for a user to interpret and analyse. Gmail (potentially other providers too) supports RFC 2034 which provides enhanced status codes (defined in RFC 1893) K-9 should detect this extension and better parse the error messages it gets as a result. This issue can just be about handling the extension codes and better managing the structured data we send back to the front-end in an exception. Making better use of that data is a separate issue (likely in concert with the Design Overhaul). In all likelyhood this probably means converting: 535-5.7.1 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at 535 5.7.1 http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=14257 hx9sm5317360pbc.68 new SmtpFailureException(
      ResponseType.PermanentFailure,
      SubResponseType.SecurityOrPolicy, 
      Outcome.DeliveryNotAuthorized,
      &quot;Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=14257 hx9sm5317360pbc.68&quot;)
 The outcome of this individual issue will be the user seeing the proper message: Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=14257 hx9sm5317360pbc.68 Then a future issue can use the ResponseType structured data to display better notifications. It should be fairly easy to test this given the existing test harness set up for SmtpTransport

		Expected behavior I have a lot of folders in a nested structure. I would like K9 to support this structure in such A way that I can dive into child folders or go back to parent folders without looking at the entire folder list. this makes searching a lot more usefull. Also prevents a lot of elipses in the list of folders. For example: INBOX SUBJECT 1 -- SUBSUBJECT 1 --- Even lower 1 --- Even lower 2 -- SUBSUBJECT 2 SUBJECT 2 Actual behavior Currently when you look at the list of folders you get a long list of folders where the entire path is combined to a long string. INBOX SUBJECT 1 SUBJECT 1/SUBSUBJECT 1 ...1/SUBSUBJECT 1/Even Lower 1 ...1/SUBSUBJECT 1/Even Lower 2 ...1/SUBSUBJECT 1/Even Lower 3 SUBJECT 1/SUBJECT 2 SUBJECT 2 Steps to reproduce Open a IMAP mailbox with a lot of folders and subfolders Environment K-9 Mail version: K-9 Mail v5.205 Android version: 6.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP/Exchange

		It is a very common feature in many applications that when a user taps back button to exit, a Toast comes up with a message similar to &quot;Please tap back again to exit&quot;. It is a feature request and I don't see a downside on adding this to the k9mail. Instead if the user tapped the back button by mistake, the user will have a second chance to really exit the application. Expected behavior When user taps back button to exit from application a Toast comes up with a message &quot;Please tap back again to exit&quot; Actual behavior When user taps the back button the from Messages page (and other pages which will exit the application), the application exits.

		Hi I use email sharing (passing content to othr apps) with other apps alot but one issue I have is that it shares the whole body of email and if the whole body is a long email then it is a mess given that it also shares the html code. For instance I share an email to my tasks apps to keep track of it and in most cases the title and the date of email etc is enough information for such tasks. And given that most apps wont be able to render html inside the whole email body looks like a mess in the apps. My feature request is for having one more share item where it says &quot;share basic&quot; and the other would be &quot;share all/advanced&quot; this way the user can decide what kind of email content he wants to share with other apps. Or the other solution would be some kind of settings that dictaces how much info should be passed to the other apps. One solution would be to not to send any html and makse sure only rendered text passed along, if none of the ideas above is implementable. thanks

		While navigating from the Folders activity to the Accounts activity, if we use the button provided on the top-left corner to navigate through the folders activity to accounts activity it will work as expected. But here's the catch. It won't navigate to the accounts activity on tapping the back button of your smartphone. It will kill the application. The back button unexpected behavior happens only when tapping it first before going to Accounts activity. Detailed steps to reproduce this are given below. Expected behavior On tapping back button for first time also it should navigate to the Accounts activity. Actual behavior On tapping back button of your smartphone before using the on screen button provided in the application, it will close the application. Steps to reproduce Launch the application and goto folders page. Tap the back button of your smartphone and it will close the application. Now relaunch the application and again follow the step-1 and this time instead press the back button provided on the top-left corner of the screen(Left side of Folders) to goto Accounts activity. Now click on the account and get back to Inbox activity. Now again follow step 1-2. This time on tapping the back button of your smartphone you will be redirected to the Accounts activity instead of closing the application. Now you can tap back button or click on provided button any number of times from Folders activity, it won't kill the application. Now close the application and relaunch again and tapping back button will close the application again. But if you follow steps 1-3-4 first then this won't happen.

		Expected behavior: The hint text information should be readable in case of both mName and mDescription editTexts in landscape and portrait mode, too. Actual behavior: In portrait mode, some character of the hint text cannot be shown in case of both mName and mDescription editTexts because it is too long. Solution idea: In case of mName, the hint text would be Give the account a name... and the text which is in the brackets (optional) would be the text of a TextView right below the mName EditText. The mDescription EditText would be implemented according to the same logic.

		Hello. Is there way to upload all messages from K9-Mail 5.203 back to new empty IMAP server? I lost my IMAP server managed by Dovecot and now left only one copy of all my email ‚Äî K9-Mail. I checked flag not to delete local message deleted on server. I create new folder called BACKUP. And tried to copy(move tried too) message from Inbox to BACKUP folder, but K9-Mail doesn't upload it to server as I expected it. I'm very want to restore all this messages on server. Thanks. p.s. I had some idea to write X_REMOTE_COPY_STARTED flag to ALL messages in my .db and restart K9-Mail (I have root on my phone), but I see that 4 messages in my DB already has this flag but they weren't uploaded to server.

		Actual behavior When login with Gmail account I got this error message username or password incorrect (command: *sensitive*; response: #3# [No,[ALERT],Please login via web browser: http://support.google.com/mail/accounts/answer/78754(Failure)]) which is not a very useful message. after searching on google I found the solution is to https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and enable access for less secure apps. Expected behavior I should log into Gmail without much trouble, I know this might take a lot of time; so I propose at least in the mean time to show the user more meaningful name with the link to this page. as it's not convenient for first time user to search the web for a solution. Steps to reproduce Login with Gmail account with lesssecureapps turned off. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.205 Android version:6.0, 7.0, 7.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): Gmail

		Expected behavior When deleting an Email either from list or from inside an Email there should be a popup saying are you sure you want to Delete the Email ?? Asking Delete or Cancle to User will reduce chances of Accidental Deletion of Email. Actual behavior When we are deleting an Email its not asking for Confirmation and its deleting it directly. Steps to reproduce 1.Need to check why ConfirmationDialogFragment is not being shown while deleting. 2. Fix the issue that is causing it as its not even shown while moving to Spam.

		Expected behavior 1.While searching for a query to find an Email if we are not getting any results then we should show user that No Results found with this query and at the same we should provide them an option to edit the query and re-search for mail. 2.Suppose a user accidently put a wrong spelling then they should have an option to edit the query in the same page and Re-Search. Actual behavior While search if we are not getting any result then we are showing an Empty Page and user only have an option of going back and then selecting Search option again to search for a query with correct Spelling or so. It involves 3 Steps for Re-Searching - Go back to mail list . Select Search Again Type Query and Search This can be reduced to a single step - Just edit query and Re-Search on Same Fragment. Steps to reproduce 1.We Should give Edit text in the Top of Search Fragment to Edit Query or Re-Search if No Results Found. 2.We should show to user via a Png or just text that No Results found for your Query &quot;TestQuery&quot;.

		Hello, If I have K9mail check for new messages every 60 mins, it comes back every 60 mins saying 100 unread messages. I would have thought the expected/desired behaviour is to say 1 new message (since last sync) or don't notify if 0 new messages since last sync. Is this an option that I'm not seeing in K9 or is it not a feature?

		THIS IS THE SAME AS #2120 (for v5.203) but that is closed and I dont know how to append/reopen. This now applies to v5.206. I confirm that the problem now resides on 5.206 despite supposed fix being 'applied' in 5.204. &quot;Save As Draft&quot; offering is inconsistent. Expected behavior When browsing, for example the GALLERY on the device, and choosing a picture to 'share' through K9, a new email is generated with the photo attachment. If the 'return'/back out button is pressed on the device, K9 prompts &quot;Save as Draft or Discard&quot; (allowing saving as draft). Actual behavior If a fresh email is composed from WITHIN K9, and the 'return'/back out button is pressed, the email is unceremoniously discarded and no option to Save As Draft is offered. Steps to reproduce As above Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.206 Android version: 4.2.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange):

		Are they going to fix this issue that I see many others are having? K9 was just updated today and I hoped the fix was in, but no, left the phone alone for about an hour and upon waking up k9 said next sync 2 hours AGO, tried a little later and the old syncing disabled was back. I have tried everything, from whitelisting K9 from power savings to completely turning off that feature, no luck. I have tried MacroDroid to do things such as keep awake, turn wifi on and off, terminate the k9 process and after a delay open k9, and others all on a repeating 30 minute schedule, it still goes to sleep and k9 says syncing disabled, close and reopen k9 and it works fine. This started with Android 6.01 and got much much worse in 7.0 Thanks

		i dont see why it is nessesary to include the local ip address of my device into an unencrypted mail header that goes around the world while being monitored by all its *** players, its more an security risc then anything good. Think of the dalec who could kill my sweet robot dog just because its (or hes i am not quite sure) sending its exact locations in all messages ;)...

		Keeping in view of the interests of the end-users,it would be great to work upon simple tools that would enhance email experience. Like inclusion of a link scanner to scan for potentially harmful links. Another tool will be scanning for malware within archives using signature matching.A string search algorithm may be used to match keywords in mails for unwanted mails (and ask for a permission) before they are opened by end-user. These are simple tools but will be of great help for a better client experience. We may take help from open source antivirus engines such as Clamav to accomplish our task. Expected behaviour Decrease in online frauds. Decrease in mail bombing like activities and associated attacks by hackers. Better user experience.

		Hi, I think k9 is failing to reject expired (self-signed) SSL certificates, and/or the warnings have not been clear enough. I noticed this when I installed claws-mail on my laptop: At first I didn't believe what I was seeing, as mbsync (an IMAP synchroniser I am using) was not complaining, but then I went to the server: $ openssl x509 -text -in dovecotcert.pem -noout
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: XXX
    Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=XXX, ST=XXX, L=XXX, O=XXX, OU=IMAP server, CN=XXX/emailAddress=XXX
        Validity
            Not Before: Dec 27 00:42:30 2014 GMT
            Not After : Dec 26 00:42:30 2016 GMT
...
 It has indeed expired! (so we have a side issue for mbsync here too, I'll be raising a bug) I don't recall ever seeing K9 warn me that the certificate has expired. I've just deleted the account from K9 and re-added it. This is what I see: There's a subtle issue here. I expect to see a warning about the certificate being invalid due to it being self signed. People self sign all the time, and it's generally OK as long as you check the fingerprint matches. However, if the certificate is expired, that's another arguably more severe matter. I wonder if K9 should make a distinction. A question I can't yet answer is: what happens if the user initially sets up an IMAP account, accepts a self-signed but current (unexpired) SSL cert, then later the cert expires. This must have happened to me at some point, yet I don't recall K9 warning me (that's not to say it didn't but perhaps it wasn't explicit enough)? Does it just accept a cert forever more? Expected behavior When making an account: Explicitly warn the user if the signer is invalid. Give a separate explicit error message if the certificate has expired. If the user dismisses the warning that the cert is expired, warn again later (say once a day)? Maybe too extreme? After setting up an account: Warn explicitly when a previously accepted certificate expires (sorry if it turns out K9 does do this, but I missed the warning. Arguably, if I missed it, it wasn't clear enough) Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.206 Android version:66.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP The server side is dovecot. Thanks

		So I use K9 Mail because it is seamless for my Squirrlmail corporate email and my personal GMAIL. I had issues beginning last night as I got a message that my Authentication failed. I could not log back in, and deleted/reinstalled the app this morning. It still took several hours to connect, even though my laptop (windows 10 utilizing Outlook 2010 as the client) had no issues. After FINALLY getting my phone to connect, it once again stopped connecting and I get this upon a sync &quot;ErrnoException: open failed. I use the app a lot because I am on the go quite often, and I am thinking I may have to go to another app for my Corporate email?

		Currently when I'm offline (ie. in flight mode) and write an email, there is an non-userfriendly message (&quot;Failed to send some Message&quot; following GaiException: android_getaddrinfo failed‚Ä¶). Additionally the mobile LED will blink nervously in read. As there are various good reasons to be offline (often explicitely known anyway by the user) it would be more useful to show a note like &quot;Hey, I can't reach the server at the moment but it will be send when you are online again.&quot;. I mean, beaing offline isn't an error. That's one reason the outbox is for. And k9 mail is a native client that could handle it gracefully anyway. PS: I love the recent design changes üëç

		K9 is unable to connect to my smtp server: Server runs postfix with an SSL cert from letsencrypt Connection is made over SSL with plain text password via submission port Settings are fine, other MUAs can connect and send mail Imap works, with the same settings (ssl, plaintext password) All I can gather from the log is that the problem is SSL-related, but nothing more that would help k9-log.txt K-9 Mail version: 5.206 Android version: 7.0

		Expected behavior When sending an email with RTL languages (Hebrew, Arabic, etc), the dir and text-align HTML attributes should be &quot;right&quot; in the content's element. Actual behavior There is no dir and text-align HTML attributes in the content's element, and the text aligned by the email client default settings. In the composing editor the text appears fine, from right to left, but only on the composer level, and not in the HTML level. Composing is working as expected in RTL languages: But when reading content display is wrong: Steps to reproduce Compose new email with RTL language content. Send the email. Open the email in any other email client, that the default text alignment and direction is left.

		I'd like to propose an improvement for the settings screen inside Settings&gt;Account Settings&gt;Cryptography Expected behavior &quot;My key&quot; should show the name and email on the chosen key Actual behavior &quot;My key&quot; only shows &quot;Key has been selected&quot; Steps to reproduce This is a problem when you happen to have more than one private key. Create two email accounts Create two PGP keys, one for each Choose the appropriate key for each account It's far too easy to misclick and choose the wrong key, and there is no way to check which key was chosen. This is simultaneously: a technical issue(the email will be signed by the wrong key), a privacy issue(allows the recipient to connect purposefully isolated identities and get to know more email addresses of the sender), a UX issue(you only get the information on which key was chosen when encrypting the email, and if you chose wrong, it is very confusing). A patch would include querying Open Keychain to reveal the identity connected with the chosen key(unless K9 already stores that information) and putting the result of this query into &quot;My key&quot;. If doesn't have to be 100% of the identity, just enough to make different identities distinct, as in &quot;last 4 digits of the credit card&quot; Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.206 Android version: Used: 5.1.1, but probably all are affected.

		My setting for &quot;Lock Screen Notifications&quot; used to be &quot;Same as when screen unlocked&quot;. Expected behavior Show a notification presenting sender, subjects, and content of incoming mails. The notification should be the SAMe independent if screen is A) locked or B) unlocked. Actual behavior Depending on the current state (locked vs. unlocked), the notification is different. In addition, it remains unchanged if unlocking the locked device or vice versa. A) locked: &quot;Content hidden&quot; B) unlocked: preview of the actual e-Mail. Case A) is unexpected. In addition, if A) happened (content hidden) and the screen is unlocked, a newly incoming mail leads to a change of the notification presenting a preview of the content. Locking the device will then show &quot;XXX new messages. Steps to reproduce Lock screen Receive e-Mail (notification: &quot;content hidden&quot;) Unlock -&gt; notification still &quot;content hidden&quot; Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.207 (Fdroid) Android version: Lineageos 14.1-20170413 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Maybe you have heard of a messenger called Detla Chat. It does chat over the e-mail infrastructure. I.e. it's like a mail client, but in the form of a messenger application. Lots of people already use it, and it will probably become more and more popular once more features are implemented (like encryption). Now the problem is the following: Detla Chat gives me a notification if I received a message form specific senders (white list). This is the desired behavior. However, at the same time I also get a notification from k-9 mail. My request is to add an option to blacklist specific senders so that we don't get a new mail notification for them. That's it. Would be really cool if you could implement this.

			<description>
		Dear developers, We are applying our performance diagnosis tool PerfProbe to debug the delay for mailbox refreshing in K9 mail app and observe that sometimes the refreshing time increases by 4~5 seconds (on average around 2 second to refresh in my setup). Through its system-wide profiling and tracing, PerfProbe discovers that the source of extra delay results from longer execution time in com/android/org/conscrypt/NativeCrypto.SSL_read API calls (for example, one invoked by com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/ImapFolder.open -&gt; com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/ImapConnection.open -&gt; com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/ImapConnection.authenticate -&gt; com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/ImapConnection.saslAuthPlain), possibly caused by longer waiting time for server-side responses. We validate the root cause by enabling the debug messages in K9 and find that an existing IMAP connection seems to be disconnected occasionally, which results in this extra delay for setting up a new connection with the IMAP server during mailbox refreshing (mainly contributed in the authentication phase). We hope the findings from our tool can be helpful for your debugging. We are also interested in helping improving the performance of this interaction. To maintain the responsiveness of mailbox refreshing, we are wondering if there is any way to keep the IMAP connection persistent for a long time, which may help maintain consistent responsiveness for mailbox refreshing. Thank you very much for your attention and clarification!

		Hi, I would really appreciate a button to delete the message in the notifications. There already is 'mark es read' and 'answer', but the most common use cases are: Answer later from PC (which is fine by swyping the notification) delete the message (eg spam or irrelevant) archive (mark as read and move to specific folder) for emergencies or short messages: answer (now). Maybe it would fit best to make it configurable which actions are shown? Would love it!! Thanks so much for all the good work anyway!

		One of the minor issues I have noticed with K9 mail is how when you sync the unified inbox it syncs each email account one at a time. It would be nice to do parallel folder sync similar to how Outlook does things. Many modern android devices have multi-threading support and this should be possible to achieve

			<description>
		[Running Android 7.0 on a stock unrooted Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (SM-G935F) with K-9 Mail Version 5.206] I've been using this app for a couple of years without any issues to run a total of 7 email accounts (six G Suite, one gmail and one Outlook, one hotmail, all IMAP). In the past couple of days my primary G Suite account has been failing with the notification &quot;Authentication failed for xxx@xxx.xxx. Update your server settings&quot;. When I click on the notification I go through the K-9 password and server settings reconfirmation but the problem recurs after a few minutes. However, some email does appear to be getting through, so this is an intermittent error. I've checked and reset the email account password in G Suite and confirmed that I can collect emails via www.gmail.com and on other Android/Windows platforms. The password is correct and the account settings mirror exactly those in the other G Suite accounts, which are behaving correctly. I've also removed the account, rebooted the phone and re-added the account and received the same error. I've also Gone into www.gmail.com and signed out of all other web sessions. The G Suite settings are enabled for less secure apps. Oh, and I ran teh Recreate Data option in K-9.

		Expected behavior When a user receives an email from K9, they shouldn't see the list of bcc recipients Actual behavior The list of bcc recipients is actually visible Steps to reproduce IMPORTANT: The reproducibility of this bug depends on which email provider you're using. I reproduced it when using K9 with an icloud.com email sending a message to yahoo.com recipients. Add an icloud.com account to K9 Send a message to yahoo.com recipients (one TO recipient, a CC recipient and a couple of BCC recipients) When checking the message in the TO recipient mailbox, the list of BCC recipients is visible Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.109 Android version: 7.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP I think this happens because SmtpTransport.sendMessage receives a LocalMessage as a parameter. When the method set the BCC recipients to null, the actual BCC header is not removed because the setRecipients method of LocalMessage doesn't update the headers (as opposed to MimeMessage)

Unlike the &quot;past next poll issue #1141&quot;, which can temporarily be pseudofixed by closing and re-opening the app, this language-mix-thing is persistent.

			<description>
		In K9 mail, folders can be assigned the following classes: &quot;None&quot; (the default), &quot;1st&quot; and &quot;2nd&quot;. It is then possible to configure whether something (e.g. polling) applies to &quot;All&quot; &quot;Only 1st Class folders&quot; &quot;1st and 2nd Class folders&quot; &quot;All except 2nd CLass folders&quot; &quot;None&quot; Here, the last choice means not to poll any folders. This nomenclature is more confusing than necessary, since &quot;None&quot; has two meaning: &quot;no folders&quot; and &quot;no class assigned&quot;. A user could easily think that choosing &quot;None&quot; for polling means to poll the folders whose class is &quot;None&quot;. This problem could be resolved easily by renaming the &quot;None&quot; class to the &quot;Default&quot; class. This would be only an UI text modification that does not change at all how the application behaves.

		In &quot;account settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;fetching mail&quot; there is an option &quot;Poll folders&quot;. It can take values like &quot;1st and 2nd Class folders&quot; but it is not at all clear to which class this applies. I suppose it must be the &quot;sync class&quot;, but this is not obvious from the UI, nor from the documentation.

		It would be useful if the &quot;Failed to send some messages&quot; notification had a &quot;try again&quot; button. In virtually all cases the cause for this notification to appear is a flaky internet connection. It is the quite cumbersome to first tap the notification, which takes one to the account screen, then choose &quot;send messages&quot; from the overflow menu. Alternatively one could think of a option to make k9 try at least a given number of times with some delay to send messages and only then show the notification.

		Hi there. I have this one feature that would make the app experience feel more personal and customizable: the ability to customize the overall colors of the app (i.e. make the app have a more material dark theme by setting a HTML/RUB color code that is specially used for material). Would highly appreciate if this was added, Thanks!

		I've been using MailListWidget for K-9 on my S3 for years, but it won't work on newer devices. The other widget (Email Widget) listed on the web site does only work to a certain degree. I'm not an Android/Java developer so I can't write this myself, but a Maillist Widget should be fairly easy to develop. Why not make it part of K-9? MailListWidget for K-9 was slick and tremendously useful. I hoped something similar could be part of K-9.

		I use a mail service that encrypts incoming plaintext mail with my public key. Since this service doesn't sign the mail, I get an annoying &quot;security warning&quot; message saying that the email was encrypted but not signed, which I have to manually dismiss. This is bad UI design-- I would much prefer an indicator in the corner that warns against this. Alternatively, an option could be added to disable showing this warning. üëç 1

		I updated some weeks ago to a new phone with android nougat (7.0). I 've read up that syncing is not working properly on 7.0 and till a fix is found I can deal with doing manual upgrades. But I am experiencing another bug. I have 6 email accounts added (imported from a phone with android 6.0). First one on the list works as expected. For the rest if I press on them (A), K-9 closes. Long pressing shows the pop up menu but has Activate (2nd screenshot). Pressing Activate closes K-9. If I press on the directory icon on the right (B) on one of the not working emails, it enters in the Folders menu and I can access all directories, settings and sync the account just fine. So firing up K-9 only the 1st account on the top works normally. The rest if I press on them crash K-9 and only work fine if I enter in the Folders menu. Expected behavior It should be able to enter in the accounts without a force-close Actual behavior K-9 closes. Steps to reproduce Open K-9 Click on any account except the first. K-9 closes Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.207 Android version: 7.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): imap

		Enhancement Request: Full(er) Rich Text Editing Expected behavior I would love to have a more full-featured Rich-Text editor, ala the paid version of K-@ Mail (which is of course based on K-9, my go to generally). Actual behavior I can't do much formatting beyond basic text formatting. No lists, headings, blockquote, tables or other such. Steps to reproduce Use the editor and try and cut and past a list or similar. It doesn't hold the formatting. Interestingly the app shows text formatted and sent quite well, just not in the editing section.

			<description>
		I recently changed my mail setup to have K9 fetch mail from Dovecot IMAP server using a Maildir mail storage which is synchronized across multiple computers. Since then, each mail downloaded by K9 becomes flagged as &quot;seen&quot; and this changes Mutt handling of it. This issue is to request a way to configure K9 so to request NOT to flag the mail as &quot;such&quot;. Note: this is not read/unread flag but something different (mutt renders these mails as &quot;O&quot; for &quot;old&quot;, which means they are still unread but &quot;shown&quot; before [from+subject]).

		Hi, When reading a mail, it happens (accidentally or not) that the phone is rotated. Ideally, the current reading position within the text should not change when changing from portrait to landscape mode or vice versa. For example, when while reading the 10th paragraph the phone is rotated, this paragraph should still be displayed after the rotation. Unfortunately, K9 mail jumps all the way back to the top when the screen is rotated (and the display mode is changed from portrait to landscape or vice versa). This behaviour is rather annoying because one needs to scroll down again to continue reading. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.208

		Expected behavior I am using S/MIME to sign e-mails on my computer. When I open sent mails in k9 mail app on my smartphone the mail body is shown correctly, I can read the sent message, because it is just signed. I also see the attachment (signature file&quot; smime.p7s&quot;) there. Actual behavior Since last update the S/MIME signed mails are shown correctly in AutoPreview (I see text there), but after clicking on them to open the mail and read the full message. Instead a message &quot;this mail is encrypted / This e-mail is with OpenPGP encrypted. To read it you need compatible OpenPGP-App installed and configured / Choose OpenPGPG app&quot; appeaers and I have no chance to read the message. Steps to reproduce use a s/mime to sign e-mails from your computer open the sent mail on your smartphone with k9 mail app then this message appears Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.300 (installed 11th Sept. 2017) Android version: 7.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behavior It would be nice if there were some easy way to see folders that have unread messages. Possibly a new option in &quot;folders to display&quot; to show only folders with unread messages, or an option to sort the folder list so that the folders with unread mail appear above other folders. Actual behavior With hundreds of folders and unread mail in only a few, it's hard to quickly see where there's unread mail. (I think there's a way to see all unread messages, but I'd rather see folders first so I can decide which to look at.)

		I would like to request a feature to cleanly interrupt all syncing so that it then can be started cleanly again. I am using manual synchronization a lot and it often happens that sync gets stuck when the internet connection gets interrupted - for example in a train. Restarting sync at the moment has a lot of strange side effects like endlessly spinning or multiple sync notifications. &quot;Killing&quot; K9 through the list all running apps menu does not always solve these problems.

			<description>
		Previously, when multiple new emails arrived for a single account, those emails were grouped in to a single notification (1x swipe down) which on a single press could be all deleted (ie, DELETE ALL). Now, a group requires expanding (the 2nd swipe down), and when the group is expanded, each email is shown individually and each one then needs expanding (the 3rd swipe down) to get the DELETE button. However, after doing a delete of an individual email and confirming YES to delete, the notifications need to be opened again (with 3x swipe downs) to then delete the next email in the list. Imagine doing this if you have multiple emails - it takes ages! 8 emails = 24 swipe downs. (This is very possible for accounts that have, for example, forum or mailing list notifications, or emails that come in over night.) This was not the behaviour in a previous version. Emails were grouped and offered a single 'Delete all' button. I do not know if it is the version of K9 or the version of android that makes it behave differently (previously I was running the latest version of K9 on android 4.2.1). I am now running on android 7.0 (Samsung). Of course it is easier to instead tap the notification and do rapid select and delete from within the account inbox but this is a backward step given we once had the option to delete from notification. Expected behavior All new mail notifications for a single account should appear grouped in one header. That header, once expanded to show the subset of individual mails (to a certain limit - previously it was 6) should have the option to DELETE ALL to then effect a delete of all the emails in that account group. It could also enable further swipe down to expand individual emails and offer individual delete oif required. Actual behavior 3 swipe downs for each email with ability to only delete one at a time. (Process explained above) Steps to reproduce Send in 5 emails to the sam address Receive notifications Get swiping!

		Hello, I face an issue while synchronizing my Sent mails box ; the sent mails do not synchronize. The mails I send from the phone appear, but the mail I send from other devices (PC...) does not appear on the phone, even after synchronizing. I have set up the Sent mails folder as class 1 folder but this does not change the behaviour. Does anyone have an idea to solve the problem ? I expect it is not a configuration problem but I have tried many settings without success and I have no ideas anymore... Thank you for help ! Expected behavior When asking for synchronizing the Sent mails, the new mails stored on the server should appear in K-9 mail on the phone. Actual behavior No mail is synchronized. The Sent mails box only contains the mails sent by the phone. Steps to reproduce Go to Sent mails Synchronize Nothing happens Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.208 Android version: 7.1.2 LineageOS Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		It appears that somewhere between 5.208 and 5.301 some issues were introduced in the rendering the body of (single-part) plain-text messages. For instance, a message that ends with:  Davide

 If I forward the message from a 5.301 client the bottom text block is displayed correctly in the draft. There additionally appears to be a problem with hyperlinking. If the &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;https://&quot;&quot; starts in column one it is not hyperlinked. If it starts in column 2+ it is. In 5.208 the message renders correctly and all &quot;http://&quot; and &quot;https://&quot; urls are hyperlinked regardless of their column start position.

		Some servers offer the creation and storage of dedicated IMAP notes. I think that it will be useful if K-9 Mail can edit, save and delete those. Expected behavior The user is able to successfully create new and view/modify/delete existing notes in their IMAP account. Since the credentials are usually(always?) the same as the regular account, no further setup should be necessary from UX perspective. Actual behavior The user is able to only read existing notes without further setup in K-9 Mail. Steps to reproduce find a provider that supports IMAP notes create a new such note via a dedicated app or through the web interface of your account try to edit it and save your changes inside of K-9 Mail ‚Äì nothing happens (ideally, should save it) Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.208 Android version: 7.1.2 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

About half are due to OutOfMemoryErrors (shown below), which are probably more to do with my laptop than anything else.

		I've got the opposte problem of all other folks: It seems to be impossible to DISABLE syncing. This happens on my new Honor 9 with Android 7 - didnt have these issues on my One Plus X both with Android 5 nor 6. Expected behavior I disabled syncing - as far as I know - in all places, starting from the account, globally and even folder-wise. I'm using k9 as a secondary client, which only becomes important as primary one when I'm elsewhere AND still expecting work mails. I prefer control, ie. manual fetching, over auto-sync and having my smartphone screen clustered with mail notifications (notifications behaviour under Android 7 seems generally to be awkwardly off aka exploding; a total PITA to me) My guess is its a Doze-related issue, but then there must have been an extreme change between Android 6 and 7, because on 6 everything worked as expected (as noted above). Actual behavior When you &quot;turn on&quot; your phone (actually just turn on the screen), you are most of the time being greeted by new mail notifications. So the disabled sync seems to be ignored. Steps to reproduce Set up a nifty IMAP account on a regular host, including encryption etc. Install k9 Disable synchronization EVERYWHERE, including singular IMAP folders. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.302 Android version: 7.0 (EMUI 5.1) Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behavior Highly nested quotes should be hidden or not indented. If message is wider than some default width, add a scrollbar. Actual behavior More than half the screen is whitespace. The font size shrinks extremely small, I guess to avoid a scrollbar? Pic. To be fair, this looks almost as bad in Thunderbird; I guess many replies is outside of most use cases. I would like for this to be nicer, though, especially since there's so little screen space on android. Steps to reproduce Write an email with many replies (I believe this one had about 20-30) Open in K9 Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.208 Android version: 7.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behavior When connecting to an IMAP account, K9 should look for existing standard folders for Trash, Sent, Drafts, Junk on the server and respect those even if called differently. It should not create new standard folders on the server just because they do not exist under the (localized) name. If K9 cannot identify those existing folders, the user should be asked which action to take. Actual behavior When creating a new IMAP account in a localized K9 (e.g. German), it will look for standard folders on the server using localized names (e.g. Papierkorb for the trash bin). If folders with those names do not exists, they are silently created, even if there already is a folder for that purpose but with a different name. E.g. there may be a folder called Trash, but anyway K9 creates another one called Papierkorb. This ends up with K9 moving deleted mails to &quot;Papierkorb&quot;, while any other application using the same IMAP account would move them to &quot;Trash&quot;. The same bug has been reported in issue #881 which has been closed, but should not. It is an old bug and still exists.

I searched for &quot;Dossier du pousser&quot; (which is not French but is in the app) here in github but did not find it. I don't know where to look at to correct this by the standard pull requests.

		Expected behavior Using Sony Xperia Z5, with Android 7.1.1, when adding the unread mail widget to home screen, an envelope icon of the selected mail account should appear. Actual behavior Nothing happens. the Envelop icon doens't appear for some reason. other widgets of other applications work perfectly fine. Important: I have read similar issues which don't seem fully address this. while i was able to add the widget before the last android upgrade (i.e. 6.1), i'm currently unable to do so. consequently i added a new email account but couldn't add it's unread widget. while the previous accounts widgets are still there. Steps to reproduce go to widgets section after a long press on home screen. select the K-9 unread widget and drag it to home screen select a mail account in k-9 Environment K-9 Mail version: Android version: Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange):

		This is a feature request. I'd like to be able to use the Refile/Move menu to move a message to a folder in another email account than the message is currently. Right now, the Move menu only shows folders from the email's current account. Would it be possible to add a General Setting to show all accounts' folders in the Move folder list, with some indication of each folder's account, perhaps the account's color code, to distinguish folders with the same names on different accounts? Then to add code to support a move of messages in that way? Thanks. PS: If this is somehow already possible, I'm sorry that I failed to see how in both looking through the settings and in reading the docs!

		Hi, hope it's not a duplicate issue. Expected behavior When gmail account setting up manually, and IMAP prefix [Gmail] is entered, folder names must exclude [Gmail]/ part from their names. Actual behavior However, both names types exists in K-9 Gmail mailbox folders list, e.g. Trash and [Gmail]/Trash, even after folders list rebuild via menu. I check via Gmail web interface that non-expected folders not exists, via desktop IMAP client also. As workaround, I receive expected behavior, after manually edit exported gmail mailbox .k9s profile, by deleting '[Gmail]/' expression, and next importing mailbox from this edited .k9s file (samples attached).

		I've never received such an alert from Google since I started using Gmail (around 2004). After installed k-9 (which I love, that's why I'm writing this) I got that alert two times. In both opportunities I changed my password. It says the geolocation of those accesses is diverse, what's going on? I may provide further information if guided by someone more experienced. Thanks in advance, Alexandre.

		I noticed that when someone sending me email there is no way to look at the HTML source so I can review the URLs etc to see where they are going to pull images from etc. This makes is harder to determine if you are getting phished or if the images are really trackers. It would be good if we could view the raw / mime decoded email to review its contents like I can with the Alpine email (press H) client. thanks Matt

		Expected behavior I want to enable automatic encryption to recipients whom I have a key for. When I compose a new mail and add an recipient with a GPG Key in my OpenKeychain keyring, it should automatically enable encryption for this mail as well as all mails in the future. Actual behavior When I compose a new email and add an recipient with a GPG key in my OpneKeychain keyring encryption is NOT enabled and even if i enable encryption for this mail, when i compose a new email to this recipient I have to enable encryption again (which you can easily forget) Steps to reproduce Have a recipient with a GPG key in your keychain Draft a new mail in K9 Mail and add the recipient to the mail You have to manually enable encryption each time In 5.2x it was still possible to configure the general enryption mode on a global level. In 5.3x this seems to be completely gone. I have read the blog articles about your ideas about the encryption of mails but did not find anything why automatic encryption is not possible anymore.

		Problem After some actualization after new ugly icon (5.300 - 5.401) there is no notification about new mail. Reason I have diagnosted that the reason is Quiet Time ON regardless what time is set. Steps to reproduce IMAP account Synchronize Always Quiet Time: ON , Start: 22:00 , End: 7:00 Current time: 7:01 - 21:59 New mail is indicated only as notification icon, no LED, no beeping Quiet Time: OFF New mail is indicated as notification icon, LED is blinking and repro is beeping Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.401 Android version: 6.0 (Jun 12, 2017) Account type: IMAP

		I think that the logic for this has been reversed in the latest update. If I check the option to enable a quiet time and have the start set to 0700 and end to 2300 I don't get any notification sounds :-/ I only noticed it recently because I stopped getting notification sounds so it's not any option I've tweaked. I suspect the second of two recent updates.

		Expected behavior I have an email account that I connect to via POP3 with K-9 Mail, with the latter configured to: a. not synchronize any server deletions to the client, and b. never delete on the server any message that was deleted locally. The provider of the account is a hoster who do not delete any emails on their own. I also connect to the same account, again via POP3, with Claws Mail, which is configured to delete all received messages on the server 1 week after reception. Since I fetch emails with K-9 Mail every day and Claws' server deletions are not to be mirrored to K-9 Mail, I would expect the K-9 Mail Inbox to accumulate all emails it ever received, never deleting any of them from the local storage automatically. Actual behavior The K-9 Mail Inbox of that account contains no emails older than about a week (which seemingly contradicts setting a. above). [corrections 8 Jan: that the age of the oldest email was about a week was a coincidence obviously and had nothing to do with Claws' server deletions, see comment below] Steps to reproduce Set up an email account without automatic deletions at provider side. Set up Claws Mail to fetch with POP3 and deletion after . Set up K-9 Mail to fetch with POP3 and no deletion (see a., b. above). Make sure you get emails every day to that account. After the initial , you should see the oldest messages vanishing from K-9 Mail's account Inbox. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.208 Android version: 7.1.2 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): POP3

		I can close the quotation by pressing the X (but its only hidden) I can edit the quotation by pressing the pencil. But i cant delete it. I can empty it, but not delete it. Especially for mailing lists, this option would be useful to have. There could be two solutions: A delete button, earasing the quotation with no way back. A detatch button, allowing the user to still read the quoted text, but not including the quotation when sending the email. There must be a very clear clue to the user when the quotation wont actually be included, however it would be beneficial to be able to read the quotation while writing the reply. This also allows for last minute change of mind and includimg the quotation after all. Especially with mailing lists or when replying to a large number of people, removing quotations would be more convinient than writing a completely new message and adding all the addresses manually.

		Expected behavior Tell us what should happen Upon first account setup and syncing. K9 should sync(poll) with yahoo's &quot;Drafts(Drafts)&quot; folder. Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead At first account sync up K9 does not poll the yahoo created &quot;Drafts(Drafts)&quot; folder. Everything else is fine Under the folder name Drafts(Drafts) it says [Command: Examine &quot;Drafts&quot;;] Then k9 creates a new folder named &quot;Draft&quot; on its own. That folder is then created on yahoo's server. Then that error below the Drafts(Drafts) folders name disappears but the original Drafts(Drafts) folder still will not poll. In a nut shell: At the first sync with a YahooMail! account K9 will see the &quot;DraftS&quot; folder but not what's inside of it. K9 gives essential a error of [Command: Examine &quot;Drafts&quot;] Steps to reproduce 1.Make sure a draft already exists in the YahooMail original Draft folder on yahoo mails website. 2. Setup YahooMail with k9 3.view the error [Command: Examine &quot;Drafts&quot;] below the Drafts(Drafts)folder and folder does not sync. 3. Sync a few times a see the new &quot;Draft* folder created Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.402 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): Yahoo Mail IMAP

		For the past few months, K9 Mail no longer allows me to read unread mail in order. I order my mail with newest at the top. When I have new mail, I scroll down to the first unread messages and click. When I delete this message, K9 Mail previously showed me the next unread messages. Now it seems to sort the read email together which causes the 'next message' to be mail I have already read, requiring me to hit delete, next, next, next,... to get to the next unread email. It is no longer practical to read new email with K9 Mail when sorting messages to show newest first.
