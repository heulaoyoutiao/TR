		Steps: 1. Browse a gallery app and select a picture to share. 2. Select QKSMS under the share menu 3. QKSMS compose window appears. Select a contact from the &quot;Favorite Contatcs&quot; list. This contact has to have multiple phone numbers associated to the same contact. 4. Send the picture. Expected: QKSMS should ask me which phone number do I want to use to send and then just send the picture without a problem. Reality: QKSMS attempts to send the picture to all phone numbers under the same contact, which is not what I want to do. This doesn't happen if I just type the contact name instead of selecting from Favorites, because I can see the contacts phone number being used. A new conversation is created that has as members all the phone numbers from the same contact. I know that they are all the phone numbers of the same contact because this problem gets pushed to Yappy, and there I can see all the phone numbers under that conversation. The first time this new conversation is created it shows the wrong contact picture. It actually shows the picture of a different contact. I'm attaching a screenshots of the problem so it's easier to understand. The screenshot shows that the second conversation has Jennifer Thomas and somebody else (+1). The contact picture is not of Jennifer Thomas, and the &quot;+1&quot; is the same contact but a different phone number. After restarting QKSMS (removing it from memory) the picture gets updated and now there's no contact picture at all and just the number &quot;2&quot; is displayed. Meaning there's two contacts in that conversation. Another thing that can be see in the screenshot is that the first conversation reads that my message could not be sent, because one of Jennifer's numbers is a land line. One of the problems that arise when you send the MMS to all phone numbers under that contact.

		When browsing either the contacts app or the dialler app on lollipop, in my case both apps are Google's apps, tapping on a contact you have never sent a SMS to before seems to create an empty thread in Qksms. This is a pain as if you tap on a landline number, it is always certain to create an empty thread. This can lead to having multiple empty threads at the top of the app to scroll through unless deleting them everytime. Screenshot below:

		Switching from my previous messenger app to QKSMS causes QKSMS to read all of my existing messages. Somewhere, a toast is being re-created/re-shown over and over again saying &quot;Message expired or not available&quot;, so its basically always on the screen (until I kill the app). Restarting the app continues to show the toast. Perhaps a better method would be to write to a log for all messages that are expired/unavailable? Instead of clogging the UI with endless toast's?

		There's no way to select multiple messages under a conversation to either copy, export or delete them (or any other action that I can't think of). The same is true for conversations. I've seen other apps handle this by either adding a option of &quot;Select&quot; under the long press menu, or the 3-dot menu. This option selects the message (or conversation) and lets you click on others to keep selecting. The 3-dot menu would have all the actions you can perform to those messages (or conversations). 👍 5

		One thing that's been bugging me is that in a group message, the only way to tell who sent a message is by looking at the contact picture. I have my contact pictures synced with Facebook, so they change on a regular basis, and I can't always tell who sent a particular message. It would be nice if the sender's name was included in the message, either at the beginning, or as a signature at the end. Loving the app!! I love that the dev is so involved in the community and always working to improve the app.

		Hey Shane- Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. So here's what I've figured out: -I can send pictures, as long as I used the camera app first to take the picture, by selecting the picture from my gallery through your app. -If I try to take a picture through through your app, that's when I have the issue. It will take the picture but never send. -I've tried with WiFi on and off for both scenarios and, at least for me, the WiFi status doesn't matter. So in the end, I can now use MMS. I just have to take my picture first using my camera app, then send it. I am able to receive pictures without any issues though. Thank You, ---

		I'm running a verizon Moto X (2014) and I have noticed that sometimes the conversation that I am currently on when I open the app disappears. I have to select another conversation and then bring it back to get everything to show up. Sending is unaffected as well as notification receiving. I just can't see the past conversation at all. Thanks and keep up the good work!

		When trying to set a personal LED for people in my notification list I noticed a bug that meant it reset to the Original LED colour for the app and would not save. Example of how to test Set general LED colour for the app (example blue) Long hold on a conversation to bring up personal settings and then change that notification LED Back out of this conversation so you're back to the default messaging inbox screen Repeat step 2 and you can see that the initial colour of the LED is the default of the app I don't know whether this is an app wide issue or simply a problem related to my phone (Samsung galaxy S5 running 5.0).

		Problems The average user won't know what &quot;Markdown&quot; is We don't outline which parts of markdown we even support For people who don't already know the syntax, we don't state how to actually use the feature Proposed behavior Have a button on the toolbar opens a little pop up showing something alone the lines of BOLD | ITALICS | UNDERLINE When the user clicks on one, then starts typing, their text will automatically be stylized. Behind the scenes we've inserted the magic markdown characters for them, and they're invisible because the editor is showing the formatted text If they click one of the styling options while the cursor is inside a span of styled text, it'll undo that style for that selection

		It would be great if you can implement a sms blocker function : block by keyword, block by number. Block by keyword is filtering unknown incoming sms by a list of keyword defined by a user. Block by number is filtering incoming sms by a list of phone number defined by a user. Thank you.

		v1.10.4 on Nexus 6. Also occurs on N5 The QK Reply feature is fantastic but it should be disabled if qksms is the currently active application. There's no need to popup an alert for an app you're already using.

		Add an ability to block incoming sms. It could be either whitelist (e.g. your contact list) or blacklist. The way Google's Messenger do this, is each conversation has a 'People' button, and you can block that sender from there. You still recieve messages from them, but there is no notification and they are automatically archived (so you don't see them in your main SMS window).

		Hi, It could be good to be able to hide sender too in Notification. I think you can just rename Setting entry by something like &quot;Hide content of message in notification&quot; which will be responsible to hide the content, and create a new entry &quot;Hide sender in notification&quot;. Then we will eb able to hide one of them or both as we want. Well it's kinda easy to do but I have no time to edit code and pull a request ;p

		I like night mode. I like colored message bubbles, even in night mode. However, I do not like colored app bars in night mode An actual separate app bar color option would be a bit clunky, and clunkier still if there were a separate separate one for the dark theme. A simple switch, though, to make the app use this color only for the app bar in dark mode and actual black in AMOLED mode, is something I think could work quite nicely.

		Automatic night mode doesn't work. It was fixed in a previous update (I think 1.7 or something), but it appears to be broken again. It works each time I reset it (check and uncheck the box and reselect the times), but it kind of defeats the purpose of automatic night mode by doing that. I'm running 2.0.1

Then I have a specific notification sound set in QKSMS for one specific contact, let's call it sound B and that contact person B. I received an SMS message from one of my contacts, sound A played. All good yet. I did not read the message, it was still in my notification shade (and thus on the lockscreen notifications list too) and I received another message, this time from person B, so sound B should have played.

		MMS doesn't work as well as it does in Textra. I don't receive any pictures, and occasionally a group text will sort of work. I always have my data turned off. Textra will tell me when I need data on in order to get a text. QK never tells me, so I end up unable to receive. I can usually send to a group a text. I know this isn't very detailed, I'll give you more info if you ask me.

This happens even though I have the &quot;Wake phone&quot; setting disabled both in general settings and in specific contact's settings. Anyone else noticing this unpleasant behaviour? Do you need some additional data to investigate? Nexus 6, Android 5.1.1, QKSMS 2.0.1 EDIT: I noticed I am not alone: https://plus.google.com/u/0/108762715235332764384/posts/FjbgtUP1pvn EDIT 2: This happens only with one specific contact for which I have set separate notification sound, other contacts don't do this. However, as I stated, the &quot;Wake phone&quot; setting is disabled both in general settings and in the specific contact's settings. Also, the contact's notification settings are identical to general notification settings, except for the sound.

		Sometimes a number is received from a contact and it is already on contact list. It would be great if QKSMS replace the number by the name of the contact and type of number (mobile, home, ...) This resource is implemented in Chomp SMS and is very useful with cell services that sends SMS messages with missed calls while the phone was unreachable or turned off.

			<description>
		After deleting multiple threads on an LG G5, on current Android build. A new text will come in. In the app view it says the wrong contact, when clicking on the message it then shows the proper contact who sent the message. Replies are sent to both recipients until the thread is deleted, or application is force stopped. This happens after reinstallation, clearing cache, any time you receive a message shortly after deleting multiple threads. Steps to reproduce: Have multiple SMS threads in inbox Delete all but 1 Thread (Optional) Receive a new message from a new recipient Reply to the non-deleted thread Expected Behavior: Message will be sent to displayed recipient. Current Behavior: Message is sent to the recipient of one of the deleted threads, not the displayed recipient, and a new messaging thread to the unintended recipient will be created. Appears to send message to the recipient of the most current, deleted thread. Workaround: Force Closing the application This has occurred on multiple phones and across updates to Android, the LG G3, G4, and a Nexus 5.

Idk if there's an easy way to do this but it would definitely add to the overall Polish of the app. keep up the great work!

		Clicking &quot;Read&quot; on the lock screen doesn't clear the pop up box when the screen is unlocked. Instead it clears the message in the box, leaving an empty box. Then, when I get a text from someone else, the new box does not show up, it still shows the empty box from the previous, read text. I'm using an OnePlus One running Exodus. QKSMS version 2.1.0﻿

		If I lock my phone while in the app and I receive a message, the notification quickly pops and disappears again. I also tried to see if being in another conversation to the one that received the message affected it, but it seems the message disappears no matter what conversation I'm in when the phone locks. This is on a Galaxy S6 SM-G920F, Android 5.1.1 and QkSMS 2.0.1

		If QKSMS is left as the active application when the phone screen turns off, changing the orientation of the phone before turning the screen back on can cause the conversation window to go blank. Returning to the list of conversations will blank out that list as well. The problem is fixed by clearing the application from the recent applications list. This seems to have started as of the October 21st update. Device: Moto X (2nd Generation) Android version: 5.1 Carrier: U.S. Cellular Steps to reproduce: Open QKSMS Open any conversation While in portrait orientation, press the power button on the phone to turn off the screen Rotate the phone to landscape orientation Turn the screen back on (and unlock the device if necessary) Observe the blank conversation screen Use the back button of the phone or the application to return to the conversation list Observe a lack of converstions Use the Recent Applications list to clear QKSMS Re-open QKSMS. All functionality is restored.

		I was interested in this application until I saw what permissions are required to run this software. 40 permissions seems rather excessive for an application that essentially reads/writes SMS. There's no detailed info on the additional features this application brings to the party. For instance, why would it need to &quot;Control Near Field Communication&quot;, &quot;Change Wi-Fi state&quot;, &quot;Fine (GPS) location&quot;, &quot;Take pictures and videos&quot;, &quot;Record audio&quot;, &quot;Directly call phone numbers&quot;? Perhaps it would be helpful if more information could be provided about this application. That way people like me could understand the reasons behind such permission requests.

		Certain issues prevent me from getting screenshots, but: If you have a picture message that's recent enough that it shows up within the first screen of a conversation so it's visible without scrolling, it doesn't render unless scrolled off-screen and then scrolled back onto the screen. While invisible, timestamps and such just act as if there's a bubble there when there isn't.

		Just installed marshmallow last night, fresh charge going to work. Not even an hour later I have a battery warning at 15%. I wish I had taken a screenshot, but it slipped my mind. QKSMS had used 137% battery over the last 24 hours at that point. 98% active rate in RAM. Perhaps a 6.0 bug with perms or something? Just insane. My phone was practically on fire by the time I noticed.

		Really like the app, but one thing I would like to suggest be implemented would be that the expandable message sidebar have an option to always be visible in a minimized way similar to Hello SMS and Evolve SMS but can easily be swiped to expand, and also add perhaps a little number as a notification icon on each message to show how many new messages each one has and for those with no pic, just use the contacts initials, or the last few numbers in their phone number or something?. Here is a shitty photoshop I whipped together to demonstrate (I didnt optimize the space usage on the left of the contact icons or anything obviously) If you were able to do this, I would definitely use and recommend it to anyone looking for a good text app. : )&quot; Thanks! http://i.imgur.com/0xdlUck.jpg

		I'm having this issue where sometimes, seemingly random, text messages wont get sent. They're stuck at &quot;sending&quot;. Even if I send another one right after, which gets sent and delivered, the previous on does not go anywhere. All is good when I use the stock messaging app (xperia lollipop 5.1.1) and if I switch back to that, the messages that QKSMS failed to sent off will eventually be sent by the stock app. What on earth can it be? Kind of seems to me like these third party texting apps functioned better back in the day where they were dependent on the stock app...

		...or at least make this behavior configurable. Steps to reproduce: User scrolled up to read some past messages in a long conversation. User deletes a message. Expected behavior: Messages newer than the deleted one (below it) are moved up. This is how the stock 5.1 Messaging app works. Actual behavior: Message list scrolls down to the newest message.

However, when i tested the same gif on another sms app (Textra), it sent perfectly and was animated on the receiving side (as well as on senders side). Thanks for your time.

I wish you can add an option to change received/sent message bubble colour. I used to use Textra and my received bubble is blue and sent bubble is green, it's really easy to read in the dark mode.

		Hi, I love your app but it miss a feature that prevents me to use your app. I use the default messaging app on the ASUS Zenfone 2, ASUS Messaging. Normally SMS are listed in the Main category. Then, there are two other categories: VIP: shows all messages of VIP contacts, set in the ASUS Contacts app. Those message are shown also in the main section and the profile pic has a VIP badge Private: all messages sent in the Private category are protected by a numeric password. Those messages are not shown in the main category I don't use VIP category but I use Private category and by now, QKSMS doesn't show any private messages, as they have been deleted. Is it possible to implement categories? Instead of just VIP category, you should implement a category for every group in the contacts.

		It would be great if QKSMS have this feature. When in conversation view, swipe (slide) left to bring the next conversation. It's a one of the most needed feature. Suppose, if there is a long list of conversation, it would be easier to slide and read the conversations rather than going back and opening one by one. I know it has the last opened conversation feature when we swipe right. But you can divide half of the screen like Upper half of the screen brings back the main Inbox (sliding right, as per now). And the bottom half of the screen may be used as navigating through different conversations (left and right). Just a suggestion.

		Scenario: receive a message, enter app to view message, after which I lock my screen with the app still up, a new message comes in from the same sender, I unlock my screen and the quick reply window is open for that new message while displaying overtop of the same conversation open below the quick reply window. I'm not sure if this is a bug, but it's not ideal for use. It delays access to the actual conversation. Perhaps add some test to see whether qksms is up/active when unlocking screen to determine whether to open quick reply window?

		I noticed that if a conversation is open and I get a new message it just pops up without any notification. This is okay if I constantly stare at my phone but usually I just put down while the screen is on and do something else so if I get a new message I simply don't notice. It would be nice to have some kind of notification for that, a sound or just vibration. Better selectable in the settings.

I'm using QKSMS and I've noticed that, the popup doesn't extend while I try to extend in order to see more thant the new sms. The problem is that when I try to extend the popup, the app shutdown and I have to re-open it again and go through the app to view all the messages.

		Hi there, First off, love the app been using it for over a month without any issue. Just recently, QKSMS has been preventing my phone from going into deep sleep. I must force close the app and then the CPU will go into deep sleep. I've tried clearing app cache, app data, uninstalling, and wiping the cache all to no avail. I've since switched to Textra (really don't want to) and its no longer happening. If there's any more information I can provide, please let me know. Oxygen OS 2.1.3x OnePlus X

		When going back to the message list view from any view (message content view, main settings) by pressing soft back key, on the left side there appears a weird graphical glitch during the animation. It looks like something is drawn incorrectly in the animation. Some sort of brief vertical bar/line flash (not great description). I think this appeared after the latest updated (Jan 7: v2.5.1). Unfortunately I don't have another device so I can't take a video and direct screen recorders do not show the glitch properly. Motorola Moto G 3rd Gen Lollipop 5.1.1 QKSMS 2.5.1

		Hi! I just want to say that QKSMS is absolutely amazing! I just started using it, and tyvm for such a great FOSS messaging app! I downloaded the app from F-Droid, and when I go to donate through Google it tells me that this version of the app is not configured for billing through Google Play. Does this mean I have to install through the Play Store, or is something just not set up yet? Thanks again for all your hard work, awesome job devs!

		Hi, I am on a team that uses GroupMe. They just have to have it. However, I refuse to install the proprietary app on my phone (I don't even have Google Play on my phone). GroupMe apparently allows members to opt non-members in by setting up an account for them with their phone number. When this happens, the person without the software (me) receives a text message instead (maybe it is called MMS--unsure). However, it does not fetch the images. Is it possible to: Create a &quot;fetch URL images&quot; option for a thread? This would, when switched on, a) fetch all URL images from the server automatically for a certain thread and b) keep it locally on the phone so that it could c) display the image in the thread. Make that option available to be torified? Many thanks! Thanks! Devin

		Is it possible to be able to add a title to a particular thread? Long click the thread Select that you want to &quot;add a descriptive title&quot; Give it a title The title should then display instead of the numbers. This is helpful for those who are subscribed to services like GroupMe, where the phone number displayed is meaningless and it does not make sense to make a contact for the phone number that the texts are sent from. I can provide an image if you like, but I would need to blur the phone numbers for privacy reasons.

		The current MMS Configuration tool is awkward and not clear about QK SMS requires the user to do. I have MMS settings correctly set under my APN configuration. Do I need to re-do the settings again? If QK MMS settings don't match my APN settings, what are the ramifications? If I choose not to set MMS settings under QK, will QK still work correctly? If I use system settings, how do I make the MMS setup reminders go away? Can I view what QK has determined my settings should be, without seperately entering MMSC, MMS proxy, and MMS port to verify that they are correct? I propose the following layout for QK MMS configuration: Current MMS configuration layout: MMS Configuration Automatically Configure MMS MMSC MMS proxy MMS port Suggested layout: MMS Configuration MMS Configuration Preference (selected preference in small text) MMSC (&quot;Default&quot; or MMSC setting in small text) MMS proxy (&quot;Default&quot; or proxy setting in small text) MMS port (&quot;Default&quot; or port setting in small text) &quot;MMS Configuration Preference&quot; would bring up a dialog with three options: Use device MMS settings QK automatic MMS configuration Manual MMS configuration For the &quot;Use device MMS settings&quot; option: &quot;Use device MMS settings&quot; would be listed in small text under &quot;MMS Configuration Preference&quot; &quot;Default&quot; would be listed under (each, in small text) MMSC, MMS proxy, and MMS port MMSC, MMS proxy, and MMS port would all be ghosted, and not edit-able This should be the default preference For the &quot;QK automatic MMS configuration&quot; option: &quot;QK automatic MMS configuration&quot; would be listed in small text under &quot;MMS Configuration Preference&quot; Auto-populated field settings would be listed under (each, in small text) MMSC, MMS proxy, and MMS port MMSC, MMS proxy, and MMS port would all be ghosted, and not edit-able For the &quot;Manual MMS configuration&quot; option: &quot;Manual MMS configuration&quot; would be listed in small text under &quot;MMS Configuration Preference&quot; MMSC, MMS proxy, and MMS port would each be edit-able User-defined field settings would be listed under (each, in small text) MMSC, MMS proxy, and MMS port The QK SMS dialog that asks the user to &quot;Set up MMS?&quot; should give the following options: Use my device's MMS settings (save and go to QK) Let QK SMS automatically configure my MMS settings (bring up list of networks, save, go to QK) I want to manually configure my MMS settings (bring up dialog with MMSC, proxy, and port) 👍 1

		Most of the time when I receive a message, QK Reply shows a wrong contact and no message inside the popup. I did not dare to enter something in the reply field, but when clicking outside of the popup or ... &gt; &quot;Open conversation&quot; shows the wrong message thread too. This has been happening for about 6 months. The reason I did not report this before is because I was trying to discover what triggered this. It happens about 80% of the time, so makes QK Reply really useless actually. QKSMS version: 2.5.1 Android version: 6.0.1 (build number MMB29S)

			<description>
		Dear QKSMS Developers, I am implementing a hang-bug detection tool and I am analyzing QKSMS (master version downloaded today) with it. I found that the main thread of QKSMS, frequently calls 3 particular functions: com.moez.QKSMS.mmssms.Transaction.sendSmsMessage(Transaction.java:200) android.content.ContentResolver.insert(ContentResolver.java:1231), com.moez.QKSMS.mmssms.Transaction.sendSmsMessage(Transaction.java:237) android.telephony.SmsMessage.calculateLength(SmsMessage.java:424), com.moez.QKSMS.mmssms.Transaction.sendSmsMessage(Transaction.java:256) android.telephony.SmsManager.divideMessage(SmsManager.java:410), when an SMS is sent. In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bug) experienced with QKSMS. Moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. I suspect that it is actually possible to run those functions on a background thread. Therefore, do you think that it is possible to move off the main thread those functions to improve responsiveness? Also, where you aware of these problems? Thanks for any information, I hope I can help improve QKSMS.

		I can't see any scroll-bar when scrolling through the conversation list or inside a conversation. As I can't find any reason why this should not be there, I conclude it is a bug?! I use v2.5.2 as standard app with Android 5.1@Fairphone2. 👍 1

		I would love if qksms would integrate a fast way (like a shortcut) to activete the &quot;Delivery Report&quot; just for this one message which is currently typed and will be send next. Maybe just a new button in the compose window or a new entry in the &quot;...&quot;-option menu or something else, which is reachable within one click and which is only temporarely without changing the standard settings of the delivery reports. Thanks for implementing this.

		Now the remaining characters for a SMS is started to count down beginning with 10. To fit a sentence in 1 SMS it does not help much to see only the counter appearing during the last allowed word. I need to see it always when typing. This late appearence is not helpful in my opinion. Display the counter always or make the limit customizable! Thanks. 👍 1

		Hi One of the very few setting that misses in QKsms is to be able to repeat notifications (vibrations,...) for a defined number of times and intervals. Because we sometimes don't notice them when the phone is on our pocket. This feature exists for example in textra ou chompsms. Thanks Arnaud

		When I try to select an sms to open &quot;Option message&quot; view, if there is a number, like a telephone number or something like that, which is highlighted, the &quot;Option message&quot; view doesn't appear! It appears only if I select the row but outside the window of the message. This is surely a problem if the message is very long and there isn't the contact icon so there's not a lot of place to select the row!

		Using QKSMS 2.5.2 on Android 5.1.1. Here's how the bug happened: Created a new contact named &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; the phone number of which is mine. Took a picture (res: 3840*2160, file size: 2,67MO) with my stock phone app. Used the &quot;share&quot; button, selected QKSMS which brought up the Quick Reply interface with the picture embedded. Sent the picture to the &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; contact with the word &quot;test&quot; attached. Now, whenever I try to open my conversation with &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, the app crashes everytime.

		At the moment, the search function only crawls through the messages contents to look for the search word. But I do missing the option, that I can also search for a contacts name to directly jump into the corresponding conversation (without scrolling 1 minute down in the start view, if it is a month ago). Can this be please implemented? Maybe with a small radio buttion to choose between &quot;messages&quot; and &quot;persons&quot;. Thanks!

		At the moment during composing a&quot;new message&quot; the conversation history is empty, which makes sense. But also after I already typed and selected a contact, it stays empty and I just see my composing message. It would be a big improvement, if also the conversations history is loaded, after I selected exactly one contact, for which a history is available. It would mean, that the &quot;compose new&quot; window should turn into the &quot;reply&quot; window, after a contact is selected in the receiver box. This would avoid the need to scroll down the long list of conversations, to find a contact and its conversations from a longer time ago. Thanks for implementing this.

		Today I used the search function to find a message with a contact. (basically I looked only for the contact-history of this contact, but the search for contacts is still missing in qksms...), Anyway: I selected one message of the search results of the desired contacts and could compose a new message to this contact. In this normal compose window only the last message was displayed, but the contacts name was in the title - so everything seemed OK. I hit send and the message seemed to be sent. But: I can't find this message anymore, neither in the conctac's conversation, nor in the message-overview, nor in the standard Android SMS-App, nor with the search function. So, where is it? Was is sent? Why I cant find it anymore? I did not get any error message.... What's happening here? Can anybody reproduce this?

		Scenario: after working with qksms (composing, sending...) and you changed the app or switched off the display and go back to qksms: Current behaviour: qksms is exactly continued at the screen where you left it (despite a real &quot;kill app&quot; was performed) This behaviour is OK for a couple of minutes, if you want directly jump into the old conversation again. Desired behaviour: If qksms is inactive for, let's say 5 min, it should start again in the main message screen to have a better overview. Could be opt-in in settings (with desired minutes, or disabled). In the past it happended very often for me, that I don't want to see the old conversation again while there no new messages have been received. But I want to check the other conversations or start a new one --&gt; main screen is neccassary.

And by using the &quot;changelog&quot; function in qksms itself I never know if this content is gathered from any server (thus is beeing up-to-date) or if it is only the date of the app included? Furthermore in the changelog-screen there should be noted, which version currently is installed. Otherwise I then have to go to settings--&gt;About to see the current version, have to remeber what the &quot;changelog-screen&quot; told me and not really know, If already any new version is out, as there is no timestamp in the changelog-screen, when it was updated.

		I guess it's this bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=26194 Props to @M66B for tracking the issue for his projects. I did a quick implementation of this for Neamar/KISS#413 Here (I guess) it's in QKSwitch but maybe it needs a proper dev that can implement this with android.support.v7.widget.SwitchCompat instead of android.preference.SwitchPreference the above projects use.

		DESCRIPTION It would be extremely helpful in certain situations if 2 or more conversations could be merged into a single conversation. Example in case of a person having 2 different mobiles numbers and using whichever depending on which has the best reception at his location. A conversation with him will be split over 2 unless both can be merged. Also commercial SMS say from a bank arrive from different headers such as VM-SBI, VX-SBI, TV-SBI etc. Merging them into a common SBI or a user selected option could make life much easier. This feature is present in another application called Disa.

		DESCRIPTION This looks like two orientation modes are independent: qksms remember last opened conversation is landscape mode and returns to it from any other conversation when rotating from portrait mode also: after this switch conversations have wrong title (from another conversation) STEPS rotate to landscape mode open a conversation A http://i.imgur.com/K4vfZw9.jpg close conversation A rotate to portrait mode open conversation B (http://i.imgur.com/6HMd1ml.jpg) rotate to landscape mode -- u can see conversation A with wrong title: http://i.imgur.com/g10Pmxr.jpg rotate back to portrait mode. Here we have again conversation B, but with same wrong title: http://i.imgur.com/a1u11hl.jpg EXPECTED No changes between landscape and portrait modes OBSERVATIONS conversation switches to another and changes conversation title (from some another conversation) I have 2.5.4 version of qksms from f-droid repo

		DESCRIPTION When sending group messages while I am connected to Wifi the messages just get stuck on &quot;sending&quot;. I have the &quot;Automatic data&quot; option turned on. This happened on my Galaxy S4 (5.0.1) and now my new Galaxy S7 (Marshmallow). I am on Verizon Wireless. STEPS Connect to Wifi Send group message Turning off wifi before sending the message or rebooting after trying usually gets the message to go through. EXPECTED The message to go through immediately without any problems. OBSERVATIONS The message hangs on &quot;sending&quot;. I usually then try turning off my wifi and waiting to see if it goes through. If it doesn't I will reboot my phone then it usually goes.

		Hi, I've noticed that in group texts it doesn't show the name of the person who sent the message most of the time (it seems like it's normally just the last message received). If I click on the message to view more details it will show the number of who it is from but not their name. Sometimes under the message it will show the time it was received and the contact who sent it (again, I think it's just the last received message). Would it be possible to make this show up for all messages in group texts? Sometimes I will receive multiple messages so I wont know who sent what. Thank you and keep up the good word! This is by far my favorite messaging app I've ever used!

		DESCRIPTION I'm having issues sending/receiving MMS messages while connected to a VPN. I used to think this was Wifi issue but after more troubleshooting it turns out it's the VPN. STEPS Connect to VPN (such as OpenVPN) Try to send/receive MMS EXPECTED The message should be received/sent without issue. OBSERVATIONS I think I may have found the solution to this problem. I started trying many different texting apps while troubleshooting my MMS issue and ended up finding a setting in Textra called &quot;MMS Behavior&quot;. By default it's set to &quot;Legacy&quot; and under that it says &quot;Try 'System' if legacy MMS isn't work (for example with Project Fi, VPNs, WiFi MMS, etc).&quot; So I then set it to &quot;System&quot; and it appears to have fixed the problem. I have seen this option in other apps such as YAATA SMS and ChompSMS. Is this something that could be added? I'm not sure how difficult something like this would be to add because I'm not a programmer. It seems like maybe it's just a switch saying use the system settings on the phone instead of the app settings. Hopefully it's something simple and easy that can be added to this app! For the time being I am just using Textra because I don't want to miss out on messages but I prefer QKSMS over any of the messaging apps I've tried! Even with all the different customizations on the other apps I still want to come back to this one :) 👍 2

		DESCRIPTION The app crashes if the quick reply window is drawn over the app itself, apparently only if it's reached from the lock screen. STEPS Open QK. Lock the screen with the power button, or allow it to lock itself. Receive a text message. Turn on the screen and hit 'Reply' on the notification. 5a. Type a reply and hit send. OR 5b. Dismiss the quick reply window. EXPECTED The reply window should simply close. If a message has been typed when the window is dismissed then it should be saved to draft. If a message had been SENT then it should in fact be sent, after which the quick reply window should simply close. OBSERVATIONS The screen will go dark and revert to the conversations menu, and if attempting to send a message then said message is not sent, nor is it saved as a draft. It simply disappears.

		Android 5.1.1 (stock Nexus6) QKSMS 2.5.4 http://imgur.com/a/H4YpD Not sure what exactly is causing it but I've included screenshots of: Battery stats page Detailed battery stats for QKSMS App Info WLD info page showing MMS Connectivity being the culprit MMS settings page I can't be certain of when this started. I don't pay too close attention to these things and just happened to notice that QKSMS was riding pretty high on the battery usage when I happened to look today. I get MMS messages just fine and rarely ever send them myself but I have had ZERO issues sending or receiving MMS. I'm on wifi usually. Things I will try in the mean time while you look into the issue... Disable AFWall Reset all QKSMS settings and user data Beyond that, I don't know what else externally would be affecting it.

		Hi, What i want to do ? I want to sync my sms and send some with a 3rd party open source website. How ? I see that you already support the Yappi API. So we can use this API and just change the URL that you use to sync. You can defined anything you want and be a standard. (The easiest) You can make something to authorize local app to send sms. Because they can access to other info. Regards,

		DESCRIPTION I'm just testing QKSMS; I have used the stock SMS app until now. Whenever I want to see the report of a message which has not been sent with QKSMS (rather with the stock app of Android 5.1.1), QKSMS crashes. The reason might be that the stock app did not store all the time stamps (only time sent, but not time delivered). However, since all the information in the message report is also contained in the dialog &quot;message details&quot;, it is not a big issue and the dialog &quot;message report&quot; could be just removed. STEPS open message thread and navigate to an older message, which has not been sent with QKSMS. long-press the time stamp to open the context menu choose &quot;view report&quot; (Bericht ansehen in German) EXPECTED A dialogue window opens showing the message report dialog with the receiver's number, receiving status, delivery time. OBSERVATIONS The app crashes and is getting closed.

		Dear developers of qksms, I am a student majoring in Computer Science. We are trying to use existing bug reports and fixes of bugs caused by specific devices to help detect and fix similar bugs of other active applications. We have detected that in your app, method setSupportActionBar of android support library v7 is used in com.moez.QKSMS.ui.base.QKActivity: void reloadToolbar(). However, we have observed that invoking this method on some Samsung devices running 4.2 system will crash your app. We have found discussions in in the bug tracking system of Android: here. as well as a stack overflow question: appcompat-v7 v21.0.0 causing crash on Samsung devices with Android v4.2.2 A suggested fix for it is to add -keep class !android.support.v7.internal.view.menu.**,** {*;} to the proguard rules. Thank you vey much. Hope this information is useful for you.

		Despite the fact that I read all the messages, the little bubble on the app icone doesn't disapear. And the number seems to change when I open certain conversation. I think it's happening when I mark a message as read from the popup Window (the check button on the Quick view). Hope my explanation will help.

		At some situations (after an import of messages are some conversations broken, or if I can view all messages received in a few last days) is more effective to view list of received / sent / all messages sorted only by their timestamps. Can you add these views as an alternative to the conversation view? There are almost no applications with this feature.

		I'm not sure if it's because of me being weird or because I'm not a native English speaker. But I often press &quot;Read&quot; when I want to reply to the message, thinking &quot;read&quot; as in &quot;read the message&quot; not &quot;mark it as read&quot;. As a right handed person I naturally read the option closes to my thumb and not the first option to the left. If the option read &quot;Mark as read&quot; this wouldn't be a problem, at least not for me. :)

		DESCRIPTION QKSMS 2.5.1 conversations are not always sent to the selected receiver. Sometimes they are send to someone else on the contact list.

			<description>
		DESCRIPTION When a MMS or group message is received, QKSMS does not produce any notification - no sound, popup, icon, anything. The only way you can tell if a new message was received is if the app is opened, and a thread has the new message dot on it. Normal SMS messages are notifying as expected. STEPS Receive MMS or group message Wonder what your friend is talking about when they ask why you didn't respond to their message EXPECTED To receive a notification exactly like receiving SMS's. OBSERVATIONS Absolutely nothing observable occurs when an MMS or group message is received. However, if one opens the QKSMS app, it does show as new in there.

STEPS Select a Conversation Select &quot;Block&quot; from top menu Conversation hides from Inbox EXPECTED Blocked conversation should never show up in Inbox again.

		Hello, In top menu of a specific conversation, I think it could be use full to add an opion to batch edit. It would be easier to delete or lock multiple sms at once. When activating this 'mode' a check box need to appear in the same line of each sms/mms to allow to select or no this sms/mms At the bottom there could be other option like: invert selection, select all, unselect all and apply to selection with 2 options : lock or delete. In both case a popup should appear to ask confirmation (in case of deletion, you need to add a warning to prevent that it is irreversible) If locked sms are selected to be deleted add in the warning that x sms are locked and will be deleted. Thank you for QKsms :)

		Nexus 6, 5.1.1, stock, no funky fonts or anything. QKSMS v2.6.1 The icon, title of QKSMS, and the read/reply/call text are all difficult to read due to being white. Hangouts for example, uses a green icon, with green text. Gmail is red. Also, just as a visual improvement... if the contact does not have an icon associated or a number has no contact, I don't see why an icon should be displayed to the right (the blank white circle). Is it not possible to show a transparent icon there so as to look empty?

		DESCRIPTION Most recent android dialer offers the capability of rejecting an incoming call using predefined text messages (something like: I'm busy, I'll call you back). When using QKSMS, we lose this feature. STEPS Set QKSMS as default app on a Phone A From a phone B, call A Reject the incoming call on A with a message using the dialer feature EXPECTED Phone B receives a message OBSERVATIONS Phone B does NOT receive the message Checked against Samsung default messaging app, Google Messenger and hangouts, Textra, etc. and all worked. Tested both on Samsung and Nexus devices.

		DESCRIPTION There are transitions in QKSMS that cannot be disabled if Animation off is set in Android's Developer options. These settings effectively disable all the transitions in apps and system, except for certain particular transitions in some games. But QKSMS is an ordinary semi-lightweight Modern Look app, so it should have its transitions implemented with standard Android API functions. This bug reports concentrates on the fact that the transition is non-standard, so this is not a duplicate of #497 (nor #529) - but it would probably solve them both. STEPS Go to the conversation Return to inbox EXPECTED Inbox is displayed as fast as possible. OBSERVATIONS Weird, slow transition appears which unnecessarily delays the display of expected screen while also producing a few bugs. Inbox is displayed, but not as fast as possible.

		DESCRIPTION If you are scrolling through past messages received through one conversation and receive a message for another conversation, the initial conversation you're scrolling through (history of messages) will scroll (very fast) to the very end of that conversation. STEPS Conversation 1 and Coversation 2 (C1 and C2) Have at least two conversations going. Scroll up to look through past message history in C1. When C2 receives a message while looking through C1 history, C1 will scroll all the way to the bottom of message history (it did not receive a message) EXPECTED C1 and C2 receive messages, but one does not adversely affect the other. OBSERVATIONS When C2 receives a message while looking through C1 history, C1 will scroll all the way to the bottom of message history (it did not receive a message)

		Users with an Android version before KitKat account for approximately 7% of QKSMS' active users By removing support for these devices, they'll still have access to all releases prior to the change, but only users with KitKat+ will be able to update. Removing it will allow us to make the codebase substantially cleaner, as KitKat introduced a ton of official APIs for SMS and MMS. We'll be able to get rid of a lot of code and probably fix a few bugs in the process. I'm leaning towards stripping out support in favor of a cleaner codebase and less legacy code. Anyone have any input on this? 👍 4

		DESCRIPTION Following resolution of the bug affecting loss of conversation when switching to landscape, the QKSMS app is now reluctant to enter landscape at all. Billic's final comment within issue 443 is the same issue. STEPS Open QKSMS in portrait Put phone in landscape layout EXPECTED QKSMS should switch to landscape. OBSERVATIONS If the phone starts in landscape mode (i.e., open a browser and switch to landscape) and QKSMS is then launched or switched to, it will then toggle between layouts without losing the conversation. Tested on a Moto G running Android 5.1 and Samsung SM-G900v running Android 5.0 with QKSMS 2.6.3.

		DESCRIPTION My device is the HTC Desire Z which has a physical keyboard, and I'm running CM11 (Android 4.4.4). QKSMS has been a welcome upgrade to the standard SMS app. My only real issue is that when I run the app with the keyboard closed, and open the keyboard at any time, QKSMS sometimes crashes. STEPS Start QKSMS on a phone with a physical keyboard with the keyboard closed. Open the keyboard at any subscreen (the main message list, a conversation, etc) EXPECTED I hope that it would not crash. OBSERVATIONS QKSMS hesitates to shift from portrait to landscape, and then crashes. It does not always happen, and I've found that I encounter the issue more &quot;in the wild&quot; than when I try to randomly test it by opening and closing.

		When using the dark background colour as well as a dark theme colour, settings headings and icons become extremely hard to see. It'd be great if there was an option to change the heading/icons (accent I think it's called) colours seperately from the theme or top bar colour, so that this could be fixed.

		I'm trying to figure out which folders and files would be the minimum (lite) version of QKSMS. I downloaded the zip file with the project and tried to build it buy Android Studio reported that one statement in one of the files required a minimum API of 21, so I stopped there. Can anyone give me some tips on which folders in the project are core functionality to be able to use both SMS and MMS, and which can be removed? I'd like to omit styles if possible as I want to use the project as a plugin for my app.

		DESCRIPTION With the markdown syntax activated the underscore contained in urls will be deleted because of markdown. So the URL will be incorrect and the user will get a 404 error. STEPS Activate markdown syntax ; Send yourself an URL like this http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3guigq_funny-animals-keyboard-cat-96-tears_animals ; Click on the URL ; Get a 404 error because the URL was reformated and is not good anymore. EXPECTED The URL should not be reformated. OBSERVATIONS The underscore in the URL are used as markdown marks so they are removed from the url. PATCH I will be treated as a clown but a simple patch consists to inactivate markdown for the message if it contains an URL. Here is a quick and dirty patch : https://framabin.org/?7db6d7ef7dc80b19#XhSyE7pM1a4fm7sfVOmjOZU3wqQ8bYuLbhSVUjEZuVA= DISCUSSIONS I think that it is important to discuss this problem because it is not as simple as it seems. My solution is clearly not good, but it is pretty hard to handle correctly URL because what is exactly an URL ? In QKSMS it seems that \w{\w|\d}*.\w+ is an URL, but how are we supposed to handle an URL like this : http://wayback.archive.org/web/\*/http://google.com (remove the backslash before the asterisk) or the one I gave in example above. I know that using hyphens in URL should be preferred over using underscore. So I do not think that it is possible to handle ALL the URL but we can clearly find a better solution than mine.

		In addition to #207 it is best to add SIP message as well. Only voip.ms from playstore that have apps only for SIP text. But it tight to only voip.ms service. Maybe if you kind enough to add SIP message support it would be wonderful. There are lot of voip apps that can do SIP messaging but it is not focus on message. Like csipsimple and zoiper for an example, it is bad for organizing message. A lot of people love the built-in android SIP, but limited only to SIP call. As more people use SIP, the need of android SIP SIMPLE companion is rise. The SIP address can be taken from &quot;Internet Call&quot; field in contacts, and SIP settings can be taken from android SIP settings. No need for presence or file transfer or whatever fancy text like WA. But pure Text like SMS.

		DESCRIPTION Moto 4 Android 6.0.1 I set ( in general settings) Starred contacts to show. This is useful as a type of work-around to make it easier to send group SMS. However I then saw that after adding say 8 or 9 in the compose screen - I regularly send an SMS to a group of 10 - the compose screen send to section became too cluttered. When I went back and switched off Starred Contacts the setting restored itself to on ( albeit with the arrow pointing left beside the &quot;STARRED CONTACTS&quot; text in the compose screen - the actual contacts not showing but the &quot;STARRED CONTACTS&quot; text remaining). A further visit to the general settings screen showed the option slider to have restored itself to the right i.e. on. This persisted after a restart and an uninstall and reinstall STEPS Switch general settings to show starred contacts Note that the compose screen now shows starred contacts ( 4 across) Switch starred contacts off in the general settings screen &quot;STARRED CONTACTS&quot; remains in the compose screen General setting slider has gone back to to the right EXPECTED All reference to starred contacts should disappear from the compose screen OBSERVATIONS I note that in settings &quot;QK Compose&quot; the text says &quot;QK Compose, starred contacts. Entering into the settings screen only &quot;QK Compose enabled&quot; setting is present with the slider set to the left

		Just upgraded from 2.5.4 and want to say thanks for all of your work, especially: fixed rotation support fixed scrolling to the bottom all the time timestamps for messages are now configurable Cheers! :-) However: When you press the back button from a conversation to the message list, it flickers to the background briefly before showing what it should. Kinda annoying and a regression IMO. My contacts which have names STILL show just the number in some certain cases. This is old but I was hoping it'd be fixed by now. These from five minutes playing around. Will add anything new that I find tomorrow. Too late to send SMSes now.

If you answer to the last visible SMS through the lock screen notification, the SMS will be sent to the incorrect person (i.e. the last received SMS) STEPS Receive a lot of SMS messages. Lock your device. Try to answer the last visible SMS received. Unlock your device. Go see in the QKSMS app to view the SMS sent to the incorrect person. This happens on Android Nougat (7.0). Not sure if it happens with the other versions EXPECTED The SMS should be sent to the correct person. OBSERVATIONS The SMS answer is sent to the last SMS received instead of the last visible SMS.

		I really love the app but I just had a tiny little issue while sending pictures via mms. I wanted to send several pictures from my phone storage but the app won't let me select more than one, it would be great if we could send several in one mms. Also I always type the text first and add the pictures right before sending but if you type text in QKSMS the button to add pictures disappears to become the sending button, I think it would be great to have two separate buttons. And one final thing that I miss from an app I previously used (that wasn't as good though), it would be really great if you added a feature to program a sms to send at a given time and date, the option could show in the same button than the one for adding pictures maybe ? Thanks a lot for all your work on this amazing app !

		Just a small feature/improvement suggestion, since I've found this to be a little annoying. If I receive a text notification, and I select the &quot;reply&quot; button from the peek notification to bring up the QR box, the peek notification stays on my screen for a couple more seconds even with the QR box there too. Would it be possible for the peek notification to be dismissed when I tap &quot;reply&quot; to bring up the QR box? Because otherwise it's just redundant to have both, and the peek notification can potentially block or cover up the QR box on smaller devices.

		It doesn't search contact names.

		DESCRIPTION When receiving a message that is part of a group message, I cannot tell who sent that message. STEPS Have someone send a message to several recipients, including you. Enter the group chat and look at the bottom for the latest message. The avatar and name of the sender will not be there. It is up to my imagination to determine which person in the group sent that message. EXPECTED The avatar and name of the sender should appear immediately when the message first is viewed. OBSERVATIONS The avatar and name of the sender do not appear immediately. I am trying to pinpoint what triggers the name and avatar to eventually appear there. It usually take a combination of scrolling the message, or touching the box to enter a reply, or leaving the app and coming back to the message, etc..

		DESCRIPTION I'm not able to build QKSMS using Instant Run. STEPS Fresh clone of QKSMS on the qksms-3.0 branch (commit fbffb37435abfca9a4218f3bc382e3ff744d300a) Build &gt; Clean Run (with Instant Run on) Android studio version: Android Studio 2.2
Build #AI-145.3276617, built on September 15, 2016
JRE: 1.8.0_76-release-b03 x86_64
JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o
 Gradle version 2.2.0 EXPECTED The app builds without fail. OBSERVATIONS I'm getting a lot of &quot;errors&quot; that look like this: warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class
(freemarker.cache.FileTemplateLoader$2) that doesn't come with an
associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a
compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended
solution is to recompile the class from source, using an up-to-date compiler
and without specifying any &quot;-target&quot; type options. The consequence of ignoring
this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
indicate that it is *not* an inner class.
 (They appear as errors in Android Studio.) These are all the errors I'm getting. I think it's printing an error for every class in the freemarker.* package.

		DESCRIPTION If there is so far no recipient entered in a new Message the draft will not get saved. STEPS Hit plus-button. Enter message In case it's relevant: Send message without recipient entered yet. State is now: failed send with error. Send button is a cross now instead of an arrow. (By the way also really confusing because it implies on the first view &quot;cancel&quot; or in that case &quot;delete (message)&quot; even if recipient is entered afterwards. Who dares to touch the &quot;delete message&quot; button to get the send button back!?!) Go back via on-screen back button (the one next to &quot;compose&quot;) EXPECTED Best solution: In the list of send messages one (or more) entries with empty/unknown recipients. But at least hitting the plus button and finding my message again. OBSERVATIONS Message gone. No way to get back to the message.

		Hi, Today, QKSMS crashed, and since this it crashes if I open a conversation with a new SMS received (or when receiving an SMS with the conversation already opened), or when I scroll down/up on the widget. I rebooted the phone multiple times but it persists. Tried to clear the cache of the application. I have no idea why it crashed in the first place, so I don't know how to reproduce it. I'm gonna reinstall it. I copied the /data/data/com.moez.QKSMS directory just in case it could be useful. I use the latest version from F-droid (2.7.3). (Reinstall &quot;corrected&quot; the bug, just lost the custom color for app icon)

		DESCRIPTION I received a SMS caontainig: &quot;18h45-19h&quot; And &quot;45-19&quot; is show as a phone number wich is not the case. The first Idea could be a phone number is always beetween 2 spaces &quot; &quot; (e.g. &quot;Please contact 202-555-0191 around 18h45-19h) Spaces could be replace by linebreak or non litteral chars as &quot;(&quot;, &quot;[&quot; etc... Note that looking for a solution I found this topic; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123559/a-comprehensive-regex-for-phone-number-validation wich make me check https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber I think this could be a valid alternative to the current system: check all list of number and then ask for isPossibleNumber or isValidNumber Ideally people could (in preference) select which country number they want to use (but maybe this is a bit useless) STEPS Send yoursel a SMS containing &quot;18h45-19h&quot; EXPECTED No one number format should be observable (and no clickable action) OBSERVATIONS &quot;45-19&quot; is interpreted as a phone number

		I am using Nova Launcher Prime 4.3.1 and TeslaUnread 5.0.6 on a Samsung Galaxy J7 running Android 6.0.1. I installed QKSMS and set it as the default messaging app, and configured TeslaUnread to display unread message thread counts for it. I am able to receive messages without problems, but the unread thread count never appears on the QKSMS app icon. When I revert to using the Samsung messages app, the unread thread count on its icon works without a problem.

		Hello everybody ! I'm new here on github, and i'm beginning in the beautiful world of the open source world :) I have a proposition for this great app (well done moezbhatti, i love it !). I didn't find a feature that i often use on the stock messaging app : to create a group of contacts to send it some sms. You can already send several people an sms but you cannot save this group of people (with a name, for example &quot;Family&quot; or &quot;Teamwork&quot;) to use it other times. Thank you ! 👍 2

		DESCRIPTION Send SMS using custom protocol STEPS EXPECTED Some provider (Vodafone) offer plans without SMS or costly plans with way too much SMS. QKSMS should send SMS via a different provider (http://www.agiletelecom.com/Documentation.aspx) via custom protocol.

		DESCRIPTION When a message is sent to more than one recipient, it is automatically turned into MMS without notification or confirmation. STEPS Write SMS add at least one more recipient to the list of persons to send the message to send the message EXPECTED The same sms is sent to the designated persons. OBSERVATIONS Message is converted into a MMS without notification or confirmation. Annoying when you want to save data or you don't expect the recipients to spend data. POSSIBLE WORKAROUND If the option that breaks long messages into many SMS instead is checked, make the message long enough to be broke into at least two bits. For example add a lot of spaces followed by a dot. Doesn't seem to work with short messages though. Doesn't work with forwarding or copied MMS either, but likely because of encoding.

		DESCRIPTION It would be great if QKSMS would support the WebSMS API for sending SMS. The development of WebSMS seems to have stopped now, but there are some 'WebSMS connectors' that do their job. Additionally user won't have to switch the app, if they want to send via one that many existing connectors. Additionally one can have only one SMS App allowed to store and receive messages on recent Android, so there's a need for one integrated app. https://github.com/felixb/websms/ WebSMS is GPL3, too. STEPS Install one (or more) of the WebSMS connectors from Play Store or F-Droid. Open QKSMS and try to configure the connector(s). send a message with QKSMS EXPECTED QKSMS provides the necessarry settings ui to configure installed WebSMS connectors and makes it possible to use them for sending SMS. OBSERVATIONS In step 2 you're it's not possible to configure the connector(s). In step 3 the SMS gets send using the OS, but you're not asked if you want to use a connector.

		Sprint is a terrible carrier, and the latest wave of issues affecting certain customers prevents the sending of SMS messages, but not MMS messages, when on connected to LTE.

		Dear developers, When loading images, Google suggests us to cache the bitmaps that can be reused, so as to keep a fluid and fast-loading UI. https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/cache-bitmap.html &quot;...... in order to keep a fluid and fast-loading UI you want to avoid continually processing these images each time they come back on-screen. A memory and disk cache can often help here, allowing components to quickly reload processed images.&quot; However, in the code of QKSMS, bitmap caching is not applied: (1) com.moez.QKSMS.data.Contact.java getAvatar() https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/data/Contact.java#L352 I found getAvatar() is invoked directly by: com.moez.QKSMS.ui.dialog.conversationdetails.ConversationDetailsContactListAdapter.java getView() https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/ui/dialog/conversationdetails/ConversationDetailsContactListAdapter.java#L38 (2) com.moez.QKSMS.common.utils.ImageUtils.java getCircleBitmap() https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/common/utils/ImageUtils.java#L47 I found getCircleBitmap() is invoked by: com.moez.QKSMS.ui.view.AvatarView.java setImageWhenReady() and setImageDrawable() is invoked by: com.moez.QKSMS.ui.view.AvatarView.java setImageDrawable() setImageDrawable() is invoked by: com.moez.QKSMS.ui.dialog.conversationdetails.ConversationDetailsContactListAdapter.java getView() getView() callbacks are frequently invoked in the UI thread and this means that there will be many bitmap objects being created if we not define a cache to store them. For performance considerations, maybe we can define memory cache and disk memory cache to store the bitmap objects. Then app can reuse them instead of creating new bitmap objects continuously. In addition, since image decoding is slow, we can perform these operations in worker threads (e.g., via AsyncTask). Thanks.

		Dear developers, When loading an image, Google suggests us to resize the image before decoding them, so as to save memory resource and avoid OutOfMemory exception. https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/load-bitmap.html &quot; To avoid java.lang.OutOfMemory exceptions, check the dimensions of a bitmap before decoding it, unless you absolutely trust the source to provide you with predictably sized image data that comfortably fits within the available memory &quot; I noticed that in the following code of QKSMS, image resizing is correctly applied: com.moez.QKSMS.common.google.ThumbnailManager.java requestDecode() (line number:) https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/common/google/ThumbnailManager.java#L474 com.moez.QKSMS.ui.view.ComposeView.java doInBackground() (line number: 919) https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/ui/view/ComposeView.java#L919 However, in the code below, images are decoded directly without resizing: (1) com.moez.QKSMS.data.Contact: android.graphics.drawable.Drawable.java getAvatar() (line number: 352) https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/data/Contact.java#L352 (2) com.moez.QKSMS.data.ContactHelper.java getBitmap() (line number: 186) https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/data/ContactHelper.java#L186 I am curious about the latter cases. Why these methods do not resize images? Are these images all of small sizes? Do you think they will affect QKSMS's performance? For the images to be displayed, in many cases, they are larger than required. Because the bitmap display in an app is memory consumption, maybe we should resize the images before decoding them, which can reduce memory overhead and help make app more smooth in user interaction. Thanks.

This only applies if I have the operators number and my sister's number both in the contacts list. If I do not have the operators number in the contact list (which I think is always the case?) it can be simply a option. Add a caution: the text will be permanently removed.

		Feature request Support for &quot;Google Voice&quot; text (SMS/MMS) messaging functionality. Description I (like other people I know) use my &quot;Google Voice&quot; phone number as my primary contact number for calls and text messages. Up until recently, I have been using Google Hangouts as my texting app (SMS/MMS) because it allowed me to send and receive messages BOTH through the text messaging features provided by my carrier (Sprint) AND through the TCP/IP based Google Voice service. (Note: I have my Google Voice number set as the default to send messages from, but the Google Hangouts app allows me to select standard SMS when a new conversation is created.) I really liked having both messaging features in one app! UNFORTUNATELY, Google has decided to remove SMS/MMS functionality from Google Hangouts. To make matters worse, there don't seem to be any other apps that support both SMS/MMS and Google Voice messaging.

		Hi! I noticed that class android.text.format.Time is used in QKSMS at multiple places (I just list some locations I found, may miss some): line 169, 173, 180, etc. in NetworkPolicyManager.java line 865 and 867 in MessageUtils.java This class has been deprecated since API 22 due to multiple reasons (see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/Time.html). Although the class may not cause problems for now, I still think it would be better to use other alternatives to avoid future bugs. 👍 1

		DESCRIPTION Add an option to block all SMS by default, unless they are from someone in address book. OBSERVATIONS SMS spam is a big issue here. Currently there is an option to block numbers, but that still means getting few spam messages in inbox everyday. An ability to block all unknown numbers (combined with the already existing ability to block numbers) would make a completely spam-proof SMS app.

			<description>
		Hi, I love using qksms and have had it as my default SMS client for several months now. However, I noticed that overtime when using it it has become very unresponsive and can sometimes take a long time to switch to the task. Often times this coincides with hitting the back button returning me to the same conversation multiple times as well as other conversations which I might have closed out of or moved away from earlier. I don't know if this is intended Behavior, but there doesn't seem to be a limit to how large the activity stack can be. Regardless of whether or not this is a bug, it seems like a workaround solution can happen if the app has some kind of hard limit to the amount of activities it can generate on that stack. Preferably, I'd like to be able to have the back button always return me to the conversation list if I'm in a conversation thread. Thanks for reading!

		Hi, After trying different SMS apps, I fixed on QKSMS. QKSMS allows for delaying the sending of every SMS throug the parameters. It would be great to have control on the sending time of a given SMS. That possibilty would appear when writing SMS, through an option when pushing the &quot;+&quot; button on the right. The clock that appear would allow to parameter in the same screen for the message being written, the sending time. This new feature allows to program for SMS sending. Thx for reading ! Pierre 👍 1

Offer a User's Manual or Tutorial for Troubleshooting. It shouldn't be so hard to perform such a basic function.

		Hi there, I just found that QKSMS is still using Resources.getDrawable() on line 477 in ThemeManager.java and line 260 in SwipeBackLayout.java. This API has been deprecated since Android 23 and I have found that you have already used ContextCompat.getDrawable() at other locations in QKSMS. I think it's better to replace all the usages of this deprecated API. Thanks!

		When QKSMS is closed by swiping it away in the task manager, it doesn't run in background and is unable to receive any message until opened again. The messages that were not received won't ever be received, even when the app is opened again. (Wiko Ufeel Prime) Open QKSMS From your task manager, swipe the app to one side in order to close it. QKSMS would normally stay open in background and be able to check for new messages. Instead, new messages are never received. I don't know if this is specific to my phone, but I think so because it is quite annoying and more people would be complaining. I have the (bad) habit of &quot;closing&quot; all apps from the task manager, and with QKSMS I miss many messages... The problem was seemingly &quot;solved&quot; by adding hideFromRecents:true to the manifest (by the way, am I allowed to do so, since I don't redistribute the apk ? I do think I won't receive updates though, but anyway I needed to fix this) ; then QKSMS doesn't show in the task manager and hence can't be closed. There are probably other ways of doing this more properly, but I've never actually done any Android programming, so any fix that worked quick was fine for me. I just wanted you to be aware of that. Thanks for reading :) And if I'm not allowed to do this, please tell me, I'll uninstall the apk, delete all files and install the official Google Play app again.

		Changing the icon colour kills QKSMS stone dead and deletes the icon from the launcher. Takes around a second or so for QKSMS to realize it's dead. QKSMS is truly removed from the launcher, there's no active spot with an invisible icon, just a dead space. QKSMS cannot be added back to the launcher unless the icon colour is reset to the default (white) colour first. This occurs using the Nova launcher with QKSMS in the dock. I also tried it with QKSMS on the home page but not in the dock. The first time I tried it outside the dock I got a pop-up telling me it had died and did I want to restart it, but when I tried to restart it nothing happened. The other times I've tried it with QKSMS outside the dock I didn't get that pop-up. Note that I've only tried it outside the dock four times (and got the pop-up once) and tried it in the dock many times and not seen the pop-up. Note that I'm using Jina as my drawer and use it to add QKSMS to the home screen. This may be why nothing seems to happen when I try to add non-white QKSMS to home screen, but is more likely down to Nova itself rejecting the attempt, resulting in Jina failing to confirm that QKSMS has been added to home screen (because it hasn't). May be related to #395 and/or #141. Or not. :) This is on Android 7.1.1. QKSMS 2.7.3 (I signed up for beta last night but playstore hasn't caught up yet). Nova 5.3. Jina 3.0.7ga881

		After installing QKSMS and opening it, I have several conversations that show up where it is the same person I am texting with, but some of the texts show in one conversation and some show in another one. I used SMS Backup and Restore to download the SMS information to XML and I can see where some of the messages show the contact's number in the a variety of formats like: +1 (aaa) bbbcccc +1aaabbbcccc (aaa) bbbcccc I am not 100% sure what caused this. I did install a contact number formatting app that did appear to clean up and standardize my contact's numbers, but that does not seem to have helped this. This seems to have the effect of splitting the conversations with the same person in to multiple threads/conversations within QKSMS. Worth noting, Textra and Google Messages do not exhibit this behavior. They both show all of the messages under one conversation with that contact. Is there something that can be done with QKSMS to have it work in the same way, or perhaps have an option available to &quot;clean up&quot; the text message database to allow it to then display things in this same way? Thank you.

		DESCRIPTION When notification is turned off for some conversations (not blocked ones) the badge counter icon is not shown upon receiving the new messages to that conversations, no other notifications are shown also. So you will never know (till you open the app) that there are new unread messages. Instead of that the unread counter badge is shown for new messages in blocked conversations.

		Hello, First, thank you for your hard work, I switched recently to QKSMS. And it works well, so I'll keep it. I come here (is this the right channel?) because I have a little project to implement on top of QKSMS, but I lost myself a bit in the amount of code here. I hope you could hint me to the right answer? Situation A friend of me can't download nor update new apps on her old phone, and it's not practical for grouped conversation with other friends. So we are limited to SMS, but they don't handle grouped conversation very well either, the single thread for sending and receiving sms don't work. Solutions I aim to get a single threads of grouped messages for each people in our little group. Like sending and receiving messages from/to a mailing list but with SMS. I took a look at SMS gateways (OVH is a little expensive, 0.07€/sms) and the GroupMe app works only in the US :/ So, hey, I thought, I'm relatively used to code, so let's develop it ! Implementation I have a second SIM card for my phone (so, a spare phone number). Basically, a solution can be to send messages to a particular phone number (a sms server phone). It contains a (hardcoded?) list of recipients, their phone numbers and their nickname. This phone checks if the SMS is from a particular list of phone numbers (my friends), and checks if it starts with a specific string, like a 'G'. if that's the case, it lightly reformats the message body (to add a sender nickname). Then it transfers the message to the others people in the group. That's it, no need for dynamic changes for now. The question(s) Supposing everything is well defined until here, my questions to implement it is : Should the code to read and analyze received sms should be in an override of MessagingReceiver.onReceive method or in another place ? Is the HeadlessSmsSendService.onHandleIntent method the right one to call to transfer the SMS to the others recipients ? Thank you for your patience for this very long message :)

		I am unsure if this is actually my device or if there is a problem with QKSMS, but I figured I'll post an issue here just in case there is a bug somewhere in QKSMS causing it. So, a description of what is happening is the application becomes slow and begins to lag after being open (even when switched to from other apps) for a long period of time. Specifically, inputting text becomes very sluggish and navigating around message threads is very sluggish. Usually terminating the app through the Android recent apps screen speeds it back up. It seems like there may be a memory leak somewhere. If I find some time, I'll load a dev version of the app on my phone and see if I can do some profiling. Maybe ADB can help me identify the specific issue. If I diagnose the issue, I'll see if I can put a PR together. Just curious if anybody else is having performance issues. Steps to reproduce: Use QKSMS for an extended period of time Use the app normally Here is some device information App version: 2.7.3 Android version: 7.1.1 Device: Motorola Z2 Force Keyboard app: SwiftKey

		I really like this app, but i have not one small thing about save draft messagers, eg: once you have chosen a contact, then typed your message, and back out off the messaging app. It will save the draft but with no contact , and it cant be seen in main menu. So you have to go back into messaging, draft text is there but again no contact saved, so your having to type the contact again. Could you please look into this issue. Since i regualary use this app. But bit would help if this feature was fixed or added ? Thanks Regards Sob

		Even though I've read (and re-read, just in case) all the texts in QKSMS, the icon in Android has a red circle with 9. Recently 8. It keeps climbing. This is probably due to spam texts that the Should I Answer? app is deleting. Maybe QKSMS it's hiding those texts instead of deleting them? That makes the red number unhelpful. To see what I'm seeing, get a phone number that spammers have, install QKSMS and Should I Answer? apps, link them in the QKSMS settings, and wait for the spammers to send texts.

		Would it be possible to set the type of vibration for the entire app, or per conversation? As an example, AwSMS implements this per-conversation, allowing you to choose between multiple sequences of short and long vibrations for notifications. I can't really find any open source app that does something similar sadly. I'll also take the opportunity to thank you guys for this rather neat app. 👍 2

		I'm trying to use what's become the standard workaround for fixing the hidden layout issue caused by the keyboard in fullscreen mode/themes, &quot;AndroidBug5497Workaround&quot; and am having a really hard time figuring out where to place the class and how to implement it in QKSMS. See it here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7417123/android-how-to-adjust-layout-in-full-screen-mode-when-softkeyboard-is-visible/18249145#18249145 I'm still a beginner, but I've tried pretty blindly a few times, but nothing. Can this work? If so, a guide (for a newbie) or just sharing the relevant files where you successfully implemented it would be extremely helpful, and much appreciated. Compensation could also be arranged :-)

		I'm trying to install QKSMS-v3.0.0-Preview-03.apk from Github, but I get: Parse error
There was a problem parsing the package.
 I have &quot;System Settings &gt; Security &gt; Unknown Sources: checked&quot;. I have tried downloading from the phone and from FF on Linux and nothing works, so I don't think it's APK D/L corruption. I've also tried QKSMS-v3.0.0-Preview-02.apk but I get the same error. FDroid install of 2.7.3 works, but I get the &quot;sending...&quot; forever bug in a group text, so trying v3 per #270. 2.7.3 does seem to eventually send, but it's not really usable. Using MMS settings as per https://www.mintsim.com/setup-for-android/ and thus far no amount of fiddling with settings (2.7.3) has helped so I was really hoping v3 would... Note I'm running Android 4.4.4 on an old Blackphone1 that has NO Google services of any kind (no store, no push, no nothing).

		I noticed when using Preview 6, when using Gboard to select a GIF to send from within a conversation thread already started, QKSMS would open a new message dialog, requiring us to reselect the recipient. Even upon doing so, the GIF is not added to the message (i.e. there is no preview as there is after selecting a photo from system storage.) 👍 1

		Description: When sending images in a text, images previously sent are automatically selected. Steps to reproduce (using latest release): Open a conversation Add an image via the box in the lower-left corner Send the image Send any other text (image or plain text) The previously attached image will also be sent. This applies for as long as you are in the conversation. Once you leave the conversation (press back, exit the app) the image is no longer attached. 👍 1

		I looked for a bug report with the same issue but couldn't find one so I apologize if this is a duplicate. I noticed that if you long press on a conversation a modal pops up but I think the text is white on the white background. If I press in the bottom right corner of the modal, it will delete the conversation so the action is available, you just can't read what's in the modal. Let me know if you need further clarification.

		When halfway through typing a message, and I click the back arrow to return to the conversation list, the message I typed is entirely deleted when returning. Assuming this behaviour is due to the 3.0 rewrite and should be fixed soon, but wanted to bring it to your attention. If I could suggest my view on how it should work: When clicking back, text of draft message is saved and remains in box when returning to specific conversation. Conversation in question moves to the top of the list (or to the point in time when the draft message was last edited, so if a newer message arrives, its conversation goes above the draft's). Text of conversation becomes italicized, or some other method of being able to tell at a glance that this message is a draft. Apologies if this is already known, I'm otherwise loving the update!

		Galaxy Note 4, Android 6.0.1 Upon first launch of the app, it will load and attempt to update the database, but it never does. I've left it for like 20 minutes. So I close the app, attempt to re-open, and get an instant force close/crash. I've tried clearing cache/data, and reinstalling the app, giving the app full permissions before first launch, but it still force closes. logcat_and_device_info.zip

		Hi This is just a suggestion. I downloaded QKSMS, and after I set it as my default messaging app, it automatically sent out a bunch of failed texts from conversations I had backed up. I saw some old conversation threads move up to the top. Some of them were from a few years ago, and ones which I did not want sent out (like to a couple of exes, which I didnt even realize I still had). Already dealing with the fallout from this. I don't know how common this problem is, but there should maybe be a default setting to not send out unsent or failed texts without clicking on retry. Thanks for considering any suggestions

		A feature I find I like in other SMS apps is when texting a number which does not have a contact associated with it, the app provides the ability to quickly add a new contact using this number, basically by sharing the number to the default Contacts app of the system. This would be a nice quality of life feature to add to QKSMS as well. Obviously it is low-priority and the rest of the 3.0 update takes precedence, but it is a nice 'one day' feature to add to the list. 😃 👍 1

		I ran a backup of messages through Titanium Backup, then restored. In the main screen showing a list of conversations, each conversations had a timestamp of the restoration time, rather than the time of the last message in the conversation, which is the typical behavior in QKSMS. The native Android Messaging app correctly shows the time of the last message as the time of the conversation after restoring. Both native TB backup/restore and xml backup/restore produced this issue.

			<description>
		When a phone number is present inside a sent message, QKSMS looks up any existing contacts for that number. If found, the contact name is shown, but it seems the country code is also removed. e.g. It seems that this change is only done on display, the original number is being sent. However, changing how an outgoing message is sent is actually confusing. If it would just add the contact name, that would probably be ok, but now it actually changes the number. It seems that this happens also for foreign numbers, not just for the local country code (I'm in +31, the example above removes +41). This happens both on incoming and outgoing messages.

			<description>
		In ConversationsAdapter.kt, the areContentsTheSame only compares the message id and read status. It doesn't compare any of the contact info, meaning that if a contact sync occurs in the background, it won't update it on the screen until you scroll away and come back

		I'm very much of a pack rat and NEED to be able to keep a record of all past messages but this gets very cluttered obviously. The ability to hide conversations without deleting it's contents is important to me and something this app lacks the ability to do. This is a pretty big QOL improvement and I honestly can't use the app until then. The default Google client allows this with a swipe and I would honestly like to have the same for this app.

		I feel like this is a crucial feature which makes QKSMS stand out among other alternative SMS apps. Not only was this a unique feature that worked slightly differently from other SMS apps that claim to have floating reply windows, but it worked much better and much smoother. Is there any chance you can implement this in QKSMS 3.0? 👍 5

		(Hey moezbhatti, long time no chat!) I'm running on Android 7.0 on an LG G5. Upon attempting to send an MMS message, QKSMS3 crashes. I've also noticed that I haven't received any MMS messages until I restore QKSMS 2.7.3 (or other sms app), and see the messages. They do not show up new, as they are in the message database. Here's an adb logcat of QKSMS from start, creating a new message, attaching an image, and (attempting) sending a message. https://gist.github.com/MyNameIsCosmo/4f2e515a372b456bce8d6f5cd2d66c85 EDIT: This happens on beta 5, 4, and 3 as I've tested.

		DESCRIPTION When you input data into the edit text field and then you decide to go back to parent view, you click on back arrow inside the toolbar (top right corner). However, the child to parent redirection animation is faster then the hide keyboard animation, therefore you have this behavior: As you can see even when the parent view is already displayed the keyboard is still visible for less than a second. STEPS TO REPRODUCE Open conversation view Tap search icon Tap the edit text field (if keyboard is not visible) Click the back arrow to go back to the previous view NOTE I have also observed this behavior in other views that have child-parent redirection, so i think it would be nice to deal with this issue to have better animation and user experience. I have an idea how to fix this, so i would also like to claim this issue. Will provide you with a pull request soon.

		Hello my name is Richard Caseres I am a graphic designer and I like to make contributions for open source projects from the graphic and advertising point of view. in this opportunity I contact you to propose a new icon and a logo more personalized and more current for your application in development this in order to give a better image to your project. I develop within the platform Utopian.io with blockchain of steemit, the rewards I receive from them however they require me to contact the developer of the project so that they can verify that my logo proposal will be used in the project and so do not compensate contributions that will not be used in the projects. Here I show you a model of the proposal of the logo if it is of tua degree I can provide you all the necessary files within a contribution in GitHub to be added to your project. So that within Utopian-io my contribution to your project is valid you must place on the main page of the project on GitHub an application for a new logo or icon as a contribution to your project to simply demonstrate that you will use the new icon and the new logo. Well I hope you like my proposal, thank you very much for your time to read this and I hope we are in contact. Greetings. 😕 1

		If I do not make it back in time for lunch, please practice pipetting. I will also send you a list of problems for the dilution formula. Do not stress if you do not get it, as I have had to delay the study guide in order to figure out normality. 

The formula is as follows:
C1 • V1 = C2 • V2

Where:
C1 stands for the molar concentration of the first solution
V1 stands for the volume, in the unit liters, of the first solution
C2 is the concentration of the diluted solution 
V2 stands for the volume of the diluted solution

 This fails to copy in qksms V3 B7 but copies without a problem in the default Messenger.

		Hi moezbhatti I'm using QKSMS 3.0 for a while now, and hereby I would like to write down my concerns, suggestions: Missing: avatar in notifications: I really would like to see who send me a message in a glimp (I see this is already on the to-do-list) Suggestions: please include the translations (I translated Dutch already) make the font inside the text-bubbles a little bit bigger, it's really small now Reconsider the colors in the dark theme. On my OnePlus 5t I can't see a difference between the dark background and the text-bubbles maybe some new icon so it looks more like the previous one (see below) On the conversationlist: maybe make the 'search'-bar like the themecolor? It looks so bright now don't show only emojis-messages inside a textbubble always show the timestamp of the latest message Bugs Color from avatar doesn't change to theme you set for that contact in the conversationlit (already reported) With the new QK reply: when you send a message with another app (Join) it doesn't show up in the QK reply window but it is visible in the app the automatic dark mode doesn't work on my OnePlus 5T Hope it is some constructive feedback ;) Many, many thanks for this app and that you listen to the community (something Pulse doesn't). Kind regards Jari

		Using the latest QKSMS3 Beta 8. I received a message, read it, and any message afterwards would display as the &quot;first&quot; message in my notifications. This did not happen I'm beta 7. I won't be by a computer for the next day or so, so I cannot debug the issue fully. EX: Received message: &quot;First Message&quot; Notification: &quot;First Message&quot; Respond to message Receive another message: &quot;Second Message&quot; Notification: &quot;First Message&quot; It may also be worth noting that notifications are displayed even though qksms is open in the same chat the message was received.

		When you reply to a message that is on 2nd (or below) place in the conversationlist, and you go back to the conversation list, the message goes to the top of the list but the view doesn't. So you don't see the thread you just replied to. It would be nice if the thread is shown as first (so that the menu would scroll to the top). Pfoe, difficult to explain 😅

		This is something I've experienced with both 3.0 and the old versions of QKSMS, and I'm honestly unsure whether it's on my end or a problem with the app. About 20% of the time, the app won't &quot;wake&quot; the phone and give me a sound/vibration. I only realize a new message is received once I open the app and see the message. When I used the old QKSMS I even converted it to a system app but it would still &quot;ignore&quot; about 5-10% of messages and wouldn't give a notification at all. I've pondered whether the app is underprivileged and could use 1 or 2 more permissions to successfully wake the phone 100% of the time. My phone is rooted and I'm sure that it has all the requested permissions. I haven't experienced this issue with neither the stock SMS app nor Textra, which makes me think it might be an issue with QKSMS. Is this something anyone else has experienced? I'd be happy to debug it if someone tells me how to do it. I've got CatLog installed but it seems hard to reproduce/test.

		I am using QKSMS 2.7.3 on Fairphone Open with XPrivacy and AFWall+ on a Fairphone 2. The app cannot receive any MMS (sending only when enabling some foreign apps in AFWall+ and disabling WLAN, for some reason) and seems to create a wake lock as well, thus draining my battery very fast. Is that a bug or did I do anything wrong? Fairphone forum thread incoming MMS: https://forum.fairphone.com/t/qksms-and-incoming-mms/39178?u=hansibert Fairphone forum post wakelock: https://forum.fairphone.com/t/another-hot-fp2-with-empty-battery/39245/5?u=hansibert

		Device: OnePlus 2 A2001 Version: 7.1.2 QKSMS: 3.0.3. Search inbox... -&gt; Type 'Joe Bloggs' = Returns a result Use the backspace key on the Android keyboard to delete the name 'Joe Bloggs' then returns all received messages. Search inbox... -&gt; Type 'Joe Bloggs' = Returns a result Press the X button (to the right) to delete name does not return any received messages. Inconsistent and should display the same when using both of the above methods. 👍 1

		This is using version 3.03 though the same problems exist with the version at the play store. Messages are not being marked as read. I get notifications, then go to the page and read the message but they are still not marked as read. I use another app called professional reminder. If I send a text to myself, and read it in qksms it still shows Quick Stop (C:0 S:1 M:0) Stop all current reminders C,S,M mean phone Calls, Sms, and Mms. I have the reminder set for every 20 minutes so it is beeping every 20 minutes which is very annoying. I don't know if this is relevant but I have QK reply turned off since I don't like it.

		In the old QKSMS there used to be a setting for turning off dismissing the popup window (QK Reply) when you tapped outside of it. Currently, the window will always close/dismiss whenever you tap outside of the window, which can sometimes close down the window by accident. Would you consider adding this setting in 3.0 as well?

		I try to explain what I call &quot;generic search&quot; (I don't know how to name it). When searching for contacts or words either in the welcome screen or in the &quot;new conversation&quot; screen (after pressing &quot;+&quot; button), when typing standard ascii characters, I would expect that the search result will also include the same characters with diacritics: when typing c, I would also expect to see ç included same thing with e which should include é, ê, ę, etc a --&gt; à, ą l --&gt; ł r --&gt; ř and so on (and my list of correspondences above is not exhaustive). Instead, it is necessary to type the exact characters with diacritics, otherwise the contacts / words are not found. Observed on Qksms 3.0.5. Not sure that Qksms 2.7.3 was behaving the same. 👍 1

		Hi there, I installed QKSMS through F-Driod and in last update I got QKSMS+. Everything looks and works fine but that a feature that I really miss is selecting multiple conversation which was available in QKSMS. Hope to see this feature back as I am sure it is useful for many of us. Cheers! 👍 1 ❤️ 1

		Hello! Great app, really love it! I have a few suggestion to make it even better: Option to delete multiple messages at once. When selecting QK Reply, the heads-up should not show up as well. When selecting QK Reply, should be an option to make it appear from pressing the heads-up notification, not automatically, so that you dont have to enter the application. Selecting the colour of a conversation should change the bubble with the letter as well. (Optional, but eager to see) Option to set different patterns of vibration (maybe for different contacts). A wake-up screen option (for phones that dont have such a feature). Thank you for your work and soon I'll buy + edition, but I really hope that at least 1,2,3 will be part of the app.

		DESCRIPTION This issue is about a bug on your application, and its making you lose chances of being appreciated for your wonderful work. Your application is wonderful and very useful, but there is a problem with the version on F-driod. When i tried to make a donation or upgrade to &quot;lifetime upgrade&quot;, i got a Google Error message, which completely hindered me from making the donation, and upgrading. I discovered that a similar issue was raised 2 years ago, but was later closed. I assume that it was closed because the issue had been resolved. But, i'm bringing it to your notice that the error still occurs on F-driod version. I tried out the version on Google Play, and its working very fine, and i got no error message. Please Note The Following: The version on Google Play Store is still on 2.7.3 after the update. F-driod can't use Google in-app billing. Please dump the version in Google Play Store and place some alternative for F-driod version. STEPS Download QKSMS from F-droid Launch the application Click on menu on the top left of the application Go to &quot;QKSMS+&quot; Click on &quot;donate+unlock&quot;, a google error message comes up. Click on &quot;life time upgrade&quot;, a google error message also comes up. EXPECTED I expect that clicking on &quot;donate&quot; or &quot;life time upgrade&quot; will bring up a means of payment to support the developer for his great work or upgrade to a higher level. OBSERVATIONS Clicking on &quot;Donate&quot; and/or &quot;life time upgrade&quot; brings up a google error message. https://youtu.be/jTZFCKA4c6A This bug report can also be found on utopian-io 👍 5 ❤️ 1

		This is the only app I have that doesn't have an About section. I was wondering if we should have it implemented into QKSMS. It could be something like: QKSMS Build 3.0.8 Developer Moez Bhatti Source code https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms Changelog https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/releases Contact team@qklabs.com License GNU General Public License v3.0 Copyright © 2014 - 2018 You could also add a link for donations. A lot (not all) of FOSS apps seem to also add a list of the libraries they use too, I don't know if you would actually want to do that. It should be a pop up scrollable menu or a submenu. 👍 2

		DESCRIPTION Hello, I upgraded the application to 3.0.7 on my phone, I was at the screen in version 2.7.3. On the old version, it was possible to change both the color of the circles representing the different contacts as well as the color of the top space in contact with the status bar. On this new version, it is apparently only possible to change the color of the circles representing the contacts. Has the one to change the &quot;top&quot; color of the application been implemented or is it not yet available? EXPECTED No option to change the status bar color OBSERVATIONS There is no option to changing the &quot;top&quot; color of the app. Thanks in advance.

		Seems to be a permission issue with most gallery apps, as they have no reason to reasonably request permission to view MMS content. I'll have to implement a video player within QKSMS to get around this. Will put it on the roadmap

		I got a message from my operator about missed calls but in that message just before the phone numbers were listed, there were the contact names written just as I've got them saved on my phone. Like this: You got a missed call from contact name phone number So is this QK grabbing info of that number and putting it in the message for ease of use or is my operator somehow lurking in my contacts list?

		Currently, the app will automatically try to send the message as a group message, rather than allowing you to send it individually as an SMS to each recipient. This will require quite a bit of design work/thinking, as the current design doesn't accommodate for this behavior.

		DESCRIPTION After the latest update (3.1.2) and using the SwiftKey app, when you double tap space to add a period, it will delete the last letter of the word and add the period and space. STEPS Every time you double tap space. EXAMPLE If I type &quot;Hello&quot; and double tap space it will result in &quot;Hell. &quot; I am using SwiftKey to reproduce this issue which only occurs while using QKSMS. If I switch to the LG Keyboard the double tap space doesn't add a space after the period at all. QKSMS Version: 3.1.2 Device: LG V30+ OS: 7.1.2 Android

		Started using 3.1.3, and for some reason almost all messages show up twice. I jumped from 3.0.9 to 3.1.3 so it could have happened anywhere between those updates. Anyone else experiencing this? I attached some screenshots; if you are able to see any sort of pattern or reason for this, it's beyond me. And just to be clear: the messages are only displayed twice, they are not sent twice. Using Android Nougat 7.0.

		DESCRIPTION Archived messages return to the inbox if QKSMS is not the default application. STEPS Install QKSMS. Launch application, skip making QKSMS the default SMS application. Wait until database is optimized (I had to restart the application a few times for it to complete). Archive some conversations. Exit (via back button) and reopen the application, skip the prompt making QKSMS the default again. Alternate steps where QKSMS is already used as the default: Archive some conversations, if not already. Install / set another application as the default for SMS and exit. Reopen QKSMS, skip making it the default application. EXPECTED Previously archived conversations should remain archived, but instead they are all visible in the inbox list and the archived list remains empty. Tested on current latest F-Droid build, 3.1.1. Not ready to make it my daily driver for SMS just yet, but glad to hear it's back in development!

		A lot of users email explaining that MMS doesn't work, and it's generally because they set the &quot;Max MMS attachment size&quot; to &quot;No limit&quot;.

		DESCRIPTION When composing a new message, the conversation has to be found by backspacing the input. STEPS Hit the &quot;+&quot; Floating Action Button. Type a few letters of the name of the contact. When you select the contact, the name appears at the top. However, the letters you typed while searching are still there. In order to access the message field, you have to backspace. EXPECTED When a name is selected, the message history should immediately appear without backspacing. OBSERVATIONS Instead of the conversation appearing, you have to backspace the name if you partially typed it to view the conversation history.

		I'm having an issue with using this on Android 8.0 Oreo. When I start up the app, it offers the permissions and such to grant/set as default (which I accept) and then it begins &quot;Syncing Messages.&quot; It gets stuck here, though, and doesn't progress--even after several minutes. If it makes any difference, I'm on a Moto Z Play, unrooted, recently updated to Oreo, and also have a Substratum theme activated. The issue occurs on a fresh installation of the app (clear data + uninstall + reinstall) from F-Droid. A thing of note: I had the app set up and configured in the past, many versions ago, but left it for a while as MMS didn't really work for me. I'm trying to give it another go. Steps to Reproduce: Clear data and reinstall the app. Open app, grant permissions, watch as &quot;Syncing messages&quot; appears Enjoy the heat death of the universe Expected Result: Messages would sync, preferably with a progress bar of some sort, and then everything would work with absolutely no bugs. Actual Result: Stuck on &quot;Syncing messages&quot; at the main menu. Here's some more info: Version: 3.2.0 (F-Droid_ Device: motorola XT1635-02 (Moto Z Play, US) SDK: 26 (?) Carrier: T-Mobile

		DESCRIPTION When I'm not on data, occasionally someone will send me an image via MMS. Not being on data, I obviously can't see it, but I'm not notified that an image was even sent. In the default LG messaging app, I do get notified, so I know to turn on data and download it. STEPS Disable mobile data Be sent an image via MMS EXPECTED A placeholder message tells you there is an image you can download. OBSERVATIONS I never know that I've been sent an image, unless they ask about it. 👍 1

		DESCRIPTION QKSMS crashes on startup. First reported by Daniel Reardon on Google Communities, here, confirmed by at least one other. Around that time other Google Communities posters were reporting issues with posts not being seen by all users, which is why there may have been no response. STEPS 1 Fire up QKSMS EXPECTED QKSMS starts and works normally. OBSERVATIONS A blank window opens, then vanishes. A system message appears &quot;Unfortunately, QKSMS has stopped.&quot; I've used the &quot;Send feedback&quot; option on the system message twice. I have no idea if it goes to the developer or Google or is silently discarded, but there are no signs it is being dealt with. Android 7.1.2, QKSMS 3,2,2 (from App info, not from the app itself, because the app doesn't start).

		DESCRIPTION When using the light theme, the navigation bar icons on my Huawei Nova 2i (Mate 10 Lite) running 8.0 Oreo become invisible. I've switched back to the default EMUI Explorer theme and uninstalled Navbar Apps, thinking one of them was the cause of the bug. Still the same thing. No problem with the dark mode, however. I'm using the latest v3.3.0, but I also noticed this on v3.2.2. STEPS Open QKSMS Disable dark mode (if it's on) EXPECTED The nav bar icons should be visible at all times. OBSERVATIONS The nav bar icons are invisible and the nav bar itself is black.

		It appears that QKSMS does not directly use the default android SMS database. I would like to understand more about how it works and what to expect, from the user perspective. Currently I am testing QKSMS, and do not have it set as my default sms app. I'm just trying to compare it to my default app. When I receive a new sms, it appears in my default app, but does not appear in QKSMS unless I manually re-sync messages. If I delete a message in QKSMS, it is not deleted in my default SMS app. If I delete a message in the default app, it is not deleted in QKSMS unless I manually re-sync messages. The databases do not appear to sync automatically. The manual re-sync appears to be a one-way sync from the default db to QKSMS. Is this correct? It's not clear if/how this would change if I did set QKSMS as my default app. It's also not clear what would happen if I use QKSMS for a while and later decide to switch to a different sms app. Would I loose messages that were received while QKSMS was the default app, or are they somehow copied to the default database? Overall this does not seem very transparent or friendly for new users. Putting some explanation into the wiki would be a good start.

		QKSMS just shows the time, when the SMS was received on my phone. Example: Phone gets switched off (or loses reception) at 1:00 and will be on the network again at 9:00. Someone sends a message at 2:00. Phone will display 9:00, and there is no way to figure out when the message really was sent. This is sometimes annoying e.g. if you are travelling and do not have full coverige all the time. Then you won't know if messages like &quot;I'm there now&quot; still are current or already old. STEPS Switch off phone Send a message from another phone to the phone number you switched off Wait for 5 minutes Switch the phone on again. For the message you'll only see the time when the phone was switched on, not the time when the message was sent. EXPECTED It would be nice to have the option: &quot;display sent/network time&quot;, or there is even enough space to display both times, if different. 👍 2

		The common Android buttons throughout most apps (triangle pointing down or left, circle, and square) are not rendered appropriately in QKSMS+, built by F-Droid. If you press where they should be, they function appropriately. If you look very closely, you can barely see the outlines of the buttons, so they are not totally invisible to the keen observer. No fancy steps to reproduce this issue. It occurs globally throughout QKSMS+. Thanks! 👍 1

		DESCRIPTION ShortcutBadger number do not update after sync message STEPS receive a new message, and there will be a badge number '1' on the QKSMS app icon mark this message as &quot;READ&quot; using another messageing app rather than QKSMS return to QKSMS, select 'sync message' EXPECTED After sync , the message should be shown as read, and the badge number should be updated with message list. OBSERVATIONS the message is automatically marked as read, but there is still a badge number '1' on QKSMS icon. ###Auto-sync feature I used AOSP Messaging app in the past, it will automatically sync messages in background once it is launched. I wonder if you'd like to add this feature to QKSMS. 👍 1

		DESCRIPTION I had a strange bug with QKSMS when trying to receive the verification code for turning on 2FA in my bit.ly account. After requesting the code, I didn't get any notification. A second time - still nothing. I even tried a third time the next day but still nothing. It was only after opening Android Messages and Pulse did I notice the phone numbers containing the verification codes, but they didn't show up in QKSMS. Huawei Nova 2i (Mate 10 Lite), 8.0 Oreo STEPS Request for a 2FA verification code Check if the code appears in QKSMS EXPECTED The 2FA verification code should appear in QKSMS, like it does in other SMS apps. OBSERVATIONS The verification code doesn't show up in QKSMS for some reason. 👍 1
