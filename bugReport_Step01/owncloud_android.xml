		While testing the behaviour of down- and uploads with a single file File.txt for editing, I now noticed a spooky file File_conflict_20121030_084503.txt on the Android. I use server 4.5.1a Android 1.3.14 Jota Text Editor (Android) with enabled setting to use abackup version when editing. This editor creates a backup file with filename File.txt~ . Perhaps this backup file (renaming, swapping names of current and backup version ???) is causing the reported issue. In previous tests I disabled the backup file creation in the Jota Text Editor settings and everything (editing on the server, editing in Windows client and editing on the Android device) appeared to work fine, at least I did not notice problems when synchronising the Android client manually - for this see bartoszprzybylski/owncloud-android#43 ) The Delete button however only offers to the delete this particular file on the server(!). The Windows client does not show such a file in the file list. Questions: Please can you explain why the Android client offers &quot;delete on the server&quot; ? Should the text become &quot;delete locally&quot; because there is no File_conflict_TIMESTAMP.txt on the server but a conflicting backup file File.txt~ locally ? [UPDATE] I think I was wrong. The file is indeed on the server. This exact local file name (File.txt~) should be listed locally in the Android client, or File.txt~___conflict_TIMESTAMP [UPDATE] I think I was wrong. The file is indeed on the server.

		Connecting to SSL secured hosts that require SNI (Server Name Indication) support is currently not possible without accepting all certificates, which is of course undesirable. It would be nice if the owncloud Android client would properly support SNI so hostname based TLS negotiation can be performed, thus securing a valid trust chain and communication. I've done some research and found a couple of resources indicating that SNI is possible on Android. http://source-android.frandroid.com/libcore/luni/src/main/java/libcore/net/http/HttpsURLConnectionImpl.java http://source-android.frandroid.com/libcore/luni/src/main/java/libcore/net/http/HttpConnection.java http://source-android.frandroid.com/libcore/luni/src/main/java/org/apache/harmony/xnet/provider/jsse/OpenSSLSocketImpl.java There is an setHostname() method in OpenSSLSocketImpl that if called causes NativeCrypto.SSL_set_tlsext_host_name() to be called. That in turn calls SSL_set_tlsext_host_name(). Hopefully, this is helpful.

		In spite of what the OC desktop clients do, it would be nice to have a &quot;Keep directory up to date&quot; option for directories, as well as it is available for files now. The typical use case is a &quot;magic folder&quot; that is always in sync between your desktop, OC and your phone (so that you can work on the files also when you're offline, and as soon as you get back online, your changes are propagated). Another use case is a Music folder to be kept in sync (streaming is not very reliable, and definitely doesn't work when you're offline :-) ) It shouldn't be too hard to implement, as the file synchronizer already seems to be able to handle directories (am I wrong?), and so the only step is to add a long-press feature to directories to enable the synching option. Another design issue is where to store the data. I believe the user should be able to choose where to mirror the OC directory locally (and the default &quot;/sdcard/owncloud&quot; is used for single-file sync). Finally, like the desktop clients should do, the first sync should support a &quot;merge&quot; strategy. The use case here is: I have my files already stored on owncloud, and I also copied them to the phone via USB (because it's quicker and cheaper than using my 3G dataplan). I'm a good Java developer, but new to Android. I'm willing to provide some programming help and all the necessary testing if you're keen on adding this feature.

		The android client will try to fetch status.php from the user-provided URL on account creation. If this fails with a 401 HTTP status (Unauthorized), it will show &quot;Unknown error occurred!&quot;. I gave the client the username and password, it should be able to use them and so would be able to fetch status.php and continue. For the situation when there are no or wrong credentials entered, it should show an approriate error message.

		Every now and then after entering the apps security PIN I don't get to my owncloud root directory but get the configuration site where I should enter the URL and access details of my ownclod account. This is quite annoying as entering URLs and passwords with special characters on the mobile keyboard is rather unhandy. Also after successfully reentering the account data it looks like the app does a full rescan of the file database which can take a while and eat a lot of battery depending on the size of the data in your owncloud. The version of my app is 1.3.14

		I have a folder in my owncloud account that contains several 100 GBs of video files. As I quite surely never will need them on my mobile phone and they make the indexing of the whole folder structure a quite lengthy process it would be nice to tell the app to exclude some folders from syncing or indexing. This could maybe be achieved similar to the way which k9mail goes: there one can set folders as main folders that are automatically synced with every sync process and other folders, where only the folder structure itself is indexed. If you enter one of the latter folders theres a button that lets one load the content of the folder if needed. By this one could restrict the folders that one needs to be synced or indexed on the mobile phone and therefore keep syncing/indexing times short and battery saving.

		There are two very good open-source apps to sync calendars and contacts on android via caldav/carddav, both developed by Marten Gajda (http://dmfs.org/). According to Twitter he is currently working on an extension to sync tasks via caldav as well (caldav-todo app, http://code.google.com/p/caldavtodo/) and is looking for programmers to help him. Maybe this would be a good chance to collaborate and push the integration of calendar/contact/tasks syncing into the owncloud android app? Best, PR

		Just got a new Nexus 4. On the website my WebDAV URL is: http://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/ so this is what I tried to use in the client. It says &quot;Testing connection...&quot; and the text quickly disappears but the Connect button is simply greyed out. This is confusing, it would be nice if it threw a red error message saying &quot;Unable to connect - please make sure to use the same URL as you use to access your web interface&quot; or something like that, otherwise we are left with no idea ... trial and error. I think some people are giving up at that point and giving the app bad reviews on the store, &quot;doesn't work&quot; since they don't figure it out and give up. Optimally the app would detect if they are using the WebDAV link as on their website and if so, automatically retry the correct URL stripping off the additional &quot;/remote.php/webdav/&quot; part but a simple error message would also fix it for 99% of the people too impatient to figure it out.

		It could be even one way but I don't see a way to sync folders? Would be nice to have just a checkbox to download an entire folder. Not sure about two way syncs on this app since it could cause some outrageous bandwidth fees over 4G, so I guess this couldn't be done without the option to have owncloud only sync when on wifi. Otherwise you do it manually like it is now. I have a user case which applies I think to a lot of users soon - I am trying to break free from iTunes. iTunes library has a folder hierarchy even for a single song e.g. /artist/album_name/song_name/song.mp4 ... so to try and sync over 1000 songs would take an incredibly long time. But could apply to anything, &quot;Documents&quot; folder etc.

		Hi :) I installed the current version of the app on Android Jelly Beans (Asus tf201) .Everything works fine. But I changed the server-address (subdir to a subdomain), so I removed the account settings from the app. After that everything works fine too (other wedav clients and so on) but only the owncloud app doesn't work. The app can't connect to the new and the old server address. I get an unknown error. I reinstalled the app many times (deleted the syncfiles on android too) but every time the same error... As I said every other tool has no problems with the new OR the old settings. What's wrong? Is it a serverside problem? Greetings Edit: I use ownCloud 4.5.3 (current version) Edit2: Same problem in ownCloud 4.5.4

		As the title says. This is especially bad because scrolling seems not possible, and the logo and password field is cut off and the connect button is not visible at all. Quick fix would be to enable scrolling on that screen, real fix would be to optimize the layout for when the keyboard is shown, to show all elements above the keyboard (possible at least on a tablet).

		The »successfully downloaded« notification in the top bar / notification area doesn’t do anything on click, just vanishes. Rather I expect it to go to the file detail view so I can check it out. Is that a pattern on Android though? I’m just testing on 2.2 so it’s probably skewed.

		There are multiple problems with the top bar menu which are all kind of related: When you start the app or are in the base folder of your ownCloud, the top bar menu shows a slash. This is not understood by most people as »root folder«, except maybe Linux users. Especially here it seems the slash and dropdown doesn’t need to be there at all, because clicking the slash only exposes a menu with the slash being the only entry. When you’re in the root folder, the menu should simply not be there. This brings up a general issue – the dropdown always also shows the current folder as first entry, which doesn’t make sense because you’re already in it and clicking it does nothing anyway. Then when you are in a sub-subfolder we of course need to label the base folder as something in the dropdown. Here we should put the username of the current user When you open a file then, suddenly the top bar says »ownCloud« and it’s not possible to get to the dropdown anymore. Instead of »ownCloud«, it should display the name of the file, as well as enable the path dropdown. cc @davivel (btw who else is working on the app?) UPDATE - pending tasks: remove the dropdown menu prevent the »ownCloud« title seems tappable (changes background color) in the root folder

		Sometimes I still get this account setup popup: »Setup Account There are no ownCloud accounts on your device. In order to use this App, you need to create one« With 2 buttons »OK« and »Leave ownCloud«. Now this popup is unnecessary (especially the »Leave ownCloud« button ;). It should not even be there, but instead when it’s the case that there are no ownCloud accounts, the account setup screen with input fields etc should just be shown.

		I may have figured out an issue I was having with IU failing - it doesn't handle switching 3G/WiFi mid-upload well. OK, I can deal with that. But in discovering this I realized there wasn't a way to re-initiate an InstantUpload (act as if a photo has just been taken and sync it), which would be useful if it fails for this (or any other) reason.

		On my HUAWEI Y200, ownCloud resides in the (very small) internal telephone memory. I noticed once more again, that synchronisation does not work any more. When I click &quot;Aktualisieren&quot;, nothing happens. I suppose it has to do with the fact, that on my device only +/- 20 MB RAM are available. However, ownCloud should not silently fail to synchronise on low RAM but should show a suitable message &quot;cannot synchronise because of low RAM&quot; (if this is really the reason. I do not know.)

		When downloading music files with the owncloud client, they aren't found in the media player until you plug the phone to a computer (using it as usb memory stick). The reason is that when the phone is removed from the computer, the &quot;Media Provider&quot; Update event is triggered. This event recognizes changes in the file system and rebuilds the index which then is used by the media player. This event should also be triggered, when music files were downloaded. I didn't test it, but the same could apply for pictures and the android gallery app.

		If I try to upload a photo from my photo gallery on an Android phone to an empty folder on the server, the ownCloud app wouldn't enter the folder when I click on it. Steps to reproduce: Create an empty folder on the ownCloud server Go to the Gallery app on an Android phone Select a photo and choose to share it via ownCloud Try to enter an empty folder to upload to it Result: you can't enter into an empty folder, hence you can't upload to it. This happens with ownCloud app v 1.3.17.

		I'm using two owncloud servers, one for business and one privately. Both are synced to my mobile phone. I'd like to use instant upload to upload my photos to the private cloud and not to the business cloud. But if I activate the setting and I was logged in to the business cloud before, they of course are uploaded there. So I'd like to have a setting &quot;upload to&quot; for instant upload. At least it should select the server, if possible it would also be nice to select the folder to upload to.

		As I need some files to be up2date on my phone, I marked them as &quot;keep file up to date&quot;. The problem is, that this options does not trigger any background sync as I would expect. To automatically update this files I have to open owncloud, insert my PIN and wait for a refresh. So, this option does only keep files up to date after I did some steps manually, every single time. If I need the new version while out of signal, I'm lost.

		Hi, I think many people who wish their owncloud Android app be able to sync contacts (with caldav) and calendar (with carddav) with their ownlcoud instance without having to pay for apps such as: for contacts: Caldav-sync which costs 2,55 euro
or Acal Caldav which costs 1,49 euro
or Andal, whose unlock key costs 2,76 euro
 for calendar events: Cardav-sync beta which costs 1,89 euro
 I have searched github for a silimar request but couldn't find it. I hope this is not a double! Thanks in advance!!!

		I have set up an owncloud account with quite some data and folder structure in it. Obviously, syncing that would take some time so it isn't strange that not everything is visible at my phone right at once. But it seems that the client is trying to sync everything from A-Z and in that order, while I'd think that syncing that what I need the most would be preferable. And what I need the most, are these items that I'm actually looking for. So if I browse into a folder &quot;Work&quot;, it can be assumed that I want to see its contents, so syncing the rest should be stopped and the contents of the Work-folder should be shown. This way, by prioritizing the syncing, the user experience is way more natural, since you don't notice that some folders haven't been synced yet (as you haven't watched in them yet). When you compare owncloud to dropbox (which works this way), there is a significant difference in the time it takes to show a directory. Actually, thinking about it. On the android client, which behaves a lot like the dropbox client on android right?, the server is 'always right', why would syncing a file list then take so long anyway?

		I believe the current version of the Android app 1.3.20 can not handle uploading files of any size using the owncloud app when running on Android 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. Tested on a fresh Android 4.2.2 code base on a Samsung Galaxy Nexus with factory images &quot;yakju&quot; for Galaxy Nexus &quot;maguro&quot; (GSM/HSPA+) from https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#yakjujdq39 Uploading files, and the instantupload of pictures fails at different percentages. Even small textfiles fail during the upload. Looking into tail /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log on the owncloud server I see: [Tue Feb 26 13:46:20 2013] [error] [client 192.168.0.1] PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 523800 bytes) in /var/www/html/owncloud/lib/db.php on line 562 adding more fysical RAM or changing the php max memory allocation sed -i 's/memory_limit = 500M/memory_limit = 768M/' /etc/php.ini does not seem to help.

		I have been interested in owncloud since a few months specially due to its open source android app and that anyone can customize it according to their needs. I am still new to java and programming but have been playing around with the app code to do bit by bit modifications to suit my personal needs. I wanted to change the default owncloud folder location and folder name used by the app to learn more and suit my needs. I have tried to analogize the code and a few java files related to file operations in &quot;src&quot; but wasnt unable to find any hint related to change the folder. Can someone please point me to the file/part of code by which I can modify the name of the folder on localdisk on phone from &quot;owncloud&quot; to something like maybe &quot;cloud&quot; or &quot;instant backup&quot; etc. and secondly change it from / location to something like /folder/folder2/cloud Any help will be appreciated

		If I use .htaccess to identify users in owncloud i can't connect to the server with android. Because the popup access window from the web server pops up before it reaches owncloud. This leads to the problem that the connect button keeps unclickable.

		My server is accessible only from inside my home network. When I take pictures outside the network, Instant Upload attempts at uploading but fails, as expected. At the end of the day when I get back home, I expect the pictures to finally be uploaded, but they don't.

		Hi, I use the owncloud android app and the &quot;instant upload&quot; feature. I think this feature is very cool but I have some problems with it (I've a SGS 3 + Cyanogen 9.1) : First, it seems that it only syncs the photos taken after the option is activated. It would be nice if it could sync all the photos taken by the camera available. Second, I store my photos on a external SD card (mounted as /mnt/extSdCard). When I sync my photos using InstantUpload, the app copy all my photos on the server (that's normal) but also on /mnt/sdCard/Owncloud/... (just as the app does when it downloads a local copy of a file on the server). So all my photos are stored twice on the system. Thanks

		I set up my ownCloud at home, and immediately went to get the Android app. It took me about 30 minutes of picture taking to figure out the procedure for getting instant upload to work, and I wanted to suggest that the method by which I had to do it, was perhaps not as obvious as it should be. Here is how I did it: Create the InstantUpload folder via the web interface in the root &quot;/&quot; of my ownCloud account. Upload a picture to the InstantUpload folder via the web interface. Test a manual upload from my Note to the InstantUpload folder (if you hadn't completed steps 1 and 2, it would fail telling you that the first time you had to be online, which is unfortunately not as clear as it needs to be). Take a picture, and look at your notification shade to see it now uploading automatically. My suggestion is not to have the instructions come up as a toast notification, but as a true notification that sits in the notification shade. I had to take a few pictures in a row to be able to even read the whole message. At that, tapping the notification should bring you to a step by step instructional page outlining how to enable Instant Upload properly. Now, it is very possible that what I had to do was not the standard way people are getting instant upload to work, but it worked for me - so even if it sits here in the GitHub for someone else to find, so be it. Thank you for reading. Jay

		If you store a lot directories (300 including subdirectories is sufficient), then any sync of the Android client will keep your webserver busy for a few minutes. The apache log shows approximately the following: x.x.x.x - tom [13/Apr/2013:10:54:17 +0200] &quot;PROPFIND /remote.php/webdav/articles/A/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 207 1425 x.x.x.x - tom [13/Apr/2013:10:54:17 +0200] &quot;PROPFIND /remote.php/webdav/articles/B/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 207 1360 x.x.x.x - tom [13/Apr/2013:10:54:18 +0200] &quot;PROPFIND /remote.php/webdav/articles/C/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 207 945 x.x.x.x - tom [13/Apr/2013:10:54:18 +0200] &quot;PROPFIND /remote.php/webdav/articles/D/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 207 982 x.x.x.x - tom [13/Apr/2013:10:54:19 +0200] &quot;PROPFIND /remote.php/webdav/articles/E/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 207 922 As you can see, each PROPFIND operation can take up to second and every sync triggers a PROPFIND for every directory in the cloud. Consequently the sync takes a few minutes in which the webserver is quite busy. This wastes many resources. The iOS client uses a different model: It queries the webserver every time the user changes directory and only asks for the content of the directory the user wants to see. I think this makes a lot more sense than the 'loop through everything' approach. It would be great if this was configurable. My standard use case is: On the laptop, copy a file to owncloud, grab the tablet, read it. On Android I get a five minute wait between the copying and the reading and also my webserver is too busy with basically no-ops.

		The setup screen exceeds the available viewport because the keyboard is also displayed. (This we also need to optimize anyway.) But the most annoying thing about this is that you can’t scroll the view when you’re finished with the server address field. You have to manually click the »next« button on the keyboard. The view should simply be scrollable.

		Expected behaviour Many camera's these days use exif metadata to define whether an image was taken in landscape or portrait mode, yet always store the image in landscape mode. To properly display such images, the exif data should be parsed for rotation information and this information should be used to apply the proper rotation to the image before displaying it. Actual behaviour I have found the the owncloud client on android ignores the exif rotation information. As a result, images are displayed in the wrong direction. Turning the android device to put the image upright triggers the auto-rotate function resulting in the image being rotated back to its wrong orientation. Environment data Android version: 4.1.1 Device model: Asus Transformer Prime TF201 Stock system, with all official updates applied ownCloud app version: 1.4.0 ownCloud server version: 4.5 Logs Skipped. I don't think this issue requires logs. If you do need them, please tell me which ones to upload.

		Heyho, on my phone I now have every picture twice, once in my phone's camera/DCIM folder and once in the InstantUpload folder. This issue could maybe resolved by fixing #116, if also a folder on the phone could be synced. Then I would just point the sync to my camera folder (which would then also fix #149). ;-)

		the current develop branch supports the localization of the InstantUpload Folder. For, for me (DE) the folder name is now 'SofortUpload'. This folder does not exist at my server, so I get a http-404, the upload fails. If I create the folder manually by the web-interface, the upload works. Expected: The User should be asked for the usage of this new name At the case the folder doesn't exist and the user answered 'yes' for question 1. the folder should be created.

Here the correct files: 21.05.2013 13:18 3'185'208 DSC_0438.jpg 21.05.2013 13:18 3'359'122 DSC_0439.jpg 21.05.2013 13:18 2'039'503 DSC_0440.jpg 21.05.2013 13:19 2'142'841 DSC_0441.jpg 21.05.2013 13:19 2'090'055 DSC_0442.jpg Here the files uploaded via instant upload from android: 21.05.2013 13:23 113'208 DSC_0438.jpg 21.05.2013 13:24 1'311'122 DSC_0439.jpg 21.05.2013 13:25 1'015'503 DSC_0440.jpg 21.05.2013 13:25 2'142'841 DSC_0441.jpg 21.05.2013 13:26 2'090'055 DSC_0442.jpg What's strange is the fact that this are not incomplete uploads, but realy corrupted (+incomplete?) uploads Attached the correct (left side) header of DSC_0439.jpg and the corrupt (right side) upload of it When I comprae the file byte per byte, then I see that the corrupt upload of DSC_0438 starts with the bytes which are shown at offset 0x2EE000 in the correct file. In file DSC_0439 they start at 0x1F4000 In file DSC_0440 they start at 0xFA000 Not sure if it's related to issues #42 or/and #91

		At least this is what I was expecting. I know this means we need to implement two way sync. But I would like to sync simple todo.txt lists and my keepass files in both directions. @jancborchardt whats the UX opinion on this. We should at least try to find a better name for keep up to date. cc @mr-gosh

		Hi dev team, I decided to compile for myself the android client in order to start getting used to the code base and in a near future to contribute to this valuable project. So, the issue i hit is that after the successful login, I don't see any of the folders that I have in my owncloud share. But if I create a file, it will be updated and it will appear into the share. Android version: 1.4.0 (checked the tag oc-android-1.4.0) I tried also the current master. ownCloud server: FreeBSD port of ownCloud + Nginx + MySQL I hope is enough. Feel free to drop a line if something else is needed.

		I expect the Android client to behave the same way as the other desktop clients, that is, when I move or copy a file into my Owncloud account directory ( /storage/sdcard0/Owncloud/account@server/ ) from a file manager, the app should pick that new file and upload it to the server. The problem is that relying only on using &quot;share&quot; actions is that you end up with duplicate files (one in your Owncloud synced files, one in, say, your &quot;downloads&quot; directory). Also, as I said, it's inconsistent with other clients and counter intuitive (why does that file display in my sync directory but not in the Owncloud app?)

		Currently the big refresh icon increases the size of the Server address input field, and hence also pushes everything else down. Instead, the input field should keep its size. The icon could be a bit smaller (tappable area should still be big enough though!). It’s your call – maybe there’s a standard Android refresh-button-inside-of-input-field element?

		I tried to search for this, and hope this isn't a repeat issue. I was wondering if it would be possible to change or upon initial set-up to pick where your instant uploads go. I am running ownCloud and mounting an SMB share so I can have access to all my files on my file server. If I could have the ownCloud android app save my instant uploads to that SMB share, that would be amazing! That way I could centralize everything and not have to move things later. ownCloud has made it possible for me to start getting rid of my dropbox. You guys are awesome.

		There are several Android devices in the family. Somtimes the mobil devices are refreshed, damaged or handed to someone else in the family. Every time the privat information should be cleared, in most cases the Apps are also cleared. So the need to buy apps multiple times over time is evident. To ease and overcome this, I invision to have an app repository in my OC, where all the apps that where bought are residing. Actually the idea is, that there could be a OC-app serving as &quot;buying agent&quot;, that buying agent &quot;installs&quot; the apps into that repository for further use (not as an app that runs in the OC rather an app that will be available for redistribution to be installed on multiple devices, Than another service app in the OC would act as a &quot;market place&quot; that can be accessed by all mobil devices. All devices/users with access to the privat OC-bought apps repository, should be able to access the app market (kind of an internal store, where my Mobil devices could install all apps from this &quot;internal store&quot; - to the device. This is kind of a apps archive and &quot;redistribution&quot; idea for apps in my home mobil device infrastructure.

		SETUP.md is rather light on details on setting up a new environment for building the OC Android app. I'd like to setup an environment under Jenkins to be able to build and test every commit to develop. What I feel is missing: List of 3rd party libraries the app uses and links to how to build and install them List of software dependencies needed to build the app, specifying versions there are version dependencies Steps needed to build the app from the command line and for different environments (i.e. Eclipse). IMNSHO, without these details it makes it difficult for someone new to the project to get up an running quickly.

			<description>
		The OwnCloud Android app performs pretty poor on large file trees. FileListListAdapter traverses recursively through all subfolders get the file size of a directory while filling a view in getView(). This results in large database interactions in performance critical sections of the application. There are two possible solutions to this issue: calculate file size of directories on an own Thread. calculate file size of directories while syncing and safe directory size to the database. the latter one should be preferred as it doesn't fuck up the adapter and won't fill up the CPU/RAM/Stack

		By tapping the OC icon in the notification pull-down you can trigger an exploit which allows you to browse all your OC content without entering a PIN. There are many ways to trigger this: during or after an upload, using InstantUpload or manual upload, etc. Obviously, a prerequisite is that you have activated the app PIN in your settings. Example: Take a photo in order to trigger InstantUpload. Wait for the OC icon to appear in the notification bar. Pull down the notification bar and tap the icon. This will display the photo that was just uploaded. Tap &quot;menu&quot; and then &quot;details&quot;. The file details are displayed. Tap the &quot;back&quot; button once. This will take you to the directory listing (in this case the &quot;InstantUpload&quot; folder). Tap &quot;back&quot; again and you are in your root directory, with full access to all directories, files and app settings. Step 5 should return to the photo. Step 6 should return to the home screen. Whenever directories are accessed, the user should be prompted for the app PIN, if one has been set. Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 running Android 2.3.6, app 1.4.1 and OC 5.0.7.

		I really much miss the possibility to so select a folder for syncing on Android which is outside the /owncloud-folder. At the moment I still have to use Dropbox for making backups/syncing of appdata (like e.g. Titanium Backup). Many apps have Dropbox implemented which makes it easy to use. But since they are basically just uploading a file/folder, it would be very easy to replace this function by Owncloud, if the Owncloud-syncclient for Android would able to select the folder the data is stored on the phone.

		Expected behaviour App to react in a quick fashion, especially when in the same network as the server, with full WiFi reception. Actual behaviour The app is running unusably slow at the moment. Just when I start it, it takes about half a minute before it shows any folder listing, before it just shows the title bar and white for the rest of the screen. Then when it finally shows the file list, every action (clicking on any folder, clicking the back button, or even just clicking on the settings button or trying to save them) sometimes (every second time or so) takes about 10 seconds... frequently also the popup &quot;App is not reacting. Do you want to close it?&quot; pops up. I have no files which I keep &quot;up to date&quot;, the synchronisation in the account is disabled, I mainly use ownCloud on the android to access one file, which I infrequently manually download; I do have &quot;Instant Upload&quot; enabled (but that doesn't seem to be fully working either, it doesn't upload all my images, only some of them, but that's another story). When I'm saying the app is slow, I mean there is no feedback whatsoever if the app is still doing something (let alone what it is doing), the user interface is just stuck; when coming back from settings it sometimes just turns black for a few seconds... When coming back from the lock screen, I can't even scroll in the file list, I have to wait for a few seconds... Any more information I could provide to help resolve this? The GN shouldn't be that out of date for the app to run so slow? What could cause this? From my momentary perspective also the battery seems to drain quite fast when the app is running... Edit: Clearing the App's data didn't change anything. Will try reinstalling next, just to be sure. Edit 2: Great: After a re-install, it doesn't seem to be able to connect to the account again. It always (first time with the still existing account data, and two more times with the (definitely correctly) entered password) says &quot;invalid credentials&quot;. Edit 3: Removed and recreated the account, restarted the phone, re-tried entering the password several times, but now still just getting an unjustified &quot;Invalid credentials&quot; (the provided credentials are definitely correct). I guess this is basically the worst-case-scenario - going from unusably slow to not usable at all... Any hints what I could try? I've exhausted all usual methods of resolving Android app problems I could think of!

		(Like in the web interface, see owncloud/core#993. Same for iOS, see owncloud/ios-issues#85 ) An idea from iOS apps, probably also used elsewhere: The last entry in the list always says how many items there are in the list, for example »34 entries«. It should state the number of files and folders at the current level, like »5 folders and 49 files«. In grey and centered so it looks different from the actual files.

		Expected behaviour I recently installed owncloud on my server, and have successfully replicated 23 subdirectories (beneath the owncloud directory) from the Windows client. This is a total of around 5000 files. Replication works fine on those files to clients on other Windows machines. I have replicated this structure to the client on my Android phone (NTT docomo SC-02B - which is a Samsung Galaxy S), Apparently the replication proceeded perfectly. When I open the app, I expect to be able to use the app, scroll down through the folder list etc. Actual behaviour When I open the app, it starts correctly, and I can open and work with files in any directory that shows up on the first page of directory entries. However, immediately I scroll down through the directories and reach the 13th directory in the list, it consistently freezes the app, sometimes ending up with the &quot;wait/force close&quot; message, and sometimes ending up with the phone being completely locked and requiring a reboot. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, including using &quot;Clean Master&quot; to delete any old cache information, and the problem recurs Steps to reproduce See above Server configuration Operating system: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (12.04.2), with all updates updated Web server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) Database: MySQL 5.5.31-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 - (Ubuntu) PHP version: PHP Version 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 ownCloud version: 5.0.8 Client configuration Browser: Operating system: Gingerbread 2.6.35.7-1217619se,infra@SEP-40#2 kernel Logs Web server error log PHP Deprecated:  Comments starting with '#' are deprecated in /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/ming.ini on line 1 in Unknown on line 0

		this free software project, if developed a bit, would enable syncing owncloud calendars with android's calendar app: https://github.com/gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater however, it's incomplete. there's no other free software app i know of that allows caldav to be used with android's default calendar. the only other option i know of is acal, and it's got some fairly major issues. it would be really nice if owncloud's calendar could be used on android with free software.

		Expected behaviour The Owncloud file client on Android and iPad doesn't show files, that were deleted on the server before. Actual behaviour The Owncloud file client on Android and iPad shows the last file, that was deleted on the server before. Trying to access that file from the Android/iPad client results in an error message, that either the file is broken or doesn't exist. It works after a while and I assume, because I closed and reopened the ownCloud site in my browser on the server. Steps to reproduce On the server delete some files in the browser. In the Android or iPad ownCloud client hit 'Refresh' Server configuration MAMP-Stack from week 29/2013. Operating system: OSX 10.6.8 Web server: Apache/2.2.23 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.23 OpenSSL/0.9.8x DAV/2 PHP/5.4.10 Database: SQLite PHP version: 5.4.10 ownCloud version: 4.5.13 Browser: Firefox 22.0 Operating system: OSX 10.6.8 Client configuration Android: 2.2 Latest ownCloud client iPad: iOS 6.1.3 Latest ownCloud client

		This is my first time submitting an issue so bear with me. Expected behaviour Able to choose a default app for playing downloaded songs (mp3) instead of the built-in ownCloud music player. Actual behaviour When I try to download or listen to mp3-files that I have already downloaded, ownCloud still tries to open them in the built-in ownCloud music player instead of Google Music that I have choosen as my default player. I have already tried the following from the ownCloud music player: Hit &quot;Menu&quot; &gt; &quot;Open with&quot; and set Google Music as my default/standard player. But ownCloud does not respect this and insists on opening the file with the ownCloud built-in music player first so I have to use the &quot;Open with&quot; every time I want to listen to a mp3 from the ownCloud app. Is there a way to disable the built-in ownCloud music player? Environment data Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note II Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.4.3 ownCloud server version: 5.0.9

		When Auto-Upload is activated in the app, the images are uploaded to the localized Folder-Name of &quot;InstantUpload&quot;, so devices with different system language sync to different folders, and there is no migration from the old name, so its even a problem when using just one device. so only the display name of the folder should be changed (or not, InstantUpload is just okay), not the name on the server.

		Currently, files are synced to /data/owncloud//. It would be handy if you could specify the location where data is synced. I used Dropbox to sync to my SD card so that I could mount it as a USB drive for read-write access.

		Suppose OC has been force closed. Then Instant Upload does not upload the picture. -- It is hard to know which pictures have been uploaded and which not. -- it would be nice to make OC sync the whole Camera folder and check which ones have been uploaded, and which ones not.

		I'm using the actual client on Android 2.3. The client forgets the login data (server, username and password) after each reboot of the phone. It seems that this happens only if the client is moved to the sd card. It doesn't occur when the app is stored in the phone memory. Any other people with this problem?

		Since one of the last updates the client no longer connect to my ownCloud 5.0.9, Android 4.1.2. I just get a &quot;sync error, wrong password&quot; error message. But the password is correct, I double-checked it. Other apps like the third-party carddav and caldav app can connect to my ownCloud just fine. Therefore I assume that it must be client related. I will happily provide more information if needed. Just tell me what you need. For the ssl connection I used a CACert signed certificate, but this was never a problem before. If useful I could also provide a test account on my ownCloud to one of the developers.

		I am using my own installation of OwnCloud 5.0.10, and the Android client 1.4.4. My WiFi network at work redirects all traffic to a login page. Once you've logged in it remembers your device (presumably by MAC address?) and stops redirecting traffic. If I attempt to browse my server using the Android client before I log in, no error is displayed. Instead, I'm presented with an empty / folder. If I exit the client, browse to a website, log in to WiFi, then return to the client, then I can see my files. I'd expect that if the client receives a nonsensical response (e.g. a WiFi login page) it'd display some sort of error message instead of just an empty file list.

		Consider the following use case: I use my device as an offline reader for PDFs that I find throughout the day on my desktop. When I find a document that I want to read later, I copy it to an ownCloud-shared folder. When I get to my Android device, I want all files collected during the day to be available on it, even in offline mode. Currently I have to perform the following tiresome sequence on the device: Press &quot;Update&quot; and wait until finishes Open the folder used to store new documents Click on each of the documents so that it gets downloaded and opened in a PDF viewer Close the viewer and proceed to the next file. When there are more than a couple of new files this sequence becomes a really boring thing to do. What I want to suggest is that certain folders can be marked as auto-update, just like it can be done for individual files today. The above scenario becomes much more simple: 0. Mark a folder as &quot;auto-update&quot; (once) Press &quot;Update&quot; and wait until all new files are downloaded to the device.

		I' running the owncloud app version 1.4.4 on a 4.3 android phone. If i have enable ssl via the webinterface and download a file up to 97MB, the server gets busy up to 100%. The only thing what i can do, is reset the server, no input are possible. Smaler files are no problems if ssl is enabled. If it is disabled i can also download bigger files without problems. Owncloud server is 5.0.10 Is this a problem of the ssl certificate or is this a problem of android 4.3 or a problem of the owncloud app?

		After using Owncloud on my Windows-PC I purchased the Android Owncloud App from the Amazon App Shop. I got it to work without problem. Today when I wanted to use it on my Android Tablet again I got a notice that this app needs that I am logged in to the Amazon-App-Shop to work. ????????? After some time then I get a notice that an internal error has happened. I do not want to login to the Amazon Shop if I do not want to buy anything there. Is this a walware which wants to fish my Amazon login data? Franz47 Franz47 Newbie Beiträge: 2

		If I have a weak network connection it happens quite often that my mobile phone loses the connection during an instant upload. The app informs me that the upload failed but it is quite hard to find out which files are uploaded and which not when I'm back on my desktop. It would be a great improvement if the Android app would remember which instant uploads failed and try to upload them again later. Maybe after a given timespan or simply if a new instant upload gets triggered because the user took a new photo.

		Hi, Installed the updated ownCloud-app and the automatic upload of images is broken. It worked fine with 1.4.4. I have both tried to reinstall the app and the workaround-app multiple times and also tried rebooting the phone. Had similar problem when I upgraded to 1.4.4, but that time the problem was the login.. Is there a way for me to extract some kind of logs from the app? Expected behaviour Automatic upload of pictures taken with the camera. Actual behaviour No upload of images. I have to manually select the images from my gallery app or from inside of the ownCloud-app.. Environment data Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note II (Nordic version) Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.4.5 ownCloud server version: 5.0.10

		I am a beginner in developing android apps in general. I downloaded the Eclipse ADT from google. I got most of anything available of the SDKs, the different versions and API releases, via the SDK manager. I got the sources for OC android app from git/here. It is mentioned actionbarsherlock but incidentally the corresponding folder here is empty. I went here: http://actionbarsherlock.com/download.html I got the actionbarsherlock tarball which I tried to integrate with owncloud android. I failed. There definitely is something I am not doing right to integrate the two and finalise a buildable owncloud app. Is it possible to have some instructions for beginners on how to build the downloaded projects fresh as they are from source? Some instructions which when followed on fresh installs/setups, would get the source to build successfully? I feel very disheartened that a copy-paste style of building an existing project, on a fresh environment, by following the available instructions, fails. Can there be some more detailed instructions on what does the owncloud android app need and depends on? (Such as actionbarsherlock). How to properly integrate them and result in a buildable OC app project from the main source, vanilla as is?

		I have something around 40k files on my ownCloud storage and while the thing works just fine on the desktop the Android-client insists on reading every single god damn file on the whole cloud storage system -- there is no way of just showing the contents of the directory you're looking at -- and this scouring for every single god damn file is so horribly, horribly slow that it never completes, eventually it just throws an error message and gives up. These 40k files are in a sub-directory of their own, but still the client insists on walking through them all. This obviously makes the Android-client completely unuseable unless I remove those 40k files from the system! Find a way of making the client work properly even in the presence of such high number of files.

		Very nice work! 3 thoughts: The update procedure seems to be called even when there is no Internet connection (at least the update circle is shown for a moment before it disappears). This does not happen when manually initiating a &quot;refresh account&quot;. Is there a check for Internet connectivity? Can it also be used to this &quot;refresh_folder_contents_when_browsed_into&quot; feature? Folders are refreshed when browsed into. But also when coming out. It that necessary? When you step down the folder hierarchy, you usually just stepped up moments before, didn't you? So could here bandwidth be saved (for sacrificing a little freshness)?

		As it was said in the title, if the system language is Chinese, whenever I tried to do &quot;Settings&quot;, the app crash, for 1.4.5 and 1.4.6. 1.4.4 didn't have this problem. If I switch the system language to English (so does the app language), it will not crash, even for 1.4.6 (1.4.5 not tested but should be the same). I'm using the version from f-droid.

		I have my own Owncloud server running over https. My Linux desktop client syncs fine. When I bring up the Owncloud app on my Android phone, I see my folders and files, but once I try to read a file it says the download failed. Then it brings me to the login page, where I log in with the same ID/password I'm using for the desktop client, but it says &quot;wrong username or password&quot; each time. This is over SSL. I get this in my SSL access logs when I attempt to log in: 10.1.10.111 - david [10/Nov/2013:23:14:15 -0500] &quot;HEAD /owncloud/remote.php/webdav/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 401 1328 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; (Note that I have CalDAV and CardDAV syncing working fine on my phone) My SSL error logs have: [Sun Nov 10 23:14:15 2013] [info] [client 10.1.10.111] Connection to child 8 established (server thekramers.net:443) [Sun Nov 10 23:14:20 2013] [info] client 10.1.10.111The timeout specified has expired: SSL input filter read failed. but I'm not sure that's an actual problem or not. In a few weeks I'm giving a talk about syncing data with an Android phone without involving Google, so I'm hoping to have it by then, as Owncloud is a big part of the presentation. Thanks.

		Currently the icon in the top bar is the same as the app icon: White/light with rounded corners. This looks very off in the top bar. Much like on iOS, the icon in the top bar should be the cloud in light/white, without anything around it, directly on the dark background of the top bar. cc @MTRichards @rperezb @davivel

		Heyho, imagine I have an audiobook with 30 files in my owncloud and I will go on a (looong) train ride soon, where I would like to listen to it. How do I download them? Currently this involves 30 click+return-to-folder moves, which is crazy. Solution: Add another menu item &quot;Download entire folder&quot;, which downloads all files that are either missing locally or are not up to date locally. Thx for your time Laryllian PS. Related: #116

		Android comes in lots of different flavors and variations. This can lead to discrepancies among devoces and OS versions. In order to help solve this I'd like the ability to change the source folder for the Auto Image Upload feature. So instead of the default /sdcard/DCIM/Camera I can change it to /extSdCard/myPictures/After_Market_Camera or anything else for that matter. The ability to change the source folder would greatly increase the compatability and would likely lead to a lot of the issues being closed.

		Hi, I have been using owncloud to sync Linux, Windows and Android devices for a while already. I placed the files to sync on the clients in a &quot;clientsync&quot; folder. I just reinstalled my phone from scratch (Samsung Galaxy Nexus cyanogenmod 3.0.72) and the latest version of owncloud that I installed (1.5.0) does not seem to allow me to sync only the remote &quot;clientsync&quot; folder. Instead it syncs the whole of my owncloud storage which has thousands of files irrelevant to my phone. Is there a way to sync only the remote &quot;clientsync&quot; folder like it was in the past? Thanks.

		I use Titanium backup to make backups of all my apps. Now, I'm very anal retentive and want to back these up to my ownCloud instance, so I set Titanium to back up to a folder under ownCloud. However, the only way to get it to sync is to 'upload' each file manually, which is time consuming. Yes, I can do it 'once' and then it will sync changes, but if I install a new app I have to remember to do this. I think a feature that'd be useful, would be to set up a folder on my Android and allow that to sync any changes and upload folders/files automatically.

		Didn't find this in issues for enhancements or anything so thought I would throw it out there. Would be nice to have a menu of button option to add a new folder/directory whenever you are uploading a file via Share ... for instance, under gallery you're viewing a picture, you click on share icon like you would for Facebook, Owncloud, etc, right now you can only upload to existing folders, would be nice to be able to add a new directory :)

		Expected behaviour Files added or removed from root folder should appear or disappear from Android client when the client is refreshed. Actual behaviour Files appear correctly after the first login. After that, files in the root folder do not change to match changes made on the server. If a file is added, removed or renamed it will remain the same in the Android client. Refresh, reboot and app relaunch don't help. Resetting the app data or reinstalling the app does cause the contents to refresh once (after logging in again). Folders work normally. Files inside folders work normally. The problem is only with files in the root folder. Steps to reproduce Install Android app Login and note files in root folder are correct Change a file (add, delete or rename) using the web interface or sync client. Refresh the Android app and note that files in the root folder do not change Environment data Android version: 4.3 and 4.2.2 Device model: Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 Stock or customized system: One custom, one stock ownCloud app version: 1.5.0 ownCloud server version: 4.5.13 running on CentOS 6 (installed from epel yum repository)

		Since I upgraded from OC 5 to 6.0 (RC2, RC4 and now the final version), every time I upload a file to a shared folder (==a folder someone has shared with me) Android app (v 1.5.1), the upload is done correctly (the file gets uploaded), but the rename seems to fail (files remain with their temporary name: .ocTransferIdXXX). The apps shows that an error happened in the upload. I don't know if the issue is client-side or server-side, it is happening on both Android and IOs clients (not while uploading through browser or windows desktop client). I've created an issue also on the IOs section (owncloud/ios-issues#146) I would appreciate it if someone could try to reproduce the issue so that we know if it's a general problem or something wrong with my setup. Steps: 1- User A shared a folder &quot;MyFolder&quot; to User B with all the permissions granted 2- User B, using the Android mobile app, tries to upload a file to MyFolder The upload fails on the client, but the file has been uploaded but not renamed from the temporary name (which includes the .ocTransferIdXXX suffix) Cheers Cheers

		Provide an option to specify the InstantUpload-Folder. It would be nice if it wouldn't be just the hardcoded locale-dependent like SofortUpload. I've got the need, that I have to sort all data of my phone in on one folder and in another the data of my Laptop, so it would be nice, if the DirectUpload function would move the file automatically into a nested tree, without doing manual actions. Use something like a menu, which chooses a folder and use only as default the folder SofortUpload.

		I just ran into this issue: A few days ago I downloaded a file with Android ownCloud -&gt; Green triangle with down arrow appeared. Today I wanted to view the file again (it was updated on the server in the mean time). The file date was updated, so Android ownCloud detected a file change. The green triangle stayed however. When selecting the file, it opened the old version of the file (which I of course noticed too late). Solution: Long click on file &quot;Update file&quot;. This is not intuitive. Possible fixes: Suggestion A: Delete offline file when update is detected (green triangle dissappears as soon file date changes). Suggestion B: When clicking an updated file warn user that file has changed on server and suggest to download uptodate copy. Suggestion C: When clicking file, download new version. In case of no connection, suggest to open old version of file. EDITED @rperezb and @owncloud/android-developers : Taking into account the feedback in this issue as well as the current behavior of the ownCloud iOS app the option selected is *C - When clicking file, download new version. In case of no connection, open old version of file * In case of conflict (different versions local and server) the way to go is the regular one: Open the local version Set the file as conflict one (labelled with the icon) Fix the conflict taking advantage of the sync option where the user will be offered to rename, duplicate or cancel EDITED @malkomich: TASKS [GIT] Create 333_update_server_changes_on_download_files branch from master in android repo @malkomich [DEV] Perform a sync operation when the file is opened @malkomich [DEV] Launch an advise and capture it when the sync/download operation finish @jabarros [DEV] Update dinamically the content of the file on the file preview @jabarros [QA] Create 333_update_server_changes_on_download_files branch from master in QA repo @jesmrec [QA] Merge 333_update_server_changes_on_download_files branch into master in QA repo (PR #1736) [QA] Create test plan @jesmrec [QA] Validate test plan @mcastroSG [GIT] Merge 333_update_server_changes_on_download_files branch into master in android repo BUGS Media files (audio and video) are not refreshed when a new version is downloaded from the server #333 (comment) [FIXED] Image files are not refreshed with the new version when clicked [FIXED] Too many messages &quot;file is already synced&quot; [READY_TO_TEST] Not previewable files are not refreshed with the new version when clicked [FIXED] Track download progress in previews when a fresh version of the file is downloading in background [FIXED] Conflict resolved with both files does not end properly. #333 (comment) App crashes after set a photo as available offline and tap on another photo #333 (comment) [FIXED] Available offline state is not shown properly #333 (comment) [FIXED]

		Expected behaviour On same wifi as owncloud server, I expect uploads to happen fast without issue. If it does fail for whatever issue, I expect it to recognize it fast. Actual behaviour Doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes the upload fails or even stalls. I think the uploads also seem slow for being on the same wifi as the server, but I can't really say for sure. What do I mean by stall? While uploading a 25 megs file, the notification bar says it has been at 38% for atleast a confirmed 1 hour, with no sign of moving or registering as a fail. When I click the notification icon, it opens up the file view, but shows no progress bar at all. The file isn't visible on the server through normal web view. As best I can tell there is no way to cancel this upload either. The destination folder wasn't a shared folder, just a normal one. Steps to reproduce Upload multiple files (above 2 megs, sometimes around 20 megs). I was uploading through the share within ROM Toolbox trying to backup all my apps. But I have had this happen with share within Gallery too with multiple files. Rinse and repeat until it happens. It doesn't happen all the time, I was able to upload probably 300 megs until one file stalled. Environment data Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Droid Bionic Stock or customized system: rooted stock ownCloud app version:1.5.2 ownCloud server version: 6.0.0a (stable) Logs Web server error log The date this happened is 12/29. The log wasn't set to everything until after the event, so basically nothing was shown in the log on the issue. The server log was set to whatever is default with the installation.

		Hello guys! Owncloud is missing some basic features to make it usable on android. I'm unable to share pictures from owncloud to other applications. All I can find is the &quot;Open With&quot; option, with does not comply with the interface guidelines. Steps to reproduces: Open an image with OwnCloud Search for Share button to share it with other applications. What should happen: There should be a &quot;Share it&quot; button which can be used to share the pic with other applications. I.e. WhatsApp What actually happens: There's a &quot;Open With&quot; Button which enables me to view the picture in the Gallery App, never the less, I'm unable to share the picture with other applications than that one, neither from Owncloud itself nor from the opening Gallery App My System: Motorola Photon Q with Cyanogenmod 10.2 (Android 4.3)

		Hello, ownCloud client 1.5.2 on KitKat When I have setup the ownlocud client to do a instant upload, but only when on WIFI, this works fine so long I'm on wifi when taking the picture(s). When I am out of any wifi connection and take fotos, then I expect the instant upload to start as soon as I have a wifi connection. Currently these fotos are never uploaded to the owncloud server

		I have been trying to allow @davivel to do some testing with the Android application. I got him a user setup but the uploads are failing and the site is very sluggish. He had suggested I open a new ticket and work with someone to improve the site performance and get it setup so that it is working at 100% so we can start the Android app testing.

		After enabling the InstantUpload feature, all photo files seem to be duplicated by the client - they exist once in their original location in the DCIM folder, and once in the /owncloud/user@ochost/(Instant|Sofort)Upload folder. This seems redundant to me - I don't see any use in having those duplicate files? The only thing I can think of which such a copy could achieve would be marking which files are successfully uploaded? But there surely is a simpler way of doing that than to just copy the file? Maybe store a file with the same name as the image plus e.g. .hash suffix, containing a hash of the uploaded file? Those copies just wastes a lot of space on my (non-extensible) internal storage. Using the latest version available in Market (1.4.3). Server version is 6.0.1 (but is going on since 5.0.13 at least).

		Not sure if this is the right place. Among many other folders I am syncing one with MP3s. When I click on one, I can play and hear it. But I cannot load it into the music player nor to a playlist. I want to avoid copying files from the OwnCloud directory to the music folder with the default Android FileManager. This goes against the idea of syncing. Any ideas?

		Our ownCloud account(s) password(s) is(/are) stored in plaintext under the &quot;password&quot; column, into the database file: /data/system/account.db Wouldn't it be - for example - possible to at least obfuscate it in order to have it a bit more protected ? Even though we should not, you know that many of us have rooted phones, and it could be a (slight) security plus for our ownCloud account(s) security not to store them as pure plaintext ... don't you think so ?

		As you know we generate »filename (2)« for duplicates. Currently sorting goes like this: filename (2) filename (3) filename Which makes it pretty confusing since the original document is all the way on the bottom. Instead it should go like this: filename filename (2) filename (3) Even worse, when you have numbers in parentheses which exceed 10, it sorts like this: filename (18) filename (19) filename (2) filename (20) filename (21)

		Currently when viewing a picture, the background is white. This brightness really distracts from the picture itself. Instead, the background should be black (as in #000). That blends in with the notification bar and lower bar and gives full emphasis on the pictures also, the icons in the lower bar and notification bar distract. When you’re in the »view mode« (after you tap the image) where the app top bar is hidden, the icons of the notification bar and lower bar should be hidden (only visible as slight dots) just like in the normal Gallery app

		I was asked to file a bug report on the forum. It seems the test as you type the server address causes an issue if you have an invalid SSL cert which many of us will have running home based servers. While typing in the server address the client tests it and and invalid SSL Cert dialog pops up but then the next character I had already started typing brings focus back to the client so the SSL Cert Dialog is moved to the background and the connection can't be completed because its waiting on the dialog to be closed.

If that file was huge it would waste the mobile device's space without the user knowing. Versions Android app: 1.5.3 OC server: 6.0.1 File Manager: Ghost Commander

		I have an HTC One V that I would really like to replace Dropbox's Camera Upload with something I am in control of. I got this to work perfectly with a Samsung Galaxy S3. Now I need to add an HTC One V to the same setup. I install the app, turn on uploading of pictures, take a picture, and nothing happens. I have looked through the owncloud forums and this issue tracker and it appears that this bug was resolved? Please let me know if I can provide more information. This is with the android app v1.5.4 and server 6.01

		The update today (or yesterday, the one with sharing) made the ownCloud app icon vanish from the homescreen. As far as I remember this is not the first time this happens, and it sometimes happens with other apps too. I searched around a bit and it might be a problem the apps themselves need to handle: http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1s3fn3/anybody_else_notice_every_time_apps_update_in/ If an app changes the name/class of the default activity, the icon is removed. This is what causes some of it. Any idea @davivel?

		I have a local folder. In that folder i created a folder with content. At the next sync, the client downloaded te complete folder. The owncloud webinterface shows that all the files and folders have not changed within a year (wich is correct) and the new local folder is uploaded. I did not login in the webinterface that day and there are no other users using that folder. I use ownCloud 5.0.14a on Apache an Ubuntu 12 Client is Windows 8 Owncloud client is 1.5.2 buiold 2445 (the latest at this moment)

		Dear reader, i searched the forums and found similar problems but no real fix for it. I have a Galaxy S4 and Owncloud installed on Linux. The owncloud is functioning fine, i can login with the App on Samsung S3, S2 and Webdav on win7 and with webbrowsers. So the problems doesnt seem to be in the server but on the S4. The S4 has Android version 4.3 on it. What happens is, as soon as i open the App (after i put in the server and password) a blank screen comes with the little Cloud in the Top and thats it. After that it does nothing. Does anyone has any ideas on how to fix this ? Thank you very much for your response in advance. And i already tried de-install and re-install etc. P.

		Expected behaviour Client is expected to connect to the server and login. Actual behaviour Client is unable to connect to the server using SSL with self-signed wildcard 4096 bit certificate. Login fails with vanilla error &quot;Unknown error occurred&quot;. Webserver identification string was altered to &quot;Anarchy webserver&quot; in source code prior to the compilation. However, this behavior should not affect client functionality when connecting. Steps to reproduce Wildcard certificate was imported into Android and is successfully used with another app for the same server. Open app, try to login =&gt; error message.

		I use the ownCloud app for android version 1.5.4 on my Google Nexus 5 (Kitkat 4.4.2). Somehow direct sharing of images doesn't work, no error whatsoever or at least not on screen or in the logs I viewed. Looks like the OC server isn't even accessed. For example I open gallery, choose a picture, choose owncloud in the sharing menu. Owncloud opens, I browse to my photo folder and click on upload. Nothing at all, again not even an error. Other types of files do work.

		The app should never start itself when photo upload is disabled. At the moment the app (1.5.4) consumes most of the battery capacity even when it does not seem to run. Deleting Owncloud folder, &quot;App data&quot;, &quot;Cache&quot; and rebooting does not help. Astonishingly, after doing all this the app still has my credentials and lists my server's data. I will wait with uninstalling to provide more information if needed. The loading circle in the app always rotates. Maybe this is helpful.

		Expected behaviour If I want to download several mp3 files from the server but to playback them with another player than the ownCloud client itself, I would like to have some item in the long press menu that says &quot;Download&quot;. Actual behaviour At the moment if I open a mp3 file the app opens a file view where it downloads the file and starts playback afterwards. Downloading several mp3 files from the server requires to &quot;open&quot; every file separately, wait for the download indicator to start, get back to the containing folder, open the next file and repeat the procedure for every file.

		Dear devs, from my point of view the current android client already works quite well - congratulation for that :) A very handy and convenient option of Instant Upload would be the &quot;upload all&quot; option, meaning to take to all existing photos (e.g. in the DCIM folder) into account and when this function is triggered, upload all of them to the &quot;instant upload&quot; folder of owncloud (best would be to only upload the missing one in the cloud). With this method a user could easily complete his cloud picture archieve, due to failed uploads or prior to installation of the owncloud client. P.S. A similar option is available with Google Plus and their instant upload funtctionality.

		We think it would be ideal if you had the ability to change the folder your instant uploads go to. When sharing multiple users instant uploads you end up with a bunch of numbered instant upload folder and you do not know who's is who's. Additionally, the owners user or full name next to the shared folder would help with this problem and others, so either or both would be a welcome fix and improvement in functionality.

		Currently when I want to upload a file, the dialog shows the hidden files and folders before the other ones. This is very distracting since the hidden files Four possible solutions: Don’t show hidden folders or files (I don’t think that’s good because you might want to upload them) Have a switch to show hidden files (Might be good, but a bit more work and it would be a prominent switch.) Sort hidden files and folders after normal files and folders (Not very elegant and just shifts the problem) Sort hdiden files and folders among normal files and folders, alphabetically. Basically just omit the dot when sorting. I think option 4 is the most elegant and easy one. What do you think @rperezb @davivel?

		My owncloud server is running in https only on a nginx server and I use server certificates from cacert, cacert root certificates are not included on my android device (and probably in any android). When I installed the owncloud app it was able to connect without problems to the server but I was only able to browse and read the files, any attempt to upload did stalled forever, in the server log I found lots of lines like those: x.x.x.x - username [04/Apr/2014:20:49:54 +0200] &quot;HEAD /remote.php/webdav/documents/0523acaa096b5e583292145dc8bb77be%20(7).jpg HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; x.x.x.x - username [04/Apr/2014:20:49:55 +0200] &quot;HEAD /remote.php/webdav/documents/0523acaa096b5e583292145dc8bb77be%20(8).jpg HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; x.x.x.x - username [04/Apr/2014:20:49:55 +0200] &quot;HEAD /remote.php/webdav/documents/0523acaa096b5e583292145dc8bb77be%20(9).jpg HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; but nothing was uploaded. Today I installed CACert's root certificates on my android device and viola, everything works perfectly. I just wanted to let you know since I was not able to find a solution online, maybe others have a similar problem with a server using certificates not issued by a CA trusted by Android.

		Current situation: Prerequisite: have pending files that need to be uploaded to the ownCloud server. For example new images from the camera that should be automatically uploaded through InstantUpload folder. In Android go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; and delete the associated ownCloud account the Android ownCloud app will continue to try to upload the files and display error messages in the notification bar (File xyz could not be uploaded to the server). Expected behavior: Delete the associated ownCloud account. The ownCloud app will not attempt to sync, upload or download as there is no account associated.

		AC: There must be a new option on the action bar in the navigation drawer called Uploads should it be on the bar or under the menu botton as they are the settign or sync options? Those files that have been uploaded recently must be shown on the uploads screen No matter if the app is closed or the process killed, the files must be shown too Only the info of the active account will be shown There will be 3 sections: Current: uploads in progress, the progress bar will be shown, and on the right the cancel button so that it will be possible to cancel the upload Besides, those uploads failed because of a network error will be shown too (such as offline uploads); to distinguish these ones from those that are in progress, a message under the file name: &quot;waiting for server connection&quot; will be shown instead of the progress bar. Failed uploads: these are uploads that have failed and need the user attention Credentials error: in case the password has changed, by clicking on the file, the login view will be shown so that the user can update the password and the uploads goes on Folder do not exist: in case the folder where it was expected to upload the file does not exist; by clicking on this file, the folder tree will be shown so that the user can select a new destination Conflict error: in the long run, by clicking on the file it will be shown the 3 options, overwritte, rename or cancel (ftm it is still not implemented) Permission error: in case the user does not have permissions to upload any file to that folder, by clicking on it, the folder tree will be shown so that a new folder may be selected Uploaded Where succesful uploads will be shown The number of successful uploaded files shown will be limited to 30 max Files will be displayed deppending on its upload time, the latest the first shown. Besides the file name, the size, when it was uploaded (relative dates), and path will be displayed too.

		Some questions about the favorite feature: At the moment, version 1.5.5 it is only possible to set a file as favorite from the details view of the file. Will it make sense to add this option to the long press menu as well? So that it will be possible to set the file as favorite from the file list. On the other hand, on the current version (1.5.5) it is only used one icon, the grey arrow, should we change it to the yellow one and the grey one? Deppending whether the file is updated or pending to be updated? It is possible to delete a file and it remains being a favorite file, however, we have desinged a different behavior on the iOS side, owncloud/ios-issues#26, I guess that we will follow the same behavior, don´t we

		When having the option &quot;only upload when on wifi&quot; checked i noticed a small problem when being abroad. Most hotel-wifis are open wifis but they need some kind of login through the browser. Owncloud client only checks to see if its connected to a wifi, when it actually should be checking if it is connected to internet(or atleast the owncloud server). Having used the camera quite alot the result was hundreds of notifications of failed uploads.

		Currently when switching folders, there is no animation at all, the new folder just flashes in. This is very confusing as to what happens. Instead, there should be a left/right animation, much like on iOS. Deeper subfolders should move in from the right, and going back should move the parent folder in from the left. cc @rperezb @davivel @masensio

		The Android News-App gets a new icon (owncloud/News-Android-App#199), the official android files app should to that, too. this would look the android apps much more consistent, as all apps have the same scheme (blue gradien background with flat white logo). Owncloud Webinterface itself uses a white cloud on blue background, too. I tried it with the grey cloud, too. But this didn't look very nice. My suggestion is this: Opionions? @jancborchardt

Expected Behaviour 👍 I am able to set in the settings the target-directory, where all my direct uploads are uploaded to. So i would be able to set my folder &quot;Images&quot;. And if i shoot a photo with my mobile phone camera, the taken photo will be uploaded directly to my &quot;Images&quot;-Folder.

		for English, pleas scroll down! Und zwar fiel mir heute auf, das mein Handy (Galaxy S3 / CyanogenMod / Android 4.3.1) schon mindestens seit Wochen keine Textdateien zum Server synct. Nur lokal liegt immer die akuellste Version richtig vor. Aktualisiere ich einen Dateiinhalt am Telefon erscheint zwar die Meldung, dass die Datei erfolgreich hoch geladen wurde und auf dem Server wird das Datum des Elternverzeichnisses aktualisiert. Aber beim öffnen über den Browser der wird weiterhin der veraltete Textinhalt angezeigt. Ich hab mit allen Mitteln versucht den Sync zu erzwingen. Manuell in der App das Verz und das ganze Konto, ab-/anmelden auf beiden Geräten usw.. Leider ohne erkennbaren Erfolg. The app does not sync completely textfiles with the server. If in the in the app the content of an file will be updated, the notice &quot;file uploaded successfully&quot; occurs and the date of the directory on the server gets the correct new update-time. But the content of the file will not be updated. I tried everything i know to force the sync. Manually in the app the folder and the whole account and to log-in/-out on the device and the browser. But nothing changes. greetz, Rob

		Currently after the photo is taken it's saved to two places - to my photos directory (that's expected) and to owncloud directory on the phone. The photo takes double space because of that. I'm interested in getting my photo sent to owncloud... and that's all I want :) This is really a problem because the owncloud location is not customizable and it goes to my very small internal storage. From time to time I have to remove the photos from the instant uploads directory (locally only).

		It would be much better if the user could choose which folder he or she wants to put the InstantUpload photos (and soon videos) instead of a hard coded folder. In this way the user can have only one single folder wit all the pictures instead of having to make folders inside of the InstantUpload folder to make all the pictures end up in the same place. It would be preferred to be able to choose folder both for videos, and also for photos to make the separate.

		I have a generic website hosted by godaddy. From there I added a subdomain to point to an ip address such that owncloud6.mydomain.com points to https://192.168.0.1/owncloud6 (that is not the real ip address). The web browser successfully forwards (showing https://192.168.0.1/owncloud6 in the address bar). Expected behaviour The client should be able to handle 301 redirects. Actual behaviour The app lets me go through the authentication/authorization process.

		I was going over my data limit really early in the month and I've found that even with mobile upload off Owncloud has used 550mb in 20 days. This is with one account and no usage outside wifi except a few browses and downloads. Is there a way to work out how this is happening? I would have expected usage closer to 100mb with my usage of the app. Could the account sync be parsing my whole file database regularly? I have about 30gb in my Owncloud.

		Hello, I recently downloaded the Android App and I received an error message right after entering the Server URL. The message was &quot;Cannot authenticate against this server&quot;. There was an update a couple days ago, which just translated the error message into German. For info: the iOS App is running well with the same server. So I really imagine the problem is on client side. Also web login and desktop clients work fine as well. I hope it is ok to post this (blocking) issue here, as it looks like the Xing Group is not the right place to post. Best regards, Matthias

The notification stays there. EDIT: I want to upload a screenshot. I was in gallery and shared with ownCloud APP. Then upload to the instant upload folder and it starts uploading. after a while it stops uplpading and clicking the notification the APP opens and just crashes. I will open a github issue with a Screenshot of the notification

		The ownCloud newsreader app from @David-Development contains a function to import the credentials from other ownCloud apps. It would be awesome to share that code between the different apps that uses ownCloud. Otherwise the user have to type in the same credentials in each app. Is this possible to co-work on this?

		Expected behaviour When I share a note with the ownCloud app from the Google Keep app it should be uploaded to the ownCloud datastore. Actual behaviour If it's a text only note, the message No content was received. Nothing to upload. is shown. If the note contains an image, I'm asked for a target folder. But after clicking Upload nothing happens. Steps to reproduce Compose a note in Google Keep. Choose Menu &gt; Share. Choose ownCloud and submit using Just once. Environment data Android version:4.4.2 Device model: Google Nexus 5 Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.5.6 ownCloud server version:6.0.2 (stable) UPDATE by @davivel: the sequence should be valid for any Android app that sends text to the Android app; for instance, the case is the same for Evernote in issue #568

			<description>
		Traveled abroad yesterday and noticed something strange with the automatic upload of pictures. My default setting is to only upload when connected to Wi-Fi. All was well until I connected my phone to the airport network that requires me too start the browser and accept the TOS. Only after that do I get a connection to the Internet. What happened was that before I had a chance to accept the TOS, ownCloud started to try and upload 400 images (3-400MB in total) that I took during my visit. And of course the upload failed. But after accepting the TOS, the upload worked. And then it was time for me to board my flight and I switched off Wi-Fi and expected the upload to stop, but no, instead the upload jumped over to the cellular network and started to eat away my precious 20 MB/day quota when I’m abroad. Managed to switch off the cellular network and the uploads started to fail, after killing the app in the Android settings did the madness stop. Android did notify me when I connected to the airport Wi-Fi that I needed to sign in/accept the TOS. Is it possible to get the ownCloud app to halt the upload until there actually is a working connection to the Internet and not just a connection to a local Wi-Fi/AP network? It should try to “ping” the server and see if it gets a valid response back before starting the automatic upload. Expected behaviour Upload should have stopped when the Wi-Fi connection was turned off. Actual behaviour When Wi-Fi was turned off, the ownCloud resumed the automatic upload over the cellular network instead of just stop the upload and wait for a Wi-Fi connection. Environment data for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note II Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.5.7 Server runs 6.0.3

		Hello, I am using 1.5.6 on Nexus 5. The auto retry for photos works fine where if a picture doesn't get uploaded the first time it tries again when it has a connection. However for vidoes it doesn't seem to do the same. When a video failed it never tried again. Can you look into it? Thanks. EDIT: Thanks for all the work! I love this app and ownCloud

		Hello Developers, after upgrading to version 1.5.7 I was at first searching for the upload button. Some moments later I saw something gray in the top area of the window and found it. The buttons are in my case on a dark blue background and dark gray. Please change the colors of these buttons to something visible, maybe &quot;ownCloud Blue&quot;. Thanks in advance.

		Same as for iOS owncloud/ios-issues#101 @rperezb @davivel @masensio Currently you need to go to »Settings« and then »Accounts« and then choose your account. Instead, the account list should be directly in Settings where currently there is only the button for »Accounts«. move the list directly over there make the »Add new account« entry look like the last entry in the list no need for the »Edit« button because deletion is already possible via swipe

		I have a problem with one photo which always gets &quot;Upload failed&quot;. It retries continuously. But, looking at the server, the file is there, and many other duplicates. Let's call the file PANO_123.JPG. On the server, I have multiple copies of the file: PANO_123.JPG PANO_123(1).JPG PANO_123(2).JPG and so on... So, the upload is indeed successful, but for some reason the client marks it as failed and it retries later. I have to clean the InstantUpload folder on my owncloud to prevent taking too much disk space.

		Hi. Thank you for a wonderful app. What I would like added if possible, is the ability to change font size in file lists. The reason is simple: long filenames get truncated and thus makes it harder to know which file is which, especially in similarly named files. Adding a &quot;change font size&quot; setting would allow viewing full names without eclipses. A workaround would be to allow long names spanning multiple rows.

		I've bought it on the Amazon Appstore and it's never updated, contrary to the version on Play. BlackBerry will source its apps from the Appstore, so it would be great if releases could be made on all stores at the same time. Thanks!

		When sharing a picture to owncloud (thus uploading) it's possible to choose the directory destination. Being able to create a new directory in the same dialog would be a really nice feature (without closing it and opening the Owncloud app seperately) . (and for the workflow oriented: enter the directory after being created)

		ownCloud 7 Android App 1.5.7 I noticed pulling down images from my server that the app is not rotating them based on the EXIF data. When viewing the same files from the gallery app on android rotation is working, so the app is the issue not the files.

		Expected behaviour When I share something from Evernote to ownCloud, I'd expect it would create a text file or document with the note contents, or give a meaningful error message, or not be present in the &quot;Share to...&quot; list in the first place.

		I believe there is bug in application somewhere - while large file being uploaded (let's say 90MB) there are random glitches. I've tryed the same file several times and as result I upload stalled on 24%, 29%, 36%.

So I believe this is android application bug. Uploading from browser works, but I believe it's not webdav based. App version 1.5.7, server version 7.0, android 4.4.2 on LG G2 , nginx 0.7.67 .

		This is more of a feature than an issue, but it could be of some relevance to the automatic photo/video uploader. There needs to be a way where we can select a local directory and a remote directroy so that they can be synced either both ways, or just to the remote/local folder (a bit like FolderSync) since if the app wasn't running, then not all my photos/videos would be uploaded and since the app doesn't search for any new media, then they won't be uploaded to the server. It'd be great if this was up in the high priority list, but I know that there may be higher priorities already queued up.

		Expected behavior File is uploaded or an error message is displayed. Actual behavior When using Google Photos app share function, it often does nothing and sometimes the owncloud app just crashes. Uploading the same file, using the share button, from Sony Album app or file commander, owncloud always works. Once it did start working, but failed once the apps had been restarted. Steps to reproduce Launch Google Photos app Select an image, press the share icon and select Owncloud press upload nothing happens, no errors, no network activity, no activity in apache logs. Recent apps show owncloud, and when pressed &quot;The application could not be started&quot; message appears and owncloud closes Repeat with Sony Album app or File Commander and uploading works every time. Environment data Android version: 4.4.2 Google Photos 4.4.3.69327628 ownCloud app version: 1.5.7

		Just experienced an issue with the app when an instant upload of an image (and possibly a video too) is being uploaded with Antivirus enabled on the server end of Owncloud. It appears that the upload is successful and the file is indeed uploaded, but since ClamAv (Clamscan) is scanning the file which might take a while on slow systems, the android app says it has failed. This is probably a timeout issue in my opinion.

		We replaced the globe (aka shuriken) with a more understandable »link« icon. Please update the mobile apps (Android as well as iOS) with that: PNG: https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/core/img/actions/public.png SVG: https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/core/img/actions/public.svg cc @rperezb @MTRichards Except in the navigation bar on iOS – please keep the normal »Share icon« for that instead of using the link (as discussed before).

		Hi, would it be possible to implement a function to auto-download and -sync all files on the cloud or in specific folders, so i don't have to select every file specifically? Sometimes i only have 3g or less, so downloading the files i need either takes forever or doesn't work at all when i need them. It would be nice if i would be able to autosync them while i have wifi and have them on my device when i need them. regards sicjay

		After recently getting the ownCloud app on Android and enabling instant photo upload, I noticed that after taking a picture the app is automatically saving a copy of the picture in the owncloud folder on the phones memory, even though I haven't gone to view/download the photo in the app. Since I take a lot of photos this is just wasting space on the phone. Its also not likely I'm going to use the ownCloud app to view the photo if I can view it from the Android photo app anyway, so there isn't really any reason for them to be there. It would be nice to have the option to disable this if not have it removed as it probably doesn't make sense for a lot of people to do this.

		I'm using an OwnCloud 7.07 server over https. The android app will not allow me to log in. I enter the server details and it shows me 'Connection Established'. After entering credentials and touching 'Connect', the login screen does disappear momentarily. I see the top bar with the 'upload' icon and a loading icon, but no files. Shortly after, I am sent right back to the login screen without any error message. I am using an HTC One M8 with Android KitKat (4.4.2). My owncloud server is running on a non-standard port, but I use DNS to forward it properly. As the 'Connection established' message is shown, I assume this is not part of the issue. Nothing is logged at all on the owncloud server in the owncloud.log or the httpd access_log or error_log.

		Scenario: Being in the Android Gallery and uploading single pictures, you 1. open the image, 2. tab the image, 3. select &quot;Share&quot;, 4. select &quot;ownCloud&quot;, 5. navigate to the desired destination directory, and 6. select &quot;Upload&quot;. Problem: If you do this multiple times, you always need to navigate (5.) AGAIN to the desired directory even if you have multiple files going to the same directory (which is a very common case). Request: Owncloud App should remember the last directory you've uploaded something in using the &quot;Share&quot; functionality and present this directory first (not the root directory).

		Scenario: You have shot a lot of pictures and want to upload all or most of them at once. When selecting UPLOAD in an ownCloud directory the user can choose Files, or Content from other apps When selecting 1. you can browse to your image/picture folder and multiselection is possible. BUT you do not have any thumbnail/preview for the images you select. You first have to figure out this manually by going to the Gallery and write down the file names. Request: It would be VERY helpful to have a preview thumbnail in the files-upload view right next to image files.

		Scenario: You have shot a lot of pictures and want to upload all or most of them at once. When selecting UPLOAD in an ownCloud directory the user can choose Files, or Content from other apps When selecting 2. and choosing &quot;Gallery&quot;, one cannot select multiple files for upload. This is annoying when you have shot a lot of pictures and want to upload most of them at once. Currently you are forced to select Upload-&gt;Content from other apps-&gt;Gallery-&gt;Camera shots-&gt;Picture, for EVERY single picture. And you have to remember which picture you just uploaded and where to continue. Dropbox allows multiselection for uploading from the Gallery. Request: It would be nice to have the possibility to select multiple files from other apps like from the Gallery.

		I think the App should have the ability to stream the content instead of downloading it to the device. And for those who wish to download, then there should be an option in the settings to dictate whether or not the user wants to download files to the device or stream it instead. If so, there could even be a download option when long-pressing on the content.

		When I enter the owncloud URL with a trailing slash: https://192.168.0.3/owncloud/ I get an &quot;unknown error&quot; message when hitting the enter button. The Apache2 access log was showing the following entries: 192.168.0.246 - - [01/Sep/2014:20:35:21 +0000] &quot;GET /owncloud//status.php HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 773 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; 192.168.0.246 - - [01/Sep/2014:20:35:21 +0000] &quot;HEAD /owncloud//remote.php/webdav/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 403 681 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; You could see that the HEAD request gets a 403 Forbidden response and the context path was showing a double slash &quot;owncloud//status.php&quot;. After removing the trailing slash the error message went away. The Android App should strip the trailing slash so that the user does not get confused by this kind of error.

		In the database found under &quot;/data/system/users/0/accounts.db&quot; the owncloud password is stored as plain text. This means anyone with root access on the phone, probablly including closed source apps that need root, can aquire the password. This might lead to the discussion that a rooted phone is always a risk, however it would still be nice to add an additional layer of security here.

		When taking a picture with my phone, the image is instantly uploaded to owncloud\SofortUpload, since I got my device set on German. Today I changed the device to French - Pictures now arrive in owncloud\TéléversementInstantané. Maybe some of these options would improve the situation? Stick to a language, when it was already used once. Create a setting value for the name of the directory.

		I am running the android app version 1.5.8. I am running an SSL-enabled owncloud server supported by a CA, that is not in the trusted CA list of my android device, so I had to manually accept the certificate in my owncloud client. I recently updated the certificate on my server to a new certificate by the same CA. I noticed that the file listing on my android client wasn't updated anymore. When trying to manually update the list, I get a busy icon for less than a second, but my file list doesn't update. No warning message was shown in the user interface. After I set the password for this account again (which wasn't changed), I got a certificate warning message again. After having accepted the new certificate here, I could again use my owncloud account. I assume that if the server certificate doesn't match, the connection is silently dropped and no warning is shown to the user. I suggest to show the certificate warning dialog here again instead of silently dropping the connection. @eriktews I (@rperezb) edit your issue to have a better tracking of the scope and expectations: STEPS: Having a ssl self signed cert installed on the ownCloud server Install the Android app and log in accepting the cert From the server side, change the cert Do any action on the Android app such as refresh CURRENT STATUS: The app stop working, every request to the server fails EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR: When this change is detected, we will show a similar popup to the one shown when you accept the cert for the first time This is detected when the current folder is refreshed, similar behavior to the case when the credentials have changed if any upload fails due to the change of the certificate the error shown will be: connection error NOTE: It has been reported on #1420 #1463 and #1515

After that, however, the ownCloud android client was constantly complaining about a &quot;failed synchronisation&quot; for the instant upload images. Also when navigating inside the owncloud app, even though some folder content was shown, it seemed to be outdated, as of most folders the subfolders (especially those I had never loaded before) were empty, and the spinner on the top never stopped turning (even for the folders where some content was shown). Is there any log to check for the case when such problems happen? I tried setting the password multiple times, I'm sure it was the correct one, it never worked I then tried removing the account and recreating it, which also didn't change anything. Next I tried &quot;force stopping&quot; the app and removing all its data, which also didn't help. At last, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the client (and the JellyBean workaround app, which still seems to be required on 4.4, correct?), and after recreating the account then, it finally worked again. Anybody else seen this? Any log or so I can check for details as to why the simple password change procedure didn't work in my case? Note: I didn't specifically check the version before reinstalling, but since automatic upgrades are enabled, I suppose it was the version 1.5.8 of the app before and after re-installation. I'm currently trying a second password change to see if this behavior is reproducible in my environment. Edit: Not reproducible at the moment. So I'm closing this issue. Maybe it will be a guidance for others having a similar experience...

		For people with low memory on their phones, or with new phones that can record in 4K (large files) it would be nice if it was possible to - instead of saving the data on the phone, directly send them to the Owncloud server and then delete the file from the phone as soon as the upload was successful, and only then. As it is today you first have to delete the &quot;misc folder&quot; and then the actual file if you have low memory. The proposed enhancement would do everything for you instead. CC @davivel

		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud/android/master/SETUP.md When importing am I suppose to check copy into workspace or use from the location where I git cloned the owncloud/android project. I want to avoid any future conflicts because of git or Eclipse. And Open Eclipse and create new &quot;Android Project from Existing Code&quot;. should really be changed to something like Open Eclipse and import. Create new creates a new project there is no creating Android Project from Existing Code. You can only import existing code. Thanks.

		I am using the android client (v.1.5.8 from f-droid) on a Samsung Note 8 (android v. 4.2.2) and I am trying to keep some pdf files in sync. I expect files to automatically syncronize to the server after I add annotations or highlights, i.e. files should be uploaded soon after they are modified. However, this does not happen, not even if I force a sync tapping on &quot;Refresh account&quot;. When I check the modification time of the pdfs using a file browser, I can see the modification time is older than the one shown in the client. The only workaround I found is (1) to manually force a sync by long tapping the file and then choosing &quot;Refresh file&quot; or (2) to force the sync of another file in the same folder as in (1), then the other files are uploaded after I modified them (this seems to work consistently, at least as far as I could test) I don't have similar problems with other types of files, for instance text files are uploaded immediately after modification. Also there is nothing suspicious in owncloud.log on the server.

		UPDATE: Seems to be a general Android issue not necessarily due to Owncloud. I have problems with Owncloud on my Nexus 5. Whenever I listen to music and owncloud tries uploading a foto my music stops playing. I am not sure if it only happens when the upload fails or in general when uploading but it is really annoying!

		The app should show a list of already-existing files in the upload window. This will provide additional context for where the user is in the directory hierarchy, reducing the complexity of the required mental model. It may also help the user decide if they want to upload the file or not (e.g. if they see that there will be a conflict). I should point out that Dropbox and (IIRC) Google Drive do this.

		Due to the recent poodle exploit I disabled SSLv3 in my apache configuration. Unfortunately after that uploading files doesn't work anymore with the OC Android client. Steps to reproduce: Having these lines in the apache virtual host configuration works: SSLCipherSuite ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS
SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:!RC4+RSA:+HIGH:-MEDIUM:+EXP:+eNULL:-SSLv2:SSLv3
 Disabling SSLv3 like this will not work: SSLCipherSuite ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH+3DES:DH+3DES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS

		The protocol activity allows to send the log via mail (cf. LogHistoryActivity.java). However, it explicitly uses Gmail. Source code looks like this: // Explicitly only use Gmail to send
intent.setClassName(&quot;com.google.android.gm&quot;,&quot;com.google.android.gm.ComposeActivityGmail&quot;);
 Why should owncloud do that? There are other mail clients around, which people use. And even worse, if Gmail is not available, owncloud crashes: 10-29 07:54:24.445: I/ActivityManager(31009): START u0 {act=android.intent.action.SEND_MULTIPLE typ=text/plain flg=0x10000001 cmp=com.google.android.gm/.ComposeActivityGmail (has clip) (has extras)} from pid 32649

 I would use Android's chooser to let the user choose which mail app to use (if there is no default). If no one objects, I'd issue a PR. @davivel @jancborchardt PS: The send mail option is still in develop branch only.

		This issue is meant to discuss improvements in the Android Client. I posted a workaround before, little bit like a wake up call to that many users request one thing, but nothing happens. This is purely a discussion, and nothing else. It´s not personal against anyone either. I just want to make it clear what is missing, and what would improve the client - a lot. PR´s are more than welcome. As I see it today we are missing or could improve: Photos and videos gets downloaded and is stored both in the regular photos folder of the phone in DCIM, and also by ownCloud client in &quot;Misc&quot;. #588 #592 #640 #601 #346 #156 #375 When a photo or video is taken and fails, it should retry again. #340 #646 Add a delay for Instant Uploads so you have time to delete the photos you don´t want before they get uploaded to the server. #643 A &quot;smart upload&quot; that get´s information from server and don´t upload it if there already is a copy, or upload it once more and overwrite the old file, or make a new copy, and only one copy in that case. #554 Only upload when phone is charging. #465 Two-way sync. #3 Browse the pictures without downloading them, instead - get the information from the server directly. #588 Delete the picture from phone (DCIM folder) after it have successfully been uploaded. #588 This is what my workaround fixes. But it should not have to be a workaround, it should be native, in the original ownCloud app. New suggestions: Download a folder - this is quite nice as people might have 100 mp3s in one folder for example. (Thanks @wakeup) ______________ Questions to begin with: Why haven´t this been prioritized before? What obstacles is present to make this happen? Why is this bad ideas design-wise? Why is so many users not being listened to? My intentions are good, and have always been. I spend 95% of my free time on/with ownCloud, of course I want to make it better but right now it feels like there are many different ways to deal (or not deal) with these issues. Could we please talk it through? CCing all that could be interested in this: @jancborchardt @davivel @lukeowncloud @stefan-niedermann @tobiasKaminsky @owncloud/designers

		Currently we can add multiple accounts to android app, but assuming we have two instances of ownCloud as follows: ipaddress/oc ipaddress/owncloud if we have the same username on both instances, it does not let us set up an account and shows a warning of &quot;same username on same server&quot;. However, they are different instances. It would be good if this could be enabled.

			<description>
		Expected behaviour When you first launch the owncloud app it should determine the InstantUpload directory name and remember that setting. Actual behaviour It looks like that the owncloud app always determines the directoy on launch. If you switch system language in between then the upload will upload to a different directory next time. i.e. if the system language was english all the pictures were uploaded to InstantUpload, when switching to german all pictures after the switch are uploaded to SofortUpload. I think keeping the original directory name is easier on the user. At least I was suprised when it happend. Steps to reproduce On an ownclient install that already uploaded picture. Switch the android system language. The next pictures are uploaded a different directory. Environment data Android version: 4.4.2 Device model: Elephone P2000 Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.6.1 ownCloud server version: 7.02

		Hello, I am preparing a pull request for displaying users's quota used/left. To do so I created a new RemoteOperation copying the GetRemoteUserNameOperation available. However, I am continuously getting 400 Bad Response back from the server, while with a simple Curl everything works nice and smooth. Since with a basic inspection of the headers I couldn't figure out I sniffed my own packets with Wireshark and found the problem: Working request: http://en.zimagez.com/zimage/rightreq.php Non working request: http://en.zimagez.com/zimage/wrongreq.php If you want to try it out we have a server up and running at 54.77.93.38 user/pass = demo demo . And finally here is the code I used: curl that works: curl -H &quot;Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpkZW1v&quot; http://54.77.93.38/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/demo Java code that doesn't   private static final String OCS_ROUTE =&quot;/ocs/v1.php/cloud/users/&quot;;

   String url = client.getBaseUri() + OCS_ROUTE + credentials.getUsername();
   get = new GetMethod(url);
   get.addRequestHeader(createAuthenticationHeader(credentials));
   get.setQueryString(new NameValuePair[]{new NameValuePair(&quot;format&quot;,&quot;json&quot;)});
   status = client.executeMethod(get);

private Header createAuthenticationHeader(OwnCloudCredentials credentials){
    Header h = new Header();
    h.setName(&quot;Authorization&quot;);
    String authString = credentials.getUsername()+&quot;:&quot;+credentials.getAuthToken();
    String encodedString = Base64.encodeToString(authString.getBytes(), **Base64.DEFAULT**);
    h.setValue(&quot;Basic &quot;+encodedString);
    return h;
}
 The problem are these extra termination characters added that obviously screw everything up. I have no knowledge of the apache commons httpclient, but Google didn't return any known issue. EDIT: I found the problem. the Android Base64.DEFAULT appends a \n to the end of the string. You must use the .NO_WRAP flag

		I'm new to Owncloud, I looked for thi bug in the issues but didn't find it. Hope not to generate a duplicate. When I try to upload to Owncloud a file from a different app (like Ghost commander or Download), it doesn't work, no error is generated. The correct sequence is this: I select the file in the other app I tap the share button I choose to share to owncloud app A pop up tree of the ownclud directory appears, I choose the directory where I want to upload the file I tap on the &quot;upload button&quot; nothing happens. If I look in the owncloud web app, the log doesn't show anything, so I suppose is something happening in android, not regarding the server. On the other side, uploading a file directly through the owncloud app, works.

		Expected behaviour I select a file to be my &quot;favorite&quot; and it gets stored on my android device. When I update the file from within android, it is updated on server (working good). When I update the file from within the server, it is updated on the client at next Network-Connect-Event or periodically when connection exists. Actual behaviour When I update the file from within the server, it is not automatically updated on the android-client (unless I open the owncloud app manually). Steps to reproduce set file as favorite and close owncloud app edit file on server disconnect and reconnect Wifi Environment data Android version: 4.4.4 Device model: Nexus 5 Stock or customized system: Android Stock ownCloud app version: 1.6.1 ownCloud server version: 7.0.3

For a brief moment I see (2), then the load animation is shown, afterwards photo (1) is displayed. What should happen? Switching the screen off and on should not affect the currently displayed photo.

		I just learned about Android -&gt; Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Owncloud -&gt; Sync Files. Now I am wondering, what does it do? After enabling it, on my device it synced for 15 minutes. Now the complete index seems to be loaded. Is that what it does? If I understand right, the starred files should also be somehow involved, right? Cf. #726 (comment) How often is this sync performed when this option is enabled? PS: I know this is not a bug. If there is a better place to post this question please tell me!

		When choosing &quot;Sync account&quot; from the drop down menu syncing makes the owncloud app respond very slow. Same is true when syncing is active under Android -&gt; settings -&gt; account -&gt; owncloud (is probably just the same?) Once I could not open a folder at all when sync was in progress (could not reproduce though). Usually switching directories is just veeery slow. Device: Nexus 4 &quot;develop&quot; branch Logcat is full of entries showing which files are updated.

		When opening the details view of a file when NOT coming from the file list view (FileDisplayActivity) but for example clicking on the upload success notification or by calling:         Intent showDetailsIntent = new Intent(this, FileDisplayActivity.class);
        showDetailsIntent.putExtra(FileActivity.EXTRA_FILE, ocFile);
        showDetailsIntent.putExtra(FileActivity.EXTRA_ACCOUNT, file.getAccount(this));
        startActivity(showDetailsIntent);
 I determined that part of the delay is resulting from FileDisplayActivity.onResume() which refreshes all files in the current directory. However, for displaying just a single file this is not necessary. @davivel Should the details view better be separated from the file list?

		When uploading a file using the Android app the file creation date is set to the upload date. Instead, the file creation date of the file from the Android file system should be used. EDITED by @davivel: the creation date of the file suffers an ancient bug, not sure if fixable; BUT the MODIFICATION DATE of the file should be set with the upload.

Details: I renamed FileUploader to FileUploaderService because it is now much more than a simple uploader but a real service; this should be reflected in the name, I think. I reused the DbHandler and called it UploadDbHandler (the old name was a little misleading). Further I replaced some Intent KEYS which where ints with enums (e.g., LocalBehaviour in FileUploadService). This avoids using untyped KEYS and will help avoiding mistakes. OCFiles is now serializable as it is stored persistently. ConnectivityActionReceiver is now responsible for detecting connectivity changes. It calls FileUploaderService. Due to these changes, the branch reliable_uploads is a little bloated. But actually there is not much new there.

		I think it would be nice to add the build date next to the version number in the preferences view. What do you think? It could be done like this: Replace try block around line 266 Preferences.java in with:            try {
               ApplicationInfo ai = getPackageManager().getApplicationInfo(getPackageName(), 0);
               ZipFile zf = new ZipFile(ai.sourceDir);
               ZipEntry ze = zf.getEntry(&quot;classes.dex&quot;);
               long time = ze.getTime();
               String buildDate = DisplayUtils.unixTimeToHumanReadable(time);
               zf.close();
               pkg = getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(getPackageName(), 0);
               pAboutApp.setSummary(String.format(getString(R.string.about_version), pkg.versionName) + &quot; build on &quot; + buildDate);
           } catch (IOException e) {
               Log_OC.e(TAG, &quot;Error while showing about dialog&quot;, e);
           }catch (NameNotFoundException e) {
               Log_OC.e(TAG, &quot;Error while showing about dialog&quot;, e);
           }
 Of course the string &quot; build on &quot; has to be internationalized!

		As part of the reliable uploads enhancement (cf. #762) I introduced a list showing all uploads (scheduled, active, done, failed_retry, failed_give_up, paused) Currently it looks like this (just a draft): Now, how should it look like? In detail, What file/upload details should be visible? (currently: local path, upload state, time of upload request [missing: file size, preview icon]) What main menu items do we need? (currently: Clear list and retry uploads) What file menu options are required? (currently none) What should a click on an upload item do? (currently: if DONE: open details, if FAILED or SCHEDULED: retry) @jancborchardt A penny for your thoughts!

		Hi, I just upgraded my Nexus 4 via OTA to Android 5.0 Lollipop. Now I'm unable to sync my owncloud account using the Android app. When I hit &quot;Refresh account&quot; the app just crashes. I already reinstalled the app - same behaviour. Login to my Owncloud7 instance using HTTPS works fine and I can list files in my directories. Just sync is somehow broken...

Context from other apps implies that the behavior here will be that selecting something in the left pane will open a preview on the right, but instead what happens is that the image is opened full-screen. Instead, a preview should be shown in the right pane and if tapped, then the image should be opened full-screen as we currently do it.

		Why does owncloud app come with a media player for audio and video? It would make sense if media was streamed. But currently it is downloaded and then played. These files can be played with any player, cf. #775 Making a good movie player is out of scope for the owncloud app which is supposed to sync files. Currently the movie player does not work well: Movie starts over when turning device, when clicking on movie error is shown and movie stops, white background is annoying, no full screen, ... I propose to drop the movie player (which is the same as the audio player?).

		I copied the content of one OC server to another. The desktop sync client works with the new OC server. But after deleting the old OC account from OwnCloud App (1.6.2) and adding the new one, I am now stuck in an endless loading loop (for about 2 hrs now). Although there were some connections to the server at the beginning of that loading loop, there is now no opened connection to the server. Reinstallation of the app, deleting app cache as well as owncloud folders on sd card did not help. Now when I delete that new account and add an account for the old OC server (which worked before), it also seems to endlessly load. The OC server is running stable version 7.0.3. It contains about 9800 files with a size of around 16 GB in that specific account. There are no specific errors or warnings logged on the server. EDIT: Just tested with an empty test account and it's the same.

		That would be awesome. At the moment I cannot put a picture from owncloud inside a gallery on my android. Android supports multiple galleries so I think why not have a feature to make any picture folder from owncloud appear in the android gallery? This will make it much easier to integrate pictures into apps, i.E. setting a wallpaper for the texting (SMS) app.

		On Android if I have background data sync enabled for ownCloud it periodically starts a scan to refresh stats on files, but it goes through every file, not just those that have been tagged in the client as ones that should be kept up-to-date. In addition to this, it insists on querying every single god damn file and folder individually, using enormous amounts of data. Since I have thousands of files on my ownCloud-account this takes a long, long time, it keeps the connection open for hours and it consumes several megabytes every single refresh. It should obviously only refresh stats on the files that have been tagged, and even then, it should just send a single request to the server with all the files listed that it wants stats on and the server should just reply with a single response similarly with all the stats for the requested files.

		I just bought the Android ownCloud app (v1.6.2) for my HTC Desire 200 (Android version 4.1.2) and I have an issue. I can seemingly login, meaning that I don't get an error message on my phone. But no files show up and when I try to upload something, I get the error &quot;Upload failed, you need to relogin&quot;. Then I get to login screen, where logging in doesn't help. I just see the empty file list again. The log file of ownCloud (v7.0.3+dfsg-1 on Debian Jessie) shows errors: {&quot;app&quot;:&quot;core&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Login failed: 'adrian' (Remote IP: '192.168.2.149', X-Forwarded-For: '')&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-12-09T11:37:40+00:00&quot;}
 This line appears multiple times. Sometimes four times, sometimes eight times.

		Hello good owncloud peoples! While I was testing the Android app for writing up the manual page, I encountered this issue: the user menu only appears in landscape mode on my tablet. This is what I see in portrait mode: No matter how I I swipe or poke the user menu does not drop down in portrait mode. However, in landscape mode it appears automatically: This behaves the same way in the Dolphin and Firefox Web browsers. I don't know if it does this on other Android devices because I only have one. ASUS Memopad 8, K00L Android version 4.2.2 kernel version 3.0.36

		Hi, I am using the ownCloud Android App version 1.6.2 and I would like to know if you could include support for EC-based ciphers, I am particularly interested in stop supporting SHA1. See closed issue for mirall (owncloud/client#764) implemented in 1.7.1. I am running apache and I have the following directives: SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3 SSLCipherSuite ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES+SHA384:ECDH+AES+SHA256:DH+AES:!RSA+AES256:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5:!DSS:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP SSLHonorCipherOrder on These directives allow you to use cyphers that support forward secrecy and work with a wide range of clients. In my apache log using Android-ownCloud 1.6.2 I get: [15/Jan/2015:12:18:46 -0500] 192.168.1.16 - TLSv1.2 DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA However, I would like to avoid using SHA1, and when I include the following directive in the SSLCipherSuite :!SHA1 the Android-ownCloud stops working. This is a paid app and the new ciphers have been implemented in the Windows and Mac clients for sure. I would greatly appreciate it if you could update the Android-ownCloud as well.

		This kind of a follow-up on #639: I have some folders on my owncloud that contain a bunch (&gt;100) media files. Some (far less than 50 %) of them are also downloaded to my mobile phone. In some situations where I don't have any or not sufficient internet connectivity or don't want to waste data volume but want to watch a video or listen to some audio file I browse through those folders on my device to find something suitable. At the moment, I have to scroll through the file list and keep track of the small green arrows that indicate that the file was downloaded. As I can only access the files on the device in that situation, it would be convenient if I could just sort the files by their status, i.e. files that are stored on the device before those that aren't and therefore have all the available files in one bunch.

			<description>
		Running on a Samsung Galaxy Express (GT-I8730) running Android 4.4.4, with v1.6.2 of OwnCloud app, and connecting to latest version of Owncloud 7, with encryption plugin active. I find that if I set the instant upload directory to an ordinary (ie local) directory then it works ok, but on an external share, it continually tells me the upload has failed, then tries again later. In fact, the upload is not failing - I end up with multiple copies of the image in the selected directory with an incrementing number in brackets after the file name. (The files all seem to be the same size, and to open correctly, so I am assuming that they do in fact contain all data.) The external directory is an Amazon S3 bucket. It may be relevant that rather than using Owncloud's external share setup, I have the bucket mounted as part of the local filesystem using the s3 fuse driver (I was not able to get the S3 external storage working through Owncloud's interface).

		When uploading a photo or video, the OC app, stores that photo as &quot;downloaded&quot; in its cache directory instead of linking the existing file, thus obtaining file duplications: original photo and OC &quot;downloaded&quot; photo. Also if upload fails several times, it gives up uploading it. Especially if the file is large (over 100 MB). I recommend the OC app should sync the camera folder instead of the current behavior.

		I used the Android app to rename a directory from &quot;Photo's&quot; to &quot;Afbeeldingen&quot;. After I did this all subdirectories and images in that directory were gone. At least they are no longer visible in the android app. They are still present in the webinterface and the native client on linux also has no issues seeing the images. This was a scary moment ! I managed to force the android app to rescan the renamed directory by adding another image to it via the owncloud directory on my linux box. When the android app got notified of this new image it also rediscovered my other images and subdirectories. Android app version 1.6.2 Owncloud server installation: 7.0.2 on Centos 6

		In my issue report #876, I reported a bad behaviour of the client. I mentioned a &quot;second step&quot; as a work-around for this. The current implementation of the client if more file oriented. I have to download single files, mark singles files to stay in sync und upload single files is modified. To make ths a little bit more handy, the client should allow the upload of all modified files within a directory (from it's global menu). It isn't funny to manually sync / upload a couple of files by opening the context menu of each modified file. ;-) IMO it is worth thinking about an configuration option, where the user is able to choose between &quot;manually upload modified files&quot;, or &quot;automatically upload local changes&quot;.

		Hi, in order to distinguish between an real app problem or &quot;just&quot; a server side problem we should include a new question in the issue_template.md: Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? Please log in with: User: test / password: test / url: https://demo.owncloud.org Also we (or maybe /core) should try to write a test script that checks if the server is working fine. So many bad ratings on the play store would vanish as they are not related to the app but to the mis-configured server. (Apart to e.g. dropbox this is a problem as the user does not distinguish between server or app failures. But we cannot be made responsible for wrong servers... Maybe this should also be mentioned somewhere...)

		ownCloud for Android stores the local copy of the files in public storage. That allows that other apps in the device may access the downloaded files with no other special permission than access to the file system. The advantage of this approach is providing an extra way to share files with other apps. The drawback is that other apps may modify the files of the account with no barrier or control from the ownCloud app, what may result in security issues, We are planning to start using private storage instead. The lack of access though the file system will be a limitation for regular file browsers, but there are still other means to get access to the ownCloud files from other apps. Besides, we should also implement the DocumentProvider API to provide the newest and safer. Our main concern about this change is how the current users will receive it. We'd like to read opinions here to get an idea. How would you see that the app directly moves the current ownCloud folder to private storage? Would you prefer it as an optional setting, or as a mandatory option? cc @jancborchardt @MTRichards @rperezb @tobiasKaminsky @lukeowncloud @MMMarcy @stoyicker and any other who wants to join the discussion.

		Android client does not respect the same protocol as the desktop client for chunked uploads. For chunked PUT the client should send the OC-Total-Length header specifying the total file size (like the desktop sync client does). This gives a server a possibility, for example, to check the final file size as an integrity check. You may check with @dragotin and @DeepDiver1975 for details. BWT, we started drafting the spec. It is not yet finalized: https://github.com/cernbox/smashbox/blob/master/protocol/protocol.md You may also check if issues with failing 1MB+ uploads (e.g. #402) are not related.

		Storage is limited. Sooner or later the space on the android device gets low. The user needs help for the desicision: Which parts should not be synchronized in the future, to save disk space? On the unix shell I use this: du -a | sort -rn | less Example output of above command on the unix shell: root@pc&gt; du -ax /etc/ | sort -rn | head
36156   /etc/
18724   /etc/X11
18156   /etc/X11/core
3972    /etc/brltty
1700    /etc/apparmor.d
 This lists the biggest entries first. If you have a list like this, it's easy to find the stuff to delete/stop-to-sync. I think the best place would be in the context dialog of a directory. For example &quot;Show disk usage statistic&quot; could be the heading of this new feature. I can't help you to implent this by writing code. But if you need feedback on usability: just contact me. I love to help you.

		Hey Guys, I've got a suggestion for another feature. If you take a photo and you have instant upload on, than the photo gets uploaded immediately. If the picture is blurred it gets uploaded anyway and wastes your limited mobile internet access. So if there is an option to delay the upload maybe one or two minutes, you have enough time to check the picture, delete it and take a new needle-sharp one and you save a lot of traffic.

		Hello, I'm trying to access a OC server through a federated infrastructure. When trying to connect to a server at the following address: https://cana.imd.ufrn.br/oc-shib I get the following error message of the app: &quot;Cannot authenticate against this server&quot; Accessing through a browser is all normal. As well as in the desktop client that shows the page to choose the Idp and , since the IDP is selected, your login page appears , once authenticated I have access to my files. The problem is access through the android client. Analyzing the source code, I note that The mAuthTokenType variable in AuthenticatorActivity class is definied for &quot;owncloud.password&quot;, but the authentication method identified is SAML_WEB_SSO. So the authSupported method (in line 1065) returns false, generating the message &quot;auth_can_not_auth_against_server&quot;. On the other hand. When the auth_method_saml_web_sso(in steup.xml) is definied to &quot;on&quot;, the mAuthTokenType value is definied to &quot;owncloud.saml.web_sso.session_cookie&quot;. Thus the app shows only the server url field, and when I input the url, a webView dialog is shown, loading the page to the IDP choosing page. But when I interact with it, it crashes and the application returns to the initial screen. Apparently the value of mAuthTokenType is definied during startup(line 219) and is no longer modified. Even when the authentication method identified is the SAML_WEB_SSO. Why is this happening? federated authentication is actually supported by app? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.

		Steps Upload file &quot;test.txt&quot; directly to server Open Android client Pick &quot;Keep in sync&quot; for that file and wait for download Go offline (airplane mode) In the web UI, change &quot;test.txt&quot; and save 6 On mobile (still offline), edit &quot;test.txt&quot; too and save Go back online Long press on &quot;test.txt&quot; and pick &quot;Refresh file&quot; At this point you get a dialog that says: &quot;Remote file &quot;test.txt&quot; is not synchronized with local file. Continuing will replace content of file on server&quot; with three buttons: &quot;Don't upload&quot;, &quot;Keep both&quot; and &quot;Overwrite&quot;. I want to overwrite the local file, so should I pick &quot;Don't upload&quot; or &quot;Overwrite&quot; ? Does &quot;Overwrite&quot; mean &quot;Overwrite server file&quot; or &quot;Overwrite local file&quot; ? &quot;Don't upload&quot; could also mean &quot;Do not overwrite server version but overwrite local version&quot;. This is very confusing and even scary as I'm afraid to lose the wrong changes. Also the dialog mentions &quot;continuing&quot; but there is no &quot;continue&quot; button. How about changing the labels to &quot;Use local version&quot;, &quot; Use server version&quot; and &quot;Keep both&quot; or something more explicit ? To be discussed with @owncloud/designers

		Whenever I use &quot;Refresh account&quot; there is a notification &quot;Conflicts found&quot; that appears in the notification bar of Android. Tapping it doesn't do anything. I still have no idea what file is causing the conflict. Some suggested changes: Add the name of the file in the notification (but could be a problem if many files) Tapping the notification should open the client in the folder with the conflicts, scrolled down to the file in question I realize that this might not work when more than a single file has conflicts. But redirecting to the first one would already help a lot. I could then solve it then refresh again, then tap the notification to go to the next conflict. (that would be the quick fix) That or... a special dialog/list with the conflict files ? I hope one day I'll discover which one of my files is the one with conflict. I checked all folders and there is no file with &quot;(2)&quot; so I cannot find where it is... @owncloud/designers

		Hello, I would like to add a new option: Instead of copying files during upload it should also be possible to move them. Imagine this scenario: I have a lot of old images I would like to get off my phone to owncloud. Currently: open owncloud add photos in gallery: select the same photos and delete them With the new option these photos will be moved from e.g. DCIM to the owncloud folder (and as we have the update of media library they are still accessible by gallery. So there is no change for the user. After the successful upload the user can select the folder and delete it locally. Optional there should also be a setting to delete the files directly after successful upload. This will simplify the steps again. What do you think? @davivel @masensio @jancborchardt

		Hello Thanks To D Molkentein for closing Desktop client ref #3025 So using the Android ownCloud client to upload photos to the server - absolute godsend but have decided to create an SSH Server on the android device and scp - However - using the SSH session on Android device I noticed some overhangs of ownCloud that could be better - for storage efficiency on the client device The original files in DCIM were still there (expected) But a duplicate copy of the uploaded file was stored in the owncloud &quot;virtual area&quot; (/owncloud/username@owncloudHostHASH/PhotoArea1/PhotoArea2. Is this normal? If I go ahead remove the files from the owncloud area on the device (to free up space) will this remove process sync on the server? (Believe not) Apart from using SSH session on the phone to bulk remove- is there an automated routine in the ownCloud client to purge these surplus copies from the device after they have been uploaded ? Or plans to? Or do we need to create internal housekeeping mechanisms to purge these files? Thanks

		It would appear that when using ownCloud Android client version 1.7.1 when trying to download files that were uploaded with the web interface I get a &quot;Download failed&quot; every time. However, if I use the URL in a mobile browser and log in and download, it works fine. I have no errors in the log files on the server. This leads me to believe it is an application problem. I would love to provide more information, if someone can give me an idea of what to provide.

		Hi, I've just moved from my Samsung S4 with stock camera to oneplus one with several camera Apps: &quot;Kamera&quot;, Focal Google &quot;Kamera&quot;. Only the Google Kamera App seems to trigger an owncloud upload. But all trigger a Google Picture Backup-Upload. I understand that the apps might not send the correct broadcast (as in issue #760), but could you please think about an option in owncloud to enable something like a Poll of the Camera Folder to check for new files? (any file, don't be smart and ignore files you don't think are worth it) Like in Issue #6 the FolderObserver class could be a way. This is really the whole purpose why I bought the official app - please improve it! Thanks, Michael

		Hi, I find the MOVE operation does not work well on my phone. When I move one file in one folder to another,it will delete the file in source folder and the file shows up in one sec in destination folder,then it disappears.Also,I cannot find the file at my account in website. My owncloud android version is 1.7.1 and owncloud server version is 8.0.2. I use Openstack Swift as back end storage. Looking forward to your solution! Thanks!

		I noticed a couple of days ago that my phone started to drain the battery very fast and using a program to trace which programs are using wakelocks, I found that the owncloud syncing was responsible, making my phone never entering in deep sleep. I had to disable syncing, otherwise my battery lasts close to nothing. Not too long ago I added some external folders to my owncloud server with a lot of files (~67K files). I wonder if that could trigger this problem (but I think I noticed this problem in my phone a few days after I added the files to the server). A simple way to see if these 2 events are related would be to exclude the new external folders from the syncing, but I can't find any option to select which folder to sync, as you can do with the (linux) desktop app.

			<description>
		Are there any plans to create a sync API that can be used by other apps (similar to the [dropbox API[(https://www.dropbox.com/developers/sync)), or is there maybe such a thing already for Android? What I would like to achieve is being able to upload files from another app to ownCloud. Do you maybe have any tips/recommendations on how to best achieve this? From a quick research on the source code here and a search for WebDAV libraries for Java I doubt it, but is there maybe a simple way to do this generically for WebDAV via some library? I know this is not really an issue with the app, but I think this is still the best place to ask this question (considering that the android devel mailing list appears to be empty). Sorry if this is not the right venue to ask this, and thanks in advance for any pointers!

		A new feature I would suggest: I use in Android Blacloud.de to sync my photos to my owncloud I would prefer if Instant upload folder doesn't get created in Android phone with photos taken by the camera. This create duplicated photos in my phone. Then I have the same photos in the gallery and in the Instant upload folder created by Blacloud.de Rather is the client for android sync all photos taken by my phone from the phone gallery to the Owncloud Please no &quot;Instant upload folder&quot;

		There are some problems with routers that don't have NAT-Loopback if you want to upload/connect to your self-hosted owncloud. Example case: Owncloud local network (ip 192.168.1.100) Owncloud global dns example.com (ip 90.50.100.30 ) if you want to connect over wifi (local network) to your owncloud and use example.com as url to it, then it will try to connect to 90.50.100.30 and it wont work. NAT-Loopback would lookup which ip you have and remap it to you local ip. Is there a possibility to get Advanced settings, on app side, where I can set the SSID (Wifi name) and the local ip to be able to connect through Wifi if I am connected to it? I saw that on another app called Transdrone (see screenshots attached). What do you guys think?

		Quite often i want to share a bunch of images from my phone. For that i select (say) 10 photos using my viewer application, and then 'share' with owncloud. Typically i would create a new directory there to put my photo in. This seems (to me) a pretty common way of doing. Currently it is not possible. You have to first (using the phone or the browser on your desktop compuer) create the directory, then goes back to the image viewer and upload them (and usually you're hit by #198 , but it's another issue)

		I just installed opencloud8 and the android app and I find it works well, but… I can't find a good way to synchronise existing pictures without uploading them manually, either one by one or with file upload, meaning I have to select each file manually. It would be nice if the client could sync the entire gallery. Is this behaviour planned? Best regards roy

		When my camera app snaps a picture it ends up in the DCIM folder and the Owncloud app uploads it which is all fine and dandy but why on earth does the owncloud app copy the photo to SD/owncloud/user@host/InstantUpload before it gets copied to the owncloud server? Having duplicates of all my photos takes up valuable storage.

		Hi, first of all: I already wrote an email to the developers, but for tracing, I'm opening this issue. What I have: OwnCloud 8.0.3 on Linux Android app v1.7.1 Android 5.0.2 Nexus 6 Owncloud settings (sharing, number of checkbox order in braces): allow share api (1) allow to share links (2) NOT force password (3) NOT allow public upload (4) allow users to send email notifications (5) set default date (6): 1 day -&gt; do NOT force date allow re-sharing (7) do NOT restrict to groups (8) allow users to send email notifications (9) do NOT restrict to groups (10) What I did (app): choose account: one user, one admin browse to a folder or file select &quot;share link&quot; select app to share (tried with email and others) What then happens: sometimes message appears &quot;you have no permissions to share this file&quot; sometimes a password input dialog appears if the dialog appears: Can't leave the pw blank -&gt; fails (you have to enter a password) if I select &quot;cancel&quot; -&gt; nothing happens if I enter a password -&gt; you do not have permissions to share this file What I expected: because of the settings at oc I awaited the email app to be opened to share the link: with and/or without password If I can provide you further informations, please let me know. Also it would be possible to provide you a &quot;test&quot; user account at this server instance. Please notice: My app and server is located to germany, so there's a great chance the given messages I provided does not match 1:1 to the orginal messages. I simply tried to translate by myself. Thanks!

		Like many, I use the Instant Upload feature to backup pictures so I can remove the images from my device when it starts to fill up. However, often times I've noticed a failed instant upload is never retried and I've lost images because they weren't in sync with ownCloud. I would love a feature added to the app via a button press that checks for any files in DCIM that are not in the InstantUpload folder and uploads them. Or, if the app works by keeping track of successful uploads, forcing a sync on anything not marked as successful. Thanks.

		Hi! I think, the android app should work exactly like the desktop app. All files and folders added to the owncloud folder should be uploaded and synced automatically. Marking single files to be kept in sync is very complicated. And every change made locally on the device should be synced directly, or an option for that should be added. Overall a sync interval should be configurable.

If during some file transfer, my adsl connections drops and reconnect , after a while owncloud client should detect that no data is being transfered, times out and retries. Actual behaviour Client will hang forever in the same progress.

		Expected behaviour The application is able to send a file to another application when pressing the send button of a downloaded file. Actual behaviour At the moment, sending downloaded files directly from the owncloud application does not work. When I press the send Button, for example while viewing a picture in owncloud and choose an e-mail client, the application opens without the picture. It is simply not there. There is just an empty e-mail without any attachments. The same happens when I select WhatsApp or any other application. Steps to reproduce: Select a file Press send Select a random application Environment data Android version: 5.1.1 and 5.0.2 Device model: Nexus 4 and LG L90 Stock or customized system: CM and Stock ownCloud app version: 1.7.1 ownCloud server version: 8.0.3 Logs ownCloud log W/PackageManager(2316): Failure retrieving resources for com.owncloud.android: Resource ID 0x0

		I was wondering why the instant camera uploads feature is so specific and not a more general feature which could upload new files from any of user-defined directories. This kind of syncing functionality is missing and, since instant camera uploads has been implemented, I don't see any reason why not implement multiple directory monitoring and automatic uploading of new files to main server. Kind Regards, George

		In #413 and #8 it was suggested and also partially fixed to show the server's certificate. Example output (current version 1.7.x) 5891524778990fb6b40e3d988260e80192975a22c5529379f8d89d072b2b44ac

 However, it is very difficult to verify the whole certificate and a very unusual method. Therefore I suggest to calculate and display the sha256 fingerprint and, yes, these are deprecated checksums, for user convenience to show also sha1 and md5 checksum of the certificate. Example: sha256  c5:46:51:a8:14:24:dd:ee:64:86:37:7e:d3:a3:a2:5f:51:ca:00:7e:66:74:4c:cd:cd:27:27:78:02:72:40:79

		I know there's a couple of open issues about specific aspects of material design (like the FAB), but this is more geared towards a bigger overhaul. ownCloud's two biggest competitors, Dropbox and Google Drive, are both considered to be &quot;Material Design&quot; apps. Do we want ownCloud to stick with its current UI, which is closest to Dropbox, or should it move to a card layout, like Google Drive? Drive does let you switch between a list view and a grid view, so it's kind of the best of both worlds. Should ownCloud be cards by default, with the option to switch to a list view? I was thinking about doing a more formal poll, but I kind of want to get a feel for the community's opinion on the look and feel/UX of the future of the ownCloud app. As a side note, I think that the app and the web interface should look similar/be cohesive, so there should probably be a parallel effort of moving the web interface to material as well.

		Sometimes, ownCloud 1.7.1 hangs when doing an upload. I have no way of cancel the upload. I need to stop the app via the App manager in order to make it working again. In my case, those hanging uploads sit there forever (I had an upload hanging for 8 hours). It would be good if there was an option to cancel an upload (i.e. tap on the upload notification then see all pending uploads, and a way to cancel the upload).

			<description>
		Hello all, I have posted my issue first in the forum, as I was not sure if I am experiencing a bug or if I am too bad to use the app correctly. It seems to be some buggy behavior. I am using the current Sync App on Samsung S6 (Android 5.0.2) and on server side it is the newest/current ownCloud Server running on Linux Ubuntu. I have two major issues uploading photos to folders I have created. Via the ownCloud App, browsing to the folder and then using the upload function. This is kind of pain in the ***. When browsing the folders, when I choose the Camera, first of all, the photo list is always chronological, I have to go pass thousands of photos before having the ability to select the pictures I want. Also before clicking on &quot;Upload&quot;, I need to way for all thumbnails to be displayed, otherwise the app will break/stop. So uploading one picture can be a matter of 5 minutes just wainting that thumbnails are built up.. Via the image library and adding images to albums I am not sure if this is an ownCloud feature. But in the image library I can select &quot;Add to album&quot; after selecting one or more photos. I discovered this quite late ;-) As there is no recognition symbol to ownCloud, I never paid attention to it. Also what is &quot;bizar&quot;, the album list matches only 50% of the folder I have created on ownCloud, the other half is missing.. Anyways, I have selected 4 pictures and associated them to one of the albums. Now the photos are gone from the image library but are not in the ownCloud folders. They seem to be gone, deleted.. Additional info: While I was looking for the disappered photos and browsing the storage space, I noticed that the owncloud folder has a /tmp folder and a folde named like my account login. Some folders I have created where in the account folder, some others in the /tmp folder. I couldn't find out the logic behind this segmentation... I would be glad to know if the client was designed to be like that or if it is seen as bug and will be enhanced in some next release? Best regards, MW

		Hello all, I use instant upload over wifi. It's working great since you expose your server to the internet. I would like to have more security using vpn. But until I activate the vpn tunnel the sync is already starting and gives error messages about missing IP. I would like to have a delay time after wifi connect for the sync. If possible adjustable. Let's say from 0 to 30 seconds. This would help a lot. Greetings Chucrute

		First to say, I like Owncloud. But I am disappointed that there is no option to logout using the android app. For security reasons, there should be a option to logout when the user choose so. Also, there should be a option to automatically logout, when the device is entering locked mode. When user is logged out, remember server settings, and user name if the user choose this as a option.

		Sometimes an instant upload is failing. If this happens I'm getting an error message which is stating that it failed. But there is no option to retry the upload (or even an option in the settings to automatically retry it after some minutes or so). When I'm clicking on the error message I'm just redirected to the folder in which my pictures should be uploaded. Makes the owncloud app nearly useless for me at the moment because I can't trust that everything is just working.

		I am participating since a quite long time to the android app. But still I have some questions about the develop process. This should not be a rant, I am just curios and want to understand the internal processes better. I do not want to affront somebody. (And of course I am not quitting the development ;) ) How are PR chosen for the next sprint? There are some PRs with huge impact (like #821 or #982), but instead some &quot;minor&quot; PRs are chosen. PRs are getting included too slooooow. ;) The oldest PR is from 11/14. First this may prevent user to create new PRs. But the more important problem is, that updating the PR to the newest develop version is getting more and more complicated (see #821). What prevents you to integrate the PRs faster? Men power? Since the last release the oc devs seem to disappear. There were far less activity and responses. Is the develop process not continuous, but are you working in cycles? And have times where you do not work for the app? Please try to answer my questions :)

		Currently owncloud for android does a TERRIBLE job showing what is happening when there are problems with the network connection. I will show two examples: Right now i &quot;appear&quot; to be connected to my 3g network, but somehow cant connect to anything. If i open owncloud app, and try to refresh some file ( which i have sure it was modified on the server) owncloud will popup a progressbar with &quot;Wait a moment&quot; and a few seconds later the progress will disappear and nothing is done, the file is not downloaded, there are no error messages , just nothing. Even worse, if i try to enter any folder in this condition, i will get : &quot;nothing uploaded here&quot; which is clearly wrong !

		It would be nice to have your uploaded pictures and videos, to be saved in to a folder with the date it was uploaded. I now need to sort through everything in the instant upload folder to find what I'm after. Getting it to read the date stamp of the picture and video and putting in to the date folder would be even better. But I will be happy with the uploaded date folder. Thanks for a great app.

		I use Picasa on my Windows desktop: it creates a special file in each folder called &quot;.picasa.ini&quot;. This file is used to store useful information (people in the pictures, modification, ...). So, IMO, it's useful that ownCloud syncs it. Unfortunately, this prevents the Android app to consider the folder &quot;full of pictures, and only pictures&quot;. As a consequence, the grid view is not shown. Instead of that, we have a file list, with thumbnails and the name of the folders. Would it be possible, for example, to exclude files starting with a point, when the app wants to know if there are only pictures in the folder? Config : Ubuntu 15.04 3.19.0-25-generic Server version: Apache/2.4.10 (Ubuntu) PHP 5.6.4-4ubuntu6.2 (cli) (built: Jul 2 2015 15:29:28) mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.25, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using EditLine wrapper Android ownCloud app: 1.7.2 Android version : 4.2.1 ownCloud server: 8.1.0

		I don't know if it's stated in #894, but the grid setting, when enabled, should be propagated down the tree of files to all descendent folders. If set in root fold, all the children will be shown in grid mode too. Then, if list view is selected for a subfolder, it will applied (and remembered) to that subfolder and all its children. Think in a 3-valued property: &quot;list&quot;, &quot;grid&quot; and &quot;inherited&quot;; the default value for every folder is &quot;inherited&quot;, with the exception of the root folder, where &quot;inherited&quot; makes no sense and is promoted to &quot;list&quot;. The user only can choose in the UI between &quot;list&quot; or &quot;grid&quot;, &quot;inherited&quot; is for internal use. OLD: The threshold was 80%, now it is 100%. I think this should be adjustable as each user may have a different wish. @jancborchardt What do you think? A slider with value? https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/sliders.html#sliders-continuous-slider --&gt; With an editable numeric value

		I need to install two ownCloud android apps on the same device - suppose CloudA and CloudB (different UI for CloudB). After installing CloudA and running successfully on the device, when I try to install CloudB, Eclipse shows INSTALL_FAILED_CONFLICTING_PROVIDER error. I tried by changing 'authorities' name in the manifest but it does not work. What's wrong!!!

		The owncloud app is listed among the apps to share information whenever you choice to share something. However, most of the time the share fails, since the owncloud app does not know how to handle the data. This is really frustrating. The most advantage purpose of having access to the owncloud server on an android device is the point that one is able to add very quickly content.. Owncloud on the go... The Owncloud app should therefore try to handle as much shared data as possible. If there are multiple ways, it could offer a selection. E.g. saving as txt or odt. Furthermore, the settings could define standard saving options. E.g. Save in the folder notes/income/ save as $date-time-app-name. It should be possible to save text, images, videos, links, html, etc. An example how such a saving method could work would be the save dialogs of the firefox webbrowser, where one can simply save as default by a single click or allow customized saving settings.

		In a folder list and in a file list, accentuated letter are not considered properly to sort the folders/files. For example, the letter &quot;e&quot; with accent &quot;é&quot; should be considered as a normal &quot;e&quot;. But a folder or a file starting with &quot;é&quot; is sent to the end of the list, after &quot;z&quot;. Example: Étudiant should be before Radio Fé should be before Fr It's the same for other accentuated letters (I didn't test all of them): í, à, ô, ù, ñ, ...

		This would be a great feature - Syncing the local Calender/Contacts with your OwnCloud account if the app is enabled on the server. This would be a great because I'm sure other people, and not just my self, don't like the idea of downloading third-party applications and would rather prefer an original app from OwnCloud for dealing with sensitive information like this. I know Google use multiple applications, so I'm sure someone will come up with an idea whether to either have an application that does everything (aka OwnCloud), or split it into different apps from OwnCloud, e.g OwnCloud Contacts, OwnCloud Calender, etc.

		I do have the Android Studio installed (but not the stand-alone tools), working with it since a while. I wanted to start OC development and followed the instructions in https://github.com/owncloud/android/blob/master/SETUP.md . However, when running ./setup_env.sh gradle this fails on my machine in line 7 /setup_env.sh: line 7: android: command not found.
 Pls. assist, perhaps something is missing in the instructions, or not present in the PATH. If both the Android Studio and the stand-alone tools are needed, then it may be wise to add such a hint in the SETUP.md.

		If an attacker somehow find themselves in a position to inject script into a WebView, then they could exploit the opportunity to access local resources. This can be somewhat prevented by disabling local file system access. It is enabled by default. The Android WebSettings class can be used to disable local file system access via the public method setAllowFileAccess. webSettings().setAllowFileAccess(false); This restricts the WebView to loading local resources from file:///android_asset (assets) and file:///android_res (resources).

		Setup Guide says Android SDK Build-Tools; any version from 20 or later should work fine; avoid preview versions, if any available. I get following error if I don't have 22.0.1 not installed. I have tried changing compileSdkVersion to 23 and builtToolVersion to 23.0.1 in build.gradle but there is no luck. Although this can be fixed very easily by installing that particular built tool version but I was wondering what's going on here. Do I need a specific version of build tool to import the project? Should I refrain from modifying the build.gradle dependency versions as I might get out of sync with the project? Error:failed to find Build Tools revision 22.0.1

		I have been using owncloud for 9 months or so. Owncloud uploads all pictures and video to my server from the /sdcard/DCIM. Other applications place pictures in /sdcard/DCIM also like Tasker and some others. Would others users like the option to auto upload other directory on the phone or even include sub directories? Thanks you for considering. -Jay

		With the new (material design) implementation buttons can't simply bind java methods via configuration anymore but need to do this is the way we already did it except for one instance in the login screen, when you hit the refresh button (for example when you entered an invalid owncloud url). Bug number 2 (I know this should be separated..) is a UI glitch, or rather two on the login screen: the refresh button is oversized in the landscape mode the hint text has a size glitch when you refresh on an invalid address (spinning icon Vs. warning icon) Unfortunately I don't have the time now to fork/PR but I have the fix already on the other branches for #1090 and #1100 e.g. 044c597 549284e d78077d hopefully I will find the time to open up a PR tomorrow. Update The crash bug isn't present on 1.8/master just on my feature branches. The remaining two issues have been fixed on PR #1163

Maybe it is a good idea to implement a functionality check with (not complete) login thumbnails upload dummy file move dummy file and so on This could be done with a verbose log, which can then be posted directly here, if there is a problem.

		from @joede: Just a stupid question. If other tools like QuickPic can see the images, can these tools delete these files too? If so, what happens to the sync process? Does the ownCloud client sync the deletion of the file? from @tobiasKaminsky: @joede The deletion of the local file on the device is not synced to the server. But I do not know, if the app is noticed about the deletion. I bet that the app tries to open the local file and fails as it is not there OR the app downloads the file again (which is most likely) from @joede: @tobiasKaminsky so the OC app should disallow modifications of the filename and deletions. Is this possible?

		For security, I think 2FA is a must, TOTP should be sufficient. So that a compromised password isn't too big of an issue. Also, would it be possible for the Android and Desktop clients to check the SSL certificate fingerprint? Bassically, in the settings menu it should have a little information about the SSL certificate including the fingerprint. The app should give a warning when anything changed, that way MIT attacks are nearly impossible.

		Currently when downloading multiple files, you often end up with 2 notifications: one for the download in progress, and one for the »success« notification of the previous download: When there is another download coming right after, it is unnecessary to show the success notification. An error notification when something went wrong is enough, and a summary success notification at the end (which of course vanishes like the one currently does.) cc @davivel @masensio @AndyScherzinger @tobiasKaminsky @stoyicker

		Currently when uploading files from other Android apps (like Gallery), only folders of your ownCloud show in the upload popup. But it should also show files – otherwise you might think they are gone. @davivel @masensio @AndyScherzinger @tobiasKaminsky

		Currently in the list the file size floats on the right in free space (looks especially strange for short file names). Instead, it should just be right next to the date, separated with a comma and space from it.

		There are many open issues that are only open as the corresponding PR is not yet merged. But it is hardly to see in the issue overview. So I suggest a new label &quot;resolved by PR/ PR exists&quot; or something that indicates that the issue is only open as long as the PR is not merged. For instance: #1181

		Hi! I run OC 8.1.3 behind an nginx 1.8.0 proxy with php5-fpm and a self signed certificate. The certificate has been imported as a system cert in android for DavDroid. Everything including WebDAV and CalDAV runs find except for the OC android app: Problem: I cannot login due to an unrecognized error. Question: What could the reason be? Is it a bug in the OC app or has it something to do with my selfsigned certificate? I created it using openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout $1.pem -out $1.pem -days 730
 Here's first the ADB log when I add the following HTTP header: Strict-Transport-Security:max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains

		So I looked through the couple issue and PR threads pertaining to the Material redesign, and all I can tell is that at one point in the screenshots the drawer went at least up to the status bar, but then it started stopping at the app bar. Can't seem to find an issue pertaining to this, so... Expected behaviour The drawer goes from the nav bar, or bottom of screen with hardware buttons, to the top of the screen, or at least to the status bar. Actual behaviour The drawer stops at the app bar, almost certainly intentionally Steps to reproduce Open app drawer, using hamburger button or edge swipe. Environment data Android version: 5.1.1 Device model: OnePlus One Stock or customized system: Customized (CyanogenMod instead of Cyanogen OS) ownCloud app version: 1.8.0 ownCloud server version: 8.1 Are logs relevant with intentional behavior? Sorry if this is the wrong place, I wasn't quite sure where this goes.

		In order to pre-test the PRs by the community I suggest to create a public beta in a new branch. There will be an apk, that experienced user can download, install and test. This branch will contains all PRs that are &quot;3 - to review&quot; or above. Issues regarding the beta will get the label &quot;Beta&quot;. Found bugs or improvements are implemented in the corresponding original PRs and merged back to beta. The main advantage of this is, that the PRs are tested by far more user than &quot;only&quot; the QA. Furthermore if the PRs have fewer issues, the workload of the QA should be lower and thus can result in a faster merge process. I am willing to maintain this branch and do a merge if the belonging PRs are changing. What do you think? @davivel @rperezb @jancborchardt @AndyScherzinger @lukeowncloud

		Owncloud's upload will sometimes freeze in the middle of an &quot;Instant upload&quot; if I'm on the edge of my wifi or leaving the house. Then the notification that the upload is 55% (or whatever) just stays there as it is still uploading and it is non-dismissable. It would be nice if this uploading notification was dismissable. If owncloud has not actually sent any data for a minute it should queue it for later.

		Using owncloud-beta-2015-10-30.apk. When choosing &quot;On device&quot; from the side drawer I expect all folders which do not contain any downloaded files to disappear. Instead I still see the whole folder structure. This is confusing to me as a user. Further, there is no indication that currently only files &quot;on device&quot; are shown. Looking at a folder which I know has content but which says &quot;Nothing in here. Upload something!&quot; (string file_list_empty), is even more confusing. Note: Also string local_file_list_empty &quot;There are no files in this folder.&quot; would not help much, either.

Now some thumbnails are shown. Scroll down, scroll up. Thumbnails are gone. Thumbnails are also gone after switching screen off and on again. Note: It seems that after after thumbnails of a folder are loaded, they do not disappear anymore.

		Thank You Tobias for bringing this possibility to share with ownCloud users!! I suppose that You plan to add the options of sharing for files and folders (can share, can edit, access control - create, change, delete), as it is important to be able to set the folder readonly when sharing.. I just wanted to leave the mention that they are missing for now. Thank You sooo muuuchh!!

		Hey all, Took delivery of a Android 6 enabled phone yesterday and put the Owncloud app on it. It does not like it one bit to be honest, frequent black screen / crash and upload is not working. I did notice that at no time was i asked for permissions management, this is new in Android 6 in that permissions are supposed to be requested as an when they are needed rather than at install time via marketplace and i'm wondering if this is to blame (access to storage etc). Anyone else using Android 6 ATM who can confirm?

		I thought that I could use the &quot;View Changelog&quot; menu entry to check which version am I using, but I just noticed that it opens: https://raw.githubcontent.com/owncloud/android/beta/CHANGELOG.mg , which I believe is the changelog for the whole branch. I almost reported an issue using old build (I installed newer build on the phone yesterday, but not on the tablet, and I used the tablet today) Adding some kind of indication to identify the build in the app would be nice. Especially for filtering dumb mistakes like the one I almost made.. 😓

		When I preview the photos in fullscreen and I decide to download the original, the preview gets replaced by the original when the download is finished. That is nice. When I view an original in fullscreen and then decide to delete it, I think, I should be presented with the large preview and stay in fullscreen mode. Do You agree with me?

		I was very happy when You introduced the possibility of using the grid view for all folders as I have many forlders with both documents and pictures or scans. Sometimes I do switch between the views as both have its advantages. When I was using the beta now, I found out that it is a little schizofrenic when EACH folder remembers the last viewing method. Several times I switched to grid view to look for some picture quickly, and I went through several subdirectories. Later I was viewing some of the diretories in list view. After some time I ended up with directories (seemingly) randomly switching between grid and list views as I was going through them. It was kind of.. odd behaviour. I think it would be better to have the grid/list as a mode switch like in other file managers. (When You use Nautilus or anything else, Your view also doesn’t switch from icon to list view as You go through the directory tree). Do You agree with me or do You have a different reason to have the view remembered for each folder?

		When uploading a file from Android (only?) the time and date of the file ist changed to time and date of upload. Is it possible to keep the original date and time? Thanks!

		I just noticed that the beta version uses a new permission. I tracked the origin of the change down to the master branch: 905b68b#diff-a48d6def78e18cbabab3c95ae3c9fc49R44 I created a comment there but I wanted to create an official issue as well, since I deem this important. READ_PHONE_STATE allows to access a lot of information about the phone, including the IMEI of the phone and details about the SIM card. Is this really necessary? Was it added by accident? I do not find any usage of TelephonyManager which would require the permission.

		The details screen serves no real purpose anymore. It only duplicates the info which is available elsewhere: name size date file type (it even wrongly states SVG files are of type JPEG) ability to favorite So I would say we should get rid of that screen and remove the action in the long-press file menu. This also serves as reducing the actions in the file menu, see #1144 cc @tobiasKaminsky @AndyScherzinger @davivel @masensio @MTRichards

		@elpraga Would it be possible to use enlarged small definition thumbnails instead of the circle until the big thumbnail is available? In the same way google does it when looking at searched images in Chrome on Android? It could be a nice usability improvement. Related to #1044

		Before OC8.2, I had several external storages (SFTP) mounted on a per-OC-user base, so every user had to enter login and password to use the external storage. As I use LDAP, all user's logins are the same, so this was quite a bit of double work. Now I switched to OC 8.2's new method to use session credentials. I globally added the external storage with this option, so OC logs in every user with his or her OC credentials to the SSH server. This works fine in the web interface and with normal WebDAV-access. The android app, however, does not even display the external storage mounted with &quot;use session credentials&quot;.

		Since Android 5.0, Android has a new camera api with the ability to save the photos as *.dng. This is a raw format and very interesting for photographers. Apps like &quot;Camera FV-5&quot; support this feature. Expected behaviour All Images/Photos will be uploaded into my owncloud, when a made a new one. Actual behaviour The instantUpload is uploading the *.jpg and not the *.dng file. The files are in the same folder and the files are written in the same moment. Environment data Android Version : 6.0 Device model : Google Nexus 5 Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.8.0 ownCloud server version: 8.2.0

		What happens: I select &quot;on device&quot; from the sliding menu on the left. Both list and grid views show only files on device. Nevertheless when I list through the pinctures in fullscreen, I still list through all picutres in the directory. What I expect to happen: When I select &quot;on device&quot; I expect to see only the photos on device when I list through in fullscreen. Hope I managed to explain myself 😄 I am not sure if current behaviour is intentional or not.

		Due to playing with the changing storage path feature I managed to move the folder to a parent folder where &quot;owncloud-beta&quot; already exists. At this point it stops. Maybe a question if the app should proceed and write into it (and maybe overwrite something) is a useful idea?

But if the wifi connection where lost and some pictures have to be uploaded, the app uses the mobile connection to upload. Looks like, that the app doesn't check the wifi connection on every picture or video on start upload.

		Hi, I wanted to use &quot;share with users&quot;, but all I got was: Sorry, your server version does not allow share with users within clients. Please contact your administrator Although I am the admin I was clueless ;) After digging in the code the problem is that my server is 8.1.x and not 8.2.x. So I suggest to change the error message to: Sorry, your server version is 8.1.2 and sharing with users within clients is supported by at least 8.2.0. Please upgrade the server (or similar).

On the other hand, when you tap on it, you may change the options @tobiasKaminsky not sure about the difference between: move file to OC folder and delete origin file do nothing - probably, we should define a default mode which I'd say: copy file to OC folder ❓

Github user @afollestad created a library that wraps around the Google Api and provides fingerprint unlock with a passphrase fallback. Would it be possible to implement this as another method to unlock the app (instead of a PIN code)? Library: https://github.com/afollestad/digitus

		When I upload a file from my phone to my server, the app creates a folder on my phone and copies the file to that folder... so now I have 2 copies of ever file I upload on my phone. This effectively cuts my phone storage in half, and is crazy if I want to upload hundreds or thousands of photos. What is the thinking behind this? Dropbox does not do this. If this &quot;feature&quot; is going to remain then it should be able to be turned off in the settings. Yes, I could upload a file then go and delete the copy that was made on my phone, but I don't want to do this.

		Hi @przybylski, on a fresh install I have switched the storage path to external sdcard and used it a lot. After a reinstall (due to some tests) I wanted to switch a fresh-install back to the external sdcard. This does not work as owncloud says that the folder is existing (we talked about it). Now the question is, how to deal with such a situation? Deleting the folder and download all files once again is not a good option. The official app does not care if the folder exists and tries to use it, or? Maybe, if the folder exists the app should ask: &quot;use it&quot; or &quot;rename and move internal folder to external&quot;. What do you think?

		Hi, The android client for owncloud is throwing the following error when trying to connect over HTTPS: &quot;Unknown error ocurred!&quot; after testing the connection. I just updated recently to core version 8.2.1 and suddenly the mobile connectivity stopped working. I am using nginx + php5-fpm (5.6.16-2+deb.sury.org~trusty+1 (fpm-fcgi)) in ubuntu 14.04 and the nginx config is directly the config you provide in the official documentation. I put here a capture of nginx logs when the mobile app tries to connect: [08/Dec/2015:19:12:54 +0000] &quot;GET /status.php HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 106 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Android) ownCloud-android/1.9.0&quot; &quot;-&quot; It seems like the webserver responds properly but the mobile app fails to connect. I am trying to connecto from a Nexus 5 with Android 6.0, but this is also reproducible in other mobile phones and in Android 5.x This is getting very annoying and I would be very please if you could take a look. Thanks in advance.

		Since 1.9.0 the Android OC client is constantly syncing and keeping the device awake when the auto-sync option under &quot;Accounts&quot; is checked. I've got it installed on two 5.1.1 devices and this behaviour occurs on both. Once it has finished scanning the whole folder structure it starts again after 30-60 seconds, keeping the device awake (it never goes do deep-sleep), draining the battery and generating permanent traffic. This didn't occur with 1.8.0. Because of that I had to disable auto sync. Does anyone have this problem as well?

		Hi, I just tried to install the 20151202 beta on a Nexus 5 Android 6.0.1 via f-droid. The phone was cleanly installed today. It fails at the end of the installation process with the not so helpful message &quot;Failed to install due to an unknown error&quot; Other apps installed just fine via F-droid. Please let me know if there's a way to get a more helpful message from this.

			<description>
		One sorely lacking feature (unless it's already implemented in which case this is a bug report) is the lack of ownCloud's app acting as a document provider. A document provider essentially tells the Android operating system that it is an application that manages files. Google Drive is a document provider, and therefore whenever the OS-level file picker comes up (for example, when selecting a new image as a wallpaper), Google Drive is offered as one such service you can use to browse files. Implementing this feature shouldn't be too terrible hard, all the documentation on it is provided here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html

		One personal annoyance is that the ownCloud app downloads every image that I open on my devices to the internal storage. Sometimes, I want to view an image just temporarily and NOT have it automatically downloaded and stored to /sdcard/owncloud/.../. Perhaps downloading them into a cache would be more proper, then if the user clicks the menu button, offer to let them download the image and then it would be appropriate to save it to /sdcard/owncloud/.../. Otherwise every image I view from a different folder (and I have many, many folders) from the ownCloud app triggers Google Play Services to shoot me a notification asking if I want to backup that folder to Google Photos.

Nothing was changed on the server (otp in use for a long time with no problem) and this log started appearing right after update to the material design, so i think something changed on the client; ii owncloud 8.1.4-12.1 ii php5 5.6.14+dfsg-0+deb8u1 ii apache2 2.4.10-10+deb8u3

		Expected behaviour it should be possible to not autosynch/refresh specific folders. Actual behaviour the client is relentless and goes on for hours, synching scanning a folder that was removed locally, until the phone runs out of battery. i have a directory in my owncloud storage that i do not want to synch on my phone as it's rather big (~2GB). what i've done so far is select the directory in the client, select 'remove' and then 'local copy only'. i'm not sure if this is supposed to disable the synching of this directory from that point on, but as i see no other setting where i can exempt this folder, i guess it should. Steps to reproduce have a rather big folder in your owncloud (~2gb in my case) wait. Environment data Android version: 5.1 Device model: Moto G LTE 1st gen Stock or customized system: stock ownCloud app version: 1.9.0 ownCloud server version: 8.1.2 Logs Web server error log this goes on for hours: PROPFIND /remote.php/webdav/that_folder/[...]
 ownCloud log (data/owncloud.log) there are no entries from the time the issue occured.

		What I'm doing : -Check automatic picture upload -Check only wifi What is happening : -Nothing most of the time -If I'm on wifi + owncloud in the background + I take a picture : It uploads it What I'm expecting to happen : -Should upload all the pictures that has been taken when I didn't had wifi -The app shouldn't have to be launched to upload pictures Some suggestion : -Maybe a way to disable the owncloud notification / icon on each upload. -Are the weird kind of &quot;loading&quot; dots on the top of the app made on purpose ? They look weird. -Users should be able to chose the folder name for auto upload, if you have more than one device it is a mess. Thanks for reading :)

Currently the ownCloud-Client closes when the back button is pressed in the root folder view. Other apps, e.g. the ownCloud Newsreader, first open the navigation drawer and when pressing back a second time with the open drawer it leaves the app.

		I've just deployed a letsencrypt HTTPS certificate on my owncloud server. Firefox and Chrome are fine with the cert and can successfully validate it, however, the Owncloud Android app still issues a warning that the cert is signed by an unknown authority. A quick Google search tells me that this may be related to which Android URL API is in use, however, I can't give more details ATM. Issue occurs on Owncloud app 1.9.0.

		Using fdroid's owncloud beta151222 on a Nexus 6p with PureNexus rom, I perform the following steps, Long press on a folder I would like to share with another user. Press the share button in the top bar. Click 'Add User Or Group'. Type in user's name. No list pops up and pressing the enter button does nothing. I noticed it still works well in the stable version. This essentially disables sharing with other users. Thanks for any help you can provide. I'm really enjoying beta.

		The beta app is already a very powerful and handy image viewer, and as it provides the option to view previews without having to download the original and to control the cache size, it became my viewer of choice for many occasions. Would it be too hard to add the possibility to rotate the photo? I know it could be tricky as sometimes we only have the preview, and it would only make sense, if the rotation got uploaded automatically to server, but.. What do You think?

		Some previews appear with the original photo in the top left corner and the rest of the space filled by white. I checked the original preview on the server and it appears OK. Maybe some glitch in the way the previews are displayed? Let me know if I should provide more info.

		Considering the beta app, currently we create thumbnails that look great for both the list and the grid, but when we tap and open an image, what we see is the same thumbnail that is shown inside the grid. I think the best way to handle this situation is to show a thumbnail that looks like the original one but it's smaller (we could compress PNGs to JPGs and resize them to the screen size, so that the image size is kept low and in the same time we can't really feel a compression+size). The original image will be downloaded when requested explicitly. P.S. I also think that showing a compress image (in terms of format and quality only) inside the web client would be great as well. For example I keep a huge amount of images in my owncloud, and would be great surfing on them without have to wait even more than 10s to have some of them loaded. – EDIT: it actually works in this way :) Another option would be loading images progressively.

		following up on the discussion in #1346 I was thinking it makes sense to hide the FAB when the multi select is active and show it again when multi select has been done. Pro: it removed the then unnecessary FAB since it has no actions for a multi select and could be considered clutter at this very moment Con: show/hide might be confusing since it doesn't add extra functionality and might feel jumpy Since I am not a UI/UX expert looping in @jancborchardt and also @tobiasKaminsky since it relates to the multi select discussion. What do you think? Personally I would hide it during multi select simply to &quot;see&quot; a list and nothing else :)

		Hi, I noticed, that images uploaded to OC, are copied to owncloud/OC-installation/SofortUpload and that they are remaining there - until forever, thus still blocking urgently needed storage space on the SD-CARD . Selecting an Option like: Delete image (video) after successful upload will make better use of the limited resources on a handset. Since the image is stored in the DCIM folder as well, there is still ONE local copy available and not TWO copies, whereas the copy in the OC folder is only required for upload purposes. regards, hitam4450

		I think that the current concept of Favorites is somewhat misleading. I might have a &quot;Favorite&quot; folder that lies deep within the folder tree which I want to access quickly, but it does not necessarily mean that I want this whole folder synced on my phone. Would it be possible to make &quot;Bookmarks&quot; in the left menu part (where the access to configuration, and on device / all files switch is now) that would be merely a list of shortcuts to get us quickly deep into menu structure?

		This is related to #899 Scenario: select a single list item and click on details menu item: In case you hit the back button (or click on the arrow in the action bar), the selection mode gets disabled and you are still in the details screen. Imho this is only a not very nice detail and should be resolved automatically when #1275 gets approved and merged (since it removed the details menu item). So looping in @jancborchardt and @tobiasKaminsky

		Currently the share popup has these dark blue header boxes. This is a tad jarring and should instead be done by whitespace and proper header text (darkblue text color). Just like in the settings. (Also, the Share text at the very top of the box should be correctly left aligned with the rest of the text.)

		My OC server uses a CAcert.org certificate (which had to be manually &quot;trusted&quot; after checking the fingerprint when the oc client was setup initially). I recently updated the certificate, because it was close to expire. When upstarting the OC Android client, or when clicking &quot;Konto aktualisieren&quot; (account sync), no warning information was shown (that the certificate has changed). But when actually performing a file action like &quot;delete file on the server&quot; (I only tried &quot;delete&quot; actions), the client shows the certificate-untrusted warning, so that I then could manually check the new fingerprint and set permanent trust to the renewed connection's certificate. I regard the following as a bug: certificate is not tested during syncing (certificate-has-changed information is not shown during syncing; it is however tested when actually performing a file action like delete.

		The multiselect header has a strange horizontal blue line in there. Also, when multiselecting one file and then going to »Details«, the header is still in multiselect mode. Should be normal though, since in that view there is no multiselection.

		Currently the secondary button is grey with the dark ownCloud blue as text. However that's a bit much use of the brand color. Better would be to have the text color here black. Or if that's too intense compared to the primary button, a dark shade of grey.

		Expected behaviour When I hit the &quot;Synchronize&quot; menu item, files stored locally on my device should be uploaded to the server. Ideally, this should happen automatically. Actual behaviour Files are downloaded from the server, but local changes are not uploaded. Steps to reproduce Open Android app. Long press on a folder. Select &quot;Synchronize&quot; The folder is stored in the local filesystem /storage/emulated/0/owncloud/user@server/foldername/ Edit one of the downloaded files - or save a new file in the folder. Changes and new files are not automatically syncronised. Repeat step 3. Changes and new files are not automatically syncronised. I've gone into Android's system settings - accounts - owncloud - and enabled &quot;Sync Files&quot;. The problem still persists. I suppose I want the same functionality as the Linux Desktop client - the ability to selectively sync folders. Is that possible? If not, can this menu item be renamed &quot;Download&quot; rather than &quot;Synchronize&quot;? Environment data Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Nexus 6 Stock or customized system: CM13 ownCloud app version: 1.9 ownCloud server version: 8.2 Logs Web server error log N/A ownCloud log (data/owncloud.log) N/A

		Not sure what exactly it’s caused by, but today has been the third instance of the ownCloud app eating my battery in a massive way. Even though I wasn’t really using it today so far. System is a Moto G with Cyanogenmod 12.1, Android 5.1. I use 2 accounts, no instant upload, some favorites though. Can anyone reproduce @tobiasKaminsky @AndyScherzinger @llucax @davivel @masensio

		Hi ! When using the Android OwnCloud client, I have to manually select a file and click on &quot;synchronize&quot; otherwise, its content is not updated -- although the file properties are correctly updated in the Owncloud client. STEPS TO PERFORM perform the initial synchronization for instance I have a file called todo.txt in Documents/ which is properly synced I make a modification on my desktop client (KDE under Kubuntu). I make sure this is properly uploaded to the server : this is OK (checked from web interface) the file is not synced on the Android device I check the Owncloud client on the Android device : I can see the new filesize and new file date is displayed but when I click on the file, I can still see its former content the only way to make the OC Android client sync it properly is to select &quot;synchronize&quot; in the file context menu The problem is it has to be done manually each time. This is misleading as files attributes, in the OC client, are the right ones but the file content is not updated. Using : Server : Owncloud 8.1 (web4all.fr hosting) Desktop client : Kubuntu 14.04 LTS + Owncloud client v.2.1 Android Phone : Samsung Galaxy Core Prime LTE ; Android 5.0.2 Android Owncloud client : 1.9.0 Thanks to everyone involved ! Cheers !

		Hello, I'm newbie in OC, but I'm stuck and cannot find any solution. I'm running OC8.2 on headless Debian Server (Trusty) with MySQL. I am running OwnClient Android appli on Android 5.0.2/Samsung S5: I have Instant video upload and Inst enabled on Android App, with upload via Wifi only Here is description of the issue and outcome of my investigations: If I'm connected on my Wifi home network with my mobile and I record a video, the video is immediately uploaded to OC. This is perfect. If I'm not connectd on wifi network and I record a video, this video will never be uploaded to my OC when I'm back at home, connected on my Wifi. Additinal information :idea: : I have also changed the OC folder for video upload several time (I have initially suspected that using same folder for images and videos could cause troubles), but it does not change anything. when a video is uploaded successfully (when I'm at home, recording and connected), I get the following error in the logs: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /var/www/owncloud/3rdparty/sabre/http/lib/Sapi.php:70) at /var/www/owncloud/3rdparty/sabre/http/lib/Sapi.php#58 Your help will be appreciated.

		When the server uses a different/new certificate, the client just does not update any files anymore. There is no warning or anything. GoTo Settings -&gt; Add account -&gt; Type in server address -&gt; Client is going to check the connection and asks if you trust the certificate. Accept and everything works again. Probably only an issue with self signed certificates.

 As far as I understand, this says it is failing to retrieve https://owncloud.iandouglasscott.com/status.php, but that loads properly in the browser on my phone, so I don't know why this isn't working. It is probably a server-side issue, since using https://demo.owncloud.org as the url works. Edit: The Linux desktop client seems to be working fine.

		Expected behaviour Server changed SSL key after expiry (self signed certificate). Clients should ask for accepting self signed certificate and then work fine Actual behaviour Browsers and desktop clients correctly recognize new certificate, ask for overriding self signed and work fine after accepting. Mobile clients (Android and iOS) continue browsing repository, but fail to download and upload files (without any error message in client or server - not sure about this but didn't find anything). Steps to reproduce Use Server with self signed SSL certificate Create profile on mobile clients Let server certificate expire Change server certificate to new self signed certificate Browse files with mobile client and try to download or upload files Workaround delete profile on mobile client recreate profile on mobile client (offline data keeps present, but certificate is validated) Environment data Android 4.1.2 and iOS 9.2.1 ownCloud app version: current (1.9.1) on Android, current (17.02.2016) on iOS ownCloud server version: 8.2.2 Logs Web server error log [Wed Feb 17 23:20:27.719478 2016] [authz_core:error] [pid 18301] [client x.x.x.x:47288] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /var/www/owncloud/data/htaccesstest.txt (only message since last apache restart) ownCloud log (data/owncloud.log)

		Expected behaviour If I set my password to test² I'm able to login to ownCloud via web or the native clients for debian and Windows 7. This should be the case for the android app also. Actual behaviour The app shows &quot;wrong username or password&quot; if I try to connect. If I set the connection to unencrypted and sniff the traffic, I can see that the app changes some special characters to question marks. Screenshots can be found here (german): https://florianmai.de/2016/03/13/owncloud-fuer-android-hat-probleme-mit-sonderzeichen/ Steps to reproduce Setup an account Change password to something containing characters like ² or ł Login via android app Environment data Android version: 5.1.1 Device model: Oneplus One Stock or customized system: Stock OxygenOS 2.1.4 ownCloud app version: latest on the play store ownCloud server version: 8.2.2 Logs Web server error log Webserver is working fine

		Expected behaviour The app is performing a long-running wifi-only upload (in my specific case, triggered by instant upload triggered by me being briefly near my home). I then leave wifi range within a few seconds of entering it. The app should suspend the ongoing upload (because I told it on its settings page that I only want it to upload on wifi). Actual behaviour The app proceeded to drain my data allowance by continuing to upload on an (unfortunately very fast LTE-based) cell network. Steps to reproduce Start wifi-only upload Leave wifi range Watch it drain your data allowance Environment data Android version: 6.0.1r22 Device model: One plus One Stock or customized system: Cyanogenmod nightly from Mar 21 ownCloud app version: 1.9.1 from FDroid ownCloud server version: 8.2

		STEPS TO REPRODUCE 1.- Upload a large file (it is added to &quot;Current view&quot;) 2.- Upload again the same file before the first upload finishes ACTUAL BEHAVIOUR Both uploads do not appear in the uploads view. Only one of them is uploaded. EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR Both uploads appears in the &quot;Current&quot; list. When both are finished, both files are stored in ownCloud, one of them renamed by adding &quot;(2)&quot; to the filename. Both files appear as &quot;Uploaded&quot; in uploads view. Tested with Nexus9 v6 and Galaxy S3 v4 Server v9 App version 1.9.1

		Like the title says use the toolbar - Google's new, to be used implementation of the top bar instead of the action bar which can be considered legacy. Motivation The actionbar is simply a bar which can have a menu, search widget and in newer AppCompat versions also a drawer implementation but isn't as flexible as the toolbar. Reasons and benefits The toolbar can be customized on many ways like but not limited to: adding any kind of views to it, like the progressbar which would be nice especially when we integrate the multi select branch (no dark blue line below the then grey bar) no dark blue line below the bar when the drawer is opened animate it, like scrolling it away on a list/recycler view which seems nice on the file browsing views the material drawer can be full height, like mentioned in #1210 because this is only possible for the toolbar not the action bar (it can be done with hacks though) I would like to work on this in case we agree this is worth implementing which I strongly suggest to make the bar future proof and also to be able to implement the above mentioned gimmicks. So pinging @davivel @jancborchardt @malkomich @tobiasKaminsky and @przybylski for feedback on this matter.

		There is this option to either leave a picture at the original place or move it to the app folder. When set to move files to the app folder, the current v1.9.1 from F-Droid does not really move them but leave behind 0-byte files: This also happened to this very screenshot, that I had to upload manually, as it does not land in the default pictures directory /sdcard0/DCIM/Camera but in /sdcard0/Pictures/Screenshots.

		Expected behaviour Connect to ADFS 3.0 Actual behaviour with ADFS 3.0 the user cannot connect at all, and more institutions move towards ADFS 3.0 so this issue is much higher priority Steps to reproduce With an ADFS 3.0 institution of us states the android client isn't capable of &quot;SNI (Server Name Indication)&quot; - a feature of SSL TLS and both Web Application Proxy and AD FS 2012 R2 use it to enable simpler deployment and remove networking prerequisites. While the customer are trying to find a workaround, maybe engineering can have a look at your end if it is possible to cope with SNI.

		Hi, after a chrash I wiped my tablet. After that I installed ownloud app and tried to connect with my owncloud server. After I entered the server address I get an error: could not establish a connection. (in German: Konnte keine Verbindung aufbauen) The connect button is grey,I can't connect to the server. Before the crash everything works fine. If I enter the url in a browser I get the login on my server and everything is fine. Sync client on my pc althoug works without problems. I use a Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 with Cyanogen Mod 11, and current owncloud app (Ver 1.9.1). Owncloud-Server ist 8.2.2 on BananaPi with Debian Wheezy an nginx. SSL enabled, SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt. I connect to the server with an DynDns Domain name like https://myDynDns.com:40000

		When uploading an image the app should automatically generate a thumbnail. This enhances the UX as the app has only to generate thumbnails for files on the server when entering a folder.

		Let's say I upload some images from my Android phone's photo gallery into a folder called &quot;Uploads&quot; on my ownCloud server. When I use the ownCloud app to view the Uploads folder, if I tap an image that I want to see, it gets automatically downloaded to my phone and put in a new folder named Uploads. Great... If I view 100 photos now I have 100 duplicate images on my phone wasting space. Seems to me the act of downloading and saving, as opposed to simply viewing the image on the server, should be an optional selection. For example long press on the image and choose Download from a popup menu.

		At the moment I'm using owncloud android app 1.9.1 (via Stackstorage) but I'm missing out on a feature. All folders I created and files I uploaded in the web/windows client are only visible when I manually refresh the directory (pull-down refresh) in app. For example, I create a directory structure like this in-browser: Root = Folder 1 == Folder 2 === Folder 3 When I open my storage in the android app, I land up in root and there is no folder visible and the message &quot;Nothing in here. Upload something!&quot; is showing. I have to manually refresh the directory and then Folder 1 becomes visible. When I open Folder 1, it is empty again and I have to manually refresh to see Folder 2. The same for Folder 3. A nice feature would be that the file/dir listing is automatically refreshed so I don't need to manually refresh the x.xxx folders I have in my storage. Not sure if it's a bug or a feature request, but I hope you guys can help out!

		Right now, the three buttons in FAB are (in order): [a] Upload (files) [b] New Folder [c] Content from other apps (Upload) [a] and [c] should appear together, since both are &quot;upload&quot; buttons. Let's say both together on the top, then [b] right over the FAB. @jancborchardt , @AndyScherzinger , is it OK for you?

		Expected behaviour Files that were synchronized should stay on my smartphone until i delete them (local or remote) Actual behaviour All files get deleted by Samsungs Smart Manager App every day (or even faster??). The app somehow recognizes the synchronized files as temporary files and cleans up storage as soon as a (unknown) limit is reached. The app can't be uninstalled/deactivated as it is a preinstalled system app by Samsung. Steps to reproduce Synchronize a file/folder in the client Start Smart Manager app and cleanup storage All synced files are gone Environment data Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Samsung Galaxy S6 Stock or customized system: stock ownCloud app version: 1.9.1 ownCloud server version: 9.0

		Expected behaviour It would be great to have the ability to search from within the app. This could be either folderwise (in the long press menu) or at the top right corner of the app - that's were I expected it to be. Possible Implementation Search function could just call the serverside search function and display its results.

		It happens pretty often that my instant upload fails. I'm not quite sure why that is the case, it then just displays &quot;Upload failed&quot;. Is there a way to find out why it fails? Regarding that an upload can fail for any reason (e.g. networking), it would be nice if the owncloud client retried uploading by itself or from time to time synchronises the instant upload directory with not yet uploaded files from the phone (those that failed, &quot;really new ones&quot; are being tried to upload) either automatically or manually (synchronize folder or so). The current state on my Owncloud Client 1.9.1 on Cyanogenmod 12.1 is that the images that failed on uploading just never appear on the server and that I don't even seem to have a manual way to do it (except finding out by myself which images weren't uploaded and then select and upload them manually).

		To switch the storage folder to external sd card you have to create the owncloud-beta folder BEFORE switching. It would be more convinient when the folder is created automatically or at least there would be a message to create the folder by your own.

		Expected behaviour ownCloud should not crash on any build for non-assertion failures Actual behaviour ownCloud crashes when Log.wtf is called on userdebug devices. Steps to reproduce Run ownCloud on userdebug build on Android Log into demo.owncloud.org This crashes either immediately or after you have signed in seemingly depending on the speed of your phone (if it can display the file list fragment before it switches to login activity) Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) Yes. Environment data Android version: Android MHC19Q Device model: Nexus 6P Stock or customized system: Stock compiled as userdebug using instructions at https://source.android.com/source/building.html ownCloud app version: ownCloud server version: Logs Web server error log Insert your webserver log here

Actual behaviour When &quot;Upload only on WiFi&quot; is set, an message indicating a failed upload appears after taking a picture with a camera.

		Setting up the instant uploads to &quot;only wifi&quot;: each pic you take with phone bandwidth, a notification &quot;Failed Upload&quot; is returned. If it is setting up &quot;only wifi&quot; and you does not have wifi connection, the fact that the pic is not uploaded is the expected behaviour and not a failure, and perhaps the user/device should not be notified. It would be different if the device has any kind of connectivity.

		Expected behaviour The App should give me the possibility to sort files descending. Option &quot;Z-A&quot; should be implemented. Why? Because I InstantUpload my photos. Sometimes upload of single files failed probably due to unstable mobile data connection or so. This leads to (probably) correct sorting by 'server create date'/'upload time' at &quot;Newest-Oldest&quot; option But causes to irritating list view. (e.g. Dsc_2011, Dsc_2012, Dsc_2009, Dsc_2013,...) The &quot;A-Z&quot; option is not practically usable due to endlos list scrolling till I would reach newest uploads . ### Actual behaviour Only Option &quot;A-Z&quot; and &quot;Newest-Oldest&quot; are selectable.

			<description>
		Problem: Android N is coming out in October, and we need to prepare the ownCloud app to work with the expected changes. In fact, we are expecting a few changes, many largely due to the concern of Android to conserve batteries. The big issues we know of are: The current instant uploads approach will no longer work. The alternative is the media store, so we need to switch to use it. BUT, it is not clear how immediate the notifications are so it might not be immediate instant uploads. The synchronization of the accounts will also not work because of the loss of the background The DOZE subsystem from Android 6 continues with ownCloud (designed to save battery life), but gets worse in N from our perspective. When the phone is left alone, and even moving but the screen is dark, after a some period of time makes other systems not available, such as the network. This means uploads in progress will be killed. A user can then reactivate them manually in ownCloud, but we need to deal with the fact that at any moment the system can interrupt the network, and thus kill sync and uploads/downloads. Users can disable Doze as well, but this is not ideal. However, a user can be asked this with a redirect to the system dialog about turning off Doze. One alternative for instant uploads is to create a service that is watching the folder for changes, and then we know immediately when a photo appears (solves 1). But then the second problem with Doze happens, and we need to figure out how to deal with it. Perhaps we can use the new chunking and add pause/resume capability, and chunk handling, so that when Doze interrupts the network, the app is able to resume rather than restart the upload. Ideal dev end state: Create a service that watches the file/folder for cnahges Update the uploader to be able to work in the short active windows between when Doze is on Add the ability for the pause and resume of uploads using the new 9.1 chunking, as well as older ownCloud instances. This likely means chunking and pause/resume will only be enabled on servers 9.1 or newer, and for older servers pause resume is not possible. (maybe) We need to consider how we resume downloads or we have the same problem as well for a synced folder / favorites Effort: This is a major effort when combined. Individually, this is also large individually. Conceivably this could be just a little later than the release of Android N. @davivel And @davivel was here: Problems to fix: Pictures / videos taken with the mobile need to be added automatically to OC if the user enable 'instant uploads : #6 ; related also: #744 Adapt to Doze; this will require some direct experimentation, &quot;Doze mode&quot; may be enforced with development tools: #1684

		As an ownCloud user, I want to sync files to my mobile devices automatically so that I can have always the latest files available on my mobile platform Acceptance Criteria: Current “not granted offline” continues as currently implemented in iOS (tap on a file downloads, tap again downloads latest, changes are uploaded to server if found) Current “not granted offline” in Android needs to be updated to meet user expectations: tap on a file downloads tap again downloads latest #333 local changes are uploaded to server if found, without user interaction #1683 Current favorite functionality is renamed available offline The available offline overlay icon is a download arrow with a bar underneath Mobile sync error status is changed to red circle x from desktop Successfully synced files are shown with a green check mark from desktop Syncing files are shown with a circular blue arrow from desktop File transfers in process are the same circular blue arrows from desktop Android Badges and changing current favorites to sync folder #1218 Automated Sync Folder #1136 iOS Badges and changing current favorites to sync folder owncloud/ios#463 🎉 2

			<description>
		When I'm taking pictures, I usually take a couple and choose the best out of them afterwards. But by the time I've chosen my favorite and deleted the other copies, owncloud already uploaded all pictures. So now I have to delete 6 pictures in the client (which is tedious, because there doesn't seem to be multi select.) I would love to have a setting where I can set a delay (5mins, 15mins or 30mins for example) to upload the pictures. If the photo is still there by then, upload it, if it isn't, delete the queue entry. For everybody finding this on Google until it might be implemented: I solved this by using FolderSync (or any other sync app) I use anyways and upload the pictures every 30mins. Sometimes I take them right before an upload cycle, but most of the time it works just fine.

		Expected behaviour Tell us what should happen Instant upload after taken picture Actual behaviour Tell us what happens instead Instant upload failes Steps to reproduce Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server?

However the server address in the failed picture uploads reads like : user@ipocserver/owncloud/ownCloud/SofortVideo Error message: Zugangsdaten falsch! I repeated the setup the account several times, double and triple checked all input info, however the error remains still the the same! I do know where /ownCloud comes from! However, the SofortUpload directory is shared with my OC 9.02 Backup server at a different Ip address! After removing the share, the Error message remains the same! regards, hitam4450

		Steps to reproduce Install ownCloud 2.0.0 on a Andoid device that runs German as language Open the ownCloud application and goto &quot;Uploads&quot; view Tab the &quot;Option&quot; Button in the right top Try to understand what I can do in this menu: Can some explain what the options in the Upload menu are good for? The German translation doesn't make sense at all in my eyes: I have no idea what the app should when I choose on of the four options I have no idea what the app actually does when I choose on of the four options The german translation doesn't make sense at all Manual doesn't help: https://doc.owncloud.org/android/android_app.html#managing-files If someone can provide me with the English translation I'll be happy to translate into German. I saw more German participants here, so all are invited to discuss.

		The multi-window is a new interface design in Android devices available from Android N API (#1675), to keep in the screen more than one application. There are two different modes in mult-window interface: multiple app mode, and picture-in-picture. I suggest to implement the compatibility as a first approach to adapt our interface, because I think the picture-in-picture may not gives much functionality to the ownCloud app. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/multi-window.html

		Thumbnails of images are currently shown in 3 different places. The uploadlist, the local file browser and the normal folder view of an nextcloud folder. The code to generate a thumbnail / kickof the thumbnail generation is present in all of there places. To unify this, i would like to propose a ThumbImageView class which subclases ImageView. This Class should handle all concern regarding File or OCFile -&gt; Thumbnail, by calling ThumbManager and so on. The ImageView objects are reused in the list views, all code accesing these Views has to check whether the reference they use, still refer to a View with the initial File, this could be solved by having a Reference to OCFile or File on the ThumbImageView aswell as the unique thumbnail CacheKey! So we have some new methods like void setFile(File file); void setOCFile(OCFile file); int getCacheKey(); (maybe override .hashCode(), but this could be problematic with OCFiles not existing) Another possibility would be to introduce two additional classes FileThumbImageView and OCFileThumbImageView.. As far as i understand it, the Upload Queue and local filebrowser lists use File and the nextcloud folder browser uses OCFile.. This should only a refactor not any addition of new functionality.

docker run -d --name owncloud-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somePassWord -e MYSQL_DATABASE=owncloud -e MYSQL_USER=owncloud -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=someOtherPassWord --volumes-from owncloud-mysql-volume owncloud-mysql-volume
docker run -d --name owncloud -e BASEPATH=/owncloud -e WEBROOT=/owncloud -e URL=some.url -e UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE=16G -e MAX_INPUT_TIME=7200 --volumes-from owncloud-volume --link owncloud-mysql:mysql
 In front of OwnCloud, there is a Nginx reverse proxy, that does SSL (with a valid certificate), and redirects http to https, using docker image mwaeckerlin/reverse-proxy, the relevant part here is: docker run -d --name reverse-proxy -p 443:443 -p 80:80 --link owncloud:some.url%2fowncloud [...] mwaeckerlin/reverse-proxy
 I configures instant upload, also from mobile. What Happens Some files succeed, some files fail. I don't see any major difference between those files. Sometimes files do upload after some numbers of retrials, some did not (yet), even so I retried many many times. Upload bar goes to 100%, then fails. Uploads may fail regardless whether they are triggered by the instant upload or manually by using «share» with the OwnCloud app. Expected behaviour All files always succeed. Steps to reproduce Try to share some files, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) Since it is an occasional behaviour, I can't really test that. Environment data Android version: 5.1, 6.0.1,.5.1.1 Device model: Sony XPeria Z3 Compact, Xperia M5, Xperia Z2 tablet Stock or customized system: - ownCloud app version: 2.0.1 ownCloud server version: 9.0.3 Logs Web server error log Funny, upload just succeeded, when I wanted to get the logs for the failure. This after about 10-20 fails for the same file. So here you see all the logs for the file where I replaced the original file name by filename and the external IP by 66.66.66.66. The first attempts were fails, the last attempt was successful: On Nginx: 66.66.66.66 - mwaeckerlin [08/Jul/2016:08:44:01 +0000] &quot;HEAD /owncloud/remote.php/webdav/clientsync/navigation/filename..gpx HTTP/1.1&quot; 301 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Android) ownCloud-android/1.9.0&quot;

 ownCloud log (data/owncloud.log) Nothing special, at least the file name does not appear. Unfortunately, there is a lot of traffic, several desktop clients and Android DAV clients do their synchronisation tasks at the same time. So I need to filter the relevant parts and cannot just paste everything here.

		I installed Owncloud and am loving it except for the mobile app (android). I'm use to the Dropbox app. The Owncloud app downloads the file before I can view it where Dropbox allows me to view automatically. Can Owncloud do this and how? If not, can someone tell me how to change the default download directory for the mobile app as I don't want my phones memory filling up when I have an external memory card I could be using. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4 running 4.4.4 stock ownCloud app version: 2.0.1 ownCloud server version: 8.0 Thank you

		Files get synced if I open the file I changed foo.txt on my desktop PC. The next day I want to see this change on my mobile device. But the change was not on the device yet. I needed internet connection during opening foo.txt Expected behaviour I want my device to sync (up and download) the whole account automatically. Background: I want to have my updated files in a wireless area (for example in a train). It is too late if the android app tries to sync the file when I open it. This needs to be done at home, before I leave. I want this for all files of a given account. Steps to reproduce Edit file on PC Wait some hours (For me syncing once an hour would be a good default) Switch of internet connection at android device New content is not available :-( Environment data Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galay S2 Stock or customized system: stock ownCloud app version: 2.0.1 ownCloud server version: Where can I see this?

		Actual behaviour The owncloud Android app is enabled to upload pictures automatically. However, this does not work on my Galaxy A3 / Android 5.1.1 Manual upload through the app works, hence it can't be a matter of permission but must be something else. Please let me know what information I can provide to further narrow down the issue and help solve it. Many thanks in advance!

		Actual behaviour When the app automatically upload a picture after it's been taken, the exif of the image file indicate the date of the upload, not the original date and time of the picture. If the upload succeed imediately after the photo shoot, there is not big problem. But when the upload fails, the exif of the image indicate the datetime of the retried upload, not the original exif. Expected behaviour The exif of an uploaded image should always be the original one. Else, it mess up the order and the chronology and it's a problem. Environment data Android version: up to date. Device model: One Plus One Stock or customized system: Cyanogen ownCloud app version: up to date. ownCloud server version: 9.0.1

		A video is recorded or photo is taken and instant upload kicks in. The phone is put into sleep mode and next time it is woken up OwnCloud displays an error message. Upload failed 'app was terminated'. Presumably Android is terminating the service when the phone goes into sleep mode. I understand that the desktop client breaks files down into chunks for uploading. Could the Android client not implement the same behaviour? Then the service could be created as START_STICKY and resume uploading from the previous chunk when it gets restarted. This would also help when switching between wifi hotspots or moving from wifi to cellular data. The issue is occurring on a Samsung Galaxy J7 with Android Marshmallow

		Actual behaviour I have enabled automatic image upload on my Android owncloud app. Suddenly I got Unknown error and the image could not be uploaded. When I looked at the server error log, I read the actual error message: 507 Insufficient Storage. Expected behaviour Why is not the server error used, which explains exactly what is going on. Unknown error is not very descriptive. Steps to reproduce Enable automatic image upload on your Android app Set a too low quota on the server Take a picture with your phone and wait for the automatic image upload I don't know if this problem is specific to the photo upload. Maybe it concerns all upload when there is no space available.

		Steps to reproduce Enable instant uploads and set the camera folder with default google camera Take some photos/videos Actual behaviour Anything is uploaded Expected behaviour All the content is uploaded Environment data Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Model number SM-N910F Security Patch Level: 1 July 2016 Kernel version: 3.10.40-7733605 Camera app: default Samsung camera, version 3.0 ownCloud server version: 9.1 Checked in other Android versions, Samsung devices, camera apps and the problem does not happen. It seems to be a problem related with the storage location from camera and photo/video taken Notice this device doesn't have slot for SD Card; due to that, the app stores always files in main storage, and the option in the app to select storage volume is disabled.

		Actual behaviour When using a site with an untrusted SSL certificate, I get a &quot;the identity of the site could not be verified&quot; pop up as expected. However, when I try to click the &quot;Yes&quot; button to dismiss the popup (or even &quot;No&quot;), the app doesn't dismiss the popup. Expected behaviour The app should dismiss the popup when I press either &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Yes&quot;. Steps to reproduce Open up owncloud app Type an server address with a self-signed certificate Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) Nope Environment data Android version: 5.1 Device model: Motorola Moto X Stock or customized system: Nope ownCloud app version: 2.1.2 ownCloud server version: ownCloud 7.0.4+dfsg-4~deb8u4 (Debian) (stable)

		Steps In app, login in an account In server, delete the account In app, select the account in drawer or in account manager Redirection to login view The account does not exist anymore, so credentials will never work (username is non-editable). If you tap on &quot;Go Back&quot; button, the files view or settings view (depending whether the app has more accounts or not) is shown for a little while, but you are redirected again to login view. It is a bit annoying to switch to another account or tap on &quot;new account&quot;. Expected behaviour? Switch to another account, or to login view if the app has no accounts. The question is if server side answers in the same way if the credentials have changed and if the account is removed to detect these two different cases.

		Changes in the device orientation can lead to an indefinite spinner in the share dialog. It's hard to isolate the specific condition that is triggering this, but it's happening often. Steps to reproduce: Select a file and choose to share it. Change the device orientation. Repeat and retry this 2 steps until the load spinner stays stuck. After this happening once, it's reproduced systematically. Current behavior The Loading... spinner stays in focus forever. If you try to click the back button, the app doesn't respond, and a couple of minutes after closing it, crashes. Expected behavior Spinner should be displayed while getting the share settings for that file and a timeout should be triggered if these settings cannot be pulled from the server. Test environment Android 6.0.1 on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4

		Steps Connect to Wifi Setup the Wifi to auto-disconnect on lock (when the screen locks itself, it will disconnect from Wifi completely and never reconnect until unlocked) Unlock the screen Go to Google's picture app Select many pictures Share and select the ownCloud app Select a destination folder and start the upload Let the phone aside and see the cloud icon in the notification bar, it's uploading Wait for phone to auto-lock, wait longer, go have coffee Come back to phone, unlock it Check notification area Expected result Notification area must display a permanent message &quot;Upload failed due connection problems&quot; or something similar because Android disconnected the Wifi when the phone automatically locked itself. Actual result No notification at all from the ownCloud app. Two times I thought it successfully finished uploading and when I checked my pics folder from the laptop there were missing pictures. Versions ownCloud server 9.1.3 ownCloud Android app 2.2.0 Android Nexus 4 mobile phone with Android 5.1.1 @davivel even holidays have their bug reports 😉

		Steps Navigate into a deep folder From another app, upload some stuff using the &quot;share&quot; feature and picking ownCloud Wait for upload to finish and all notifications to disappear Now I want to go have a look at the upload list Expected When inside a deep folder, I'd like to have a way to go to the main menu. Actual No way to go to the main menu directly. Need to click the &quot;Back&quot; button on the top left of the mobile app until I reach the root folder. Only then can I access the upload list. I'm not familiar with the regular Android app design, maybe the current approach is an existing and acceptable design pattern. Now you might say that it's not a common use case to want to access the finished upload list and that it's ok to have that menu item there. To be discussed. @davivel @owncloud/design

		Note: I usually use vimtouch to open text files Install vimtouch (or any other text editor) Upload some text file &quot;test.txt&quot; from another machine In the ownCloud app, navigate into the folder of the file &quot;test.txt&quot; Hold on the &quot;test.txt&quot; item (we want to edit but don't want to view the file with the built-in viewer) Use the &quot;three dots&quot; menu to select &quot;open with&quot; but be clumsy and tap a bit on the left of it Expected No trash icon so close to &quot;three dots&quot; Actual Risk of tapping the delete icon when aiming for the three dots menu. Note: in general I'm not too happy to have to use this menu when editing a file. But due to the new built-in viewer I need to do more manual action to be able to open the file in an external editor. (maybe I'll make another separate report)

		Hi, Actual behaviour Since I have updated my S7 Edge to Nougat 7.0, the auto-instant upload does not work any longer. I mean nothing happens not even the cloud icon appearing and throwing an error, nothing. I have tried reinstalling the app, restoring the phone to factory settings, try to check on wifi only or no, nothing is working. That's a shame considering the role of a cloud application. But it works well on my other phone a Huawei P9 Lite running Android 6.0.1. Steps to reproduce Setup the app to autoupload photos and videos take a photo check that nothing is happening Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) yes Environment data Android version: 7 Device model: Samsung S7 EDGE Stock or customized system: STOCK ownCloud app version: 2.3.0 ownCloud server version: 8.2.10

		Actual behaviour Tapping on an upload notification does nothing Expected behaviour Tapping on an upload notification does something :) Steps to reproduce Tap on a completed upload notification in the notification tray, or open the Uploads activity in the Android client Owncloud Android app lists all uploads Tap a (completed) entry I hoped this would do something, like open the folder, as I'd like to: Rename the file Share the file Opening the file isn't necessarily useful by default as I likely already have the file locally, though maybe useful in a long-tail, but the default tap would definitely be if it from opening the target folder, hopefully even showing/selecting the new file. I've already navigated the tree once to upload the file, perhaps useful to not have to do that again to manipulate the uploaded file? Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server?

		I'd like to be able to configure instant uploads from the &quot;Screenshots&quot; folder, in addition to Photos and Video. At that point it may make more sense just to allow arbitrarily many instant upload sources, rather than incorporating more and more specific use cases as they arise and polluting the configuration menu.

		Hi all. I have just stumbled across this while looking for an alternative to Dropbox camera upload. I have an owncloud server set up and working on Ubuntu 16.04 and I can connect to it find, add, download, delete files etc no problem. I have tried using the &quot;instant upload&quot; option but I just can't seem to figure out how to get it to work. I set the path to my camera folder and take a photo and absolutely nothing happens in the app whatsoever. Nothing gets queued, nothing uploaded, no errors, nothing. Dropbox syncs the same photo fine. I am pulling my hair out trying to figure this out and I can't find anything in the manual while would help. I am using a Galaxy S7 and my camera is set to save to a 64GB microSD card. I tried changing back to phone storage and set that folder in the owncloud app but it makes no difference. PLEASE can someone help?

		My daughter own the phone at subject, with Android 7. I've the latest OwnClud official app, 2.3.0, with OC 9.1 (but it is not a OC trouble, there's not even the start of the upload, nor images in the upload queue). Using filemanager i've verified that images got in correct folder (/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera) that are specified in the OwnClud app as camera folder. I've looked here, there's some bug opened similar to that, but all claimed to be fixed, or at least seems to me so. Sorry if not. Thanks.

		We are currently working on publishing the beta app in FDroid, so it would be a good moment to start to do the same in Google Play Store. There are two ways to set up beta tests in Play Store: Closed beta: to run a test with small groups or if we know the exact users we want to test the ownCloud app. Users in this test group can be managed by email address and only they will receive updates for the beta version (via link). Open beta: to run a test with a large group, anyone can join the beta program and submit private feedback. Since ownCloud app is in live production version, users can opt-in to the beta program from the app details in Play Store (It's possible to set a maximum number of beta testers) In none of the options, testers can submit public reviews. AC Decide: closed or open beta // Open beta Decide Feedback channel (let the users know how they can provide us with feedback): email address, private feedback through Play Store (only for open beta), github repository, central. // Apps email Prepare beta release Create open release beta in Play Store. Upload a the beta signed apk. Add beta release info in Play Store. Send beta release to review. Publish beta. CC @michaelstingl @jesmrec @davivel ❤️ 1

		Actual behaviour Trying to start the app wil result in a message saying: owncloud crashed. Instantupload and file sharing cease functioning as well. Expected behaviour App starts without crashing. Steps to reproduce Start the app. Owncloud seems to function again after restarting the phone. However, once the app starts crashing again, it becomes dysfunctional again - I.e. I need to restart the phone for it to function again, there is no workaround. Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server?

		Actual behaviour Working with the Owncloud app stops working suddenly, now I get the error &quot;SSL initialization failed&quot;. I tried to delete my account in the app, now I'm not able to reconnect to my ouwncloud server with the same error: &quot;SSL initialization failed&quot;. The problem came up after an update of the phone's OS (at least I think so). The device is a Blackberry Z10 which is able to run Android apps since there is an special Android layer within the OS called Android Player. Using the web interface of the owncloud server from within the browser on the phone works. I'm pretty sure the problem lies in the server's SSL configuration. But I'm not able to find the cause resp. to adjust the settings. And I haven't access to all config data since it is a shared server. Test on https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ gives A+ Expected behaviour Of course I would like to connect to the server using the app. Steps to reproduce In the app try to add a new account Type in the server address: https://....

		I see this in build.gradle This project was started in Eclipse and later moved to Android Studio. In the transition, both IDEs were supported. Due to this, the files layout is not the usual in new projects created with Android Studio / gradle. This file merges declarations usually split in two separates build.gradle file, one for global settings of the project in its root folder, another one for the app module in subfolder of root. Guys, Eclipse and Android are no team any more, and this makes no sense since 2015 ! I would like to make an PR to change project structure with an app directory, like most Android apps are, but when I see how much open PR's are there I see no chance doing this. Am I right ?

		Dear developers of the owncloud/android project, We are MSc students from the Delft University of Technology doing research on why builds break in open source projects. To do this, we are analyzing Travis build statistics and build history of owncloud/android. By analyzing the build history of owncloud/android, we found the following: The project has 16.1% failing builds in the history The project has a average amount of build failures compared to other similar projects When looking at owncloud/android’s build metrics, we could not find clear factors that are highly correlated with this result. To identify the reasons behind build breakage, we would like to collect developer insights into the reasons why build breakage occurs. If you have five minutes, please answer the survey we have created. Your response will be very useful in our study. Thank you.

		Actual behaviour -Cannot login with app. After testing the connection and entering credentials, I am taken back to the login screen. Environment data Android version: 4.3 Device model: Samsung Note 3 ownCloud app version: ownCloud beta 2.5.1-beta-1 ownCloud server version: latest, cannot check now I don't have the logs, anyway this behavior is repeated both with the ownCloud server they set up at work and with my personal one. Notice that in both instances Solid Explorer can login and access the files without a problem, though it doesn't have a sync function. The Windows client also works without a problem on both servers. p.s. I'm using the beta version because it seems that you have to pay for the regular one... I don't want to pay only because this app never really worked for me, every time I go back to it to check, I just cannot login. Although in a previous version it would crash on the attempt, so that's somewhat of an improvement.

		App version 2.5.0 does not recognise the 10.x server version. Server is 10.0.3 while app says &quot;min. 8.2 version has to installed on server to share&quot;. Therefore no additional sharing is possible. Usernames which were added to the share list earlier are listed and can be deleted. Creating a share link works, too. Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) Not possible to test because there are no other local users on this test installation to share with.

		Steps Select multiple files for upload Go to uploads section Expected File sizes displayed for all files Actual size only displayed for files not currently uploading. For any file currently uploading or waiting for upload, the size is hidden. Why ? My use case is that I'm uploading on a slow network and would like to be able to estimate how long I need to wait until I can stop forcing the phone to leave WiFi on by using the phone (because wifi auto disconnects and resuming loses progress, there's another ticket for that). Even better would be to show how much was already uploaded vs bytes total. I believe the desktop client does that. Optional is a speed measurement. Version 2.5.0

		OCFileListFragment, and all the other fragments that derive from ExtendedListFragment are still based on ListView instead of RecyclerView. This may cause issues with huge file lists. @cdamken Could you test this on a cloud with many files in one folder?

		Since we are going to include several important features in the coming release, we could include them in our new wizard, but just for the users that update the app from old versions to 2.7.0. Features to include: Pattern lock. Fingerprint lock. Gif support. Upload pictures directly from the camera. CC / @jesmrec TASKS [GIT] Create whatsNew_2.7.0 branch from whatsNew. Create new resources for the different steps to include. [GIT] Merge branch whatsNew_2.7.0 into master.

		Through this issue here we came to the conclusion that we might need new pin designs in order to keep UI consistence. We tried to take an approach equal to what was suggested here for the iOS version. Instead of showing two labels when a file is marked offline available and downloaded we only show the marked as offline available, since that will make sure that the file is downloaded anyway. This is what it would look like ❤️ 1

		It's not really a problem, but I find it really annoying having to manually upload my photos because instant upload dosent have the feature to not upload when using mobile data, I still want to have access to my files when on mobile data, so no the fix is not going to options a disabling it.

		It would be great to have this feature included in our side menu for example, as suggested here. There's a pretty old PR, #737 that follows a different approach, creating a specific activity to show the quota. Although we can use the library PR maybe, owncloud/android-library#102 and take advantage of GetRemoteUserQuotaOperation TASKS [LIBRARY] Get quota from the server by using GetRemoteUserQuotaOperation. Already merged via owncloud/android-library#102 [APP] Get quota when getting user profile info and stores it in DB.

		Actual behaviour When trying to log in using the android application (version 2.7.0) entering https://cloud.chillstice.com yields the message: Secure connection established; however, when logging in with the correct credentials it tries to log in for 3 seconds and fails with the message: Unknown error. The desktop client works fine and the ownCloud panel accessible at cloud.chillstice.com works properly. Expected behaviour The application should log in like I was able to do many times before moving to a subdomain. Steps to reproduce Create a subdomain redirect to the directory ownCloud is installed in. Try to connect using the new address with the android application. Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) NO :C Environment data Android version: 7.0 Device model: Samsung Galaxy S7 Verizon (SM-G930V) Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 2.7.0 ownCloud server version: 10.0.7.2 Logs Web server error log No relevant errors ownCloud log (data/owncloud.log) No relevant errors More Info Today I finally figured out how to properly create subdomains and how to set ownCloud to be accessible under the 'cloud' subdomain. I changed the config.php to include the following:   'trusted_domains' =&gt; 
  array (
    0 =&gt; 'chillstice.com',
    1 =&gt; 'cloud.chillstice.com',
  ),
'overwrite.cli.url' =&gt; 'https://cloud.chillstice.com/',
'htaccess.RewriteBase' =&gt; '/',

 Then I ran 'occ maintenance:update:htaccess' The SSL certificates for the subdomain have also successfully been updated and are live. I only started having this problem after setting up the subdomain.

		Actual behaviour In https://central.owncloud.org/t/android-instant-upload-with-multiple-accounts-select-target-account/7427 a user reports that in a multi-account setup they can not select the account to which photos shall be instantly uploaded. The photos are currently only going to the last account which was used. This means that they end up in the wrong folder sometimes. In nextcloud it seems to show the same behavior: nextcloud/android#440 Expected behaviour Users should be able to select to which account they want to upload, either after taking a photo or in general. Steps to reproduce Take a photo Go to the ownCloud app and select another account Take another photo look where they have been uploaded to Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server?

		Currently, the &quot;descending&quot; option to sort the file list is placed within the action bar menu as following: We can improve this behaviour in two different ways: By changing the wording to Sort descending , so only the word Descending can be confusing By setting the option in the same dialog as the sorting method, in the bottom as a checkable option: CC @michaelstingl
