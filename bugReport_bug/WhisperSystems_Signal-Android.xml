			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		This has been happening randomly for me lately, I assume it's since the latest update. My passphrase is cached, and when I go to open TextSecure, it opens to the most recent conversation. Hitting the back key seems to just close and re-open the same conversation. The only way I seem to be able to open the conversation list is by killing the two TextSecure processes from the running apps list. Then when I restart, if I enter into a different conversation from the list, exiting that conversation by pressing the back key, brings me back to the most recent conversation again, not the conversation list. I think it might be worth noting also that deleting the conversation thread that persistently shows (most recent...usually...I think), doesn't solve the issue, a blank/new thread with the same contact is shown in place of the deleted one. If it helps, I've got a Sony Xperia S LT26i running Android 4.0.4 If there's any other information I can provide, just let me know here. Thanks! :)

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Using version 0.7.4 from Google Play. TextSecure instances of two communicating users seem to disagree on whether a secure session is established. How to reproduce: User A and User B do NOT have TextSecure installed. User A installs TextSecure. The &quot;automatically complete key exchanges&quot; option is ON. User A attempts to initiate a secure session with User B. User B installs TextSecure. The &quot;automatically complete key exchanges&quot; option is ON. User B attempts to initiate a secure session with User A. At this point, User A's device believes that the secure session IS established, but User B's device believes that the secure session IS NOT established. An encrypted message sent from A to B will show up on B's device as Message encrypted for non-existing session.... User A aborts the secure session with User B. User A attempts to initiate a secure session with User B again. At this point, User B's device believes that the secure session IS established, but User A's device believes that the secure session IS NOT established. An encrypted message sent from B to A will show up on A's device as Message encrypted for non-existing session.... User B aborts the secure session with User A. User B attempts to initiate a secure session with User A again. At this point the cycle repeats.

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		I noticed that when sending a group message, textsecure opens up my 3g connection (instead of wifi) and tries to send it as an MMS. Why? It usually fails because MMS has always been flaky on my phone. Besides which, I'm trying to send text not mms (usually unencrypted to people who don't have textsecure). After digging though the issues on here I found out about the stealthy &quot;go straight or right turn&quot; broadcast/conversation switch, which sounds like it will do what I want, but i thought I'd still log it anyway.

		Greetings, Just to be short and sweet, whenever I attach a photo to my messages, it distorts the image. This happens with a portrait or landscape shot. I reliably see this on my G2X running Gingerbread, and on my new HTC One with Jelly Bean. I haven't tested sending video too much, but when I receive video it seems like a compressed low quality version. When I use the stock messaging apps on both phones, images send clear and undistorted. I can receive photo attachments just fine though. Thanks! .:Tory

		Basically, remove the password to your database, make an &quot;encrypted export&quot;, import that export. You will have a password prompt that you cannot get past unless you force kill text secure, then the next time you start it the password prompt will not be there. I suspect there are a few solutions. The easiest is to disallow encrypted export of unencrypted data. An alternative is to prompt the user for a password when exporting unencrypted data (or maybe always?) Oh and of course the password prompt bug for unencrypted databases could go away :)

		If you send a text message that includes a URL and you have a default action specified for that protocol, the action is performed on the release instead of allowing you to choose an action from the context menu. For example, if you have a default browser and send the text: &quot;Check out this website: http://www.google.ca&quot; If you LongClick on the text (anywhere, not just on the URL), you will see the the context menu appear with 4 options, but as soon as you release, the browser will open. Pressing back from the browser does not allow you to select one of the context menu options. The only work around I've found is to use 2 fingers and choose the option you want with the other finger before the browser opens. If you don't have a default browser, you can hit back to open the context menu after the 'open with...' dialog appears. No other applications should be launched on a LongClick.

		Phone A and B have registered themselves to use data channel. Phone B gets into some form of conversation with Phone A just to guarantee a session exists and Phone A is aware of Phone B's identity. Phone B deregisters, clears data, starts over again and reregisters to data channel. Phone B starts new group with Phone A as member. Phone A sees the new group, but also sees a separate conversation start with a click-to-confirm for the new identity. When you click to confirm, you get a dump of the encoded group action message as if it were a normal text.

			<description>
		In the most recent version (version 2.0) with the Dark Theme selected, the textbox that one types a message into uses a black font on a dark background. This makes it very hard to read while entering your message. Once you hit send, the text is shown with a white font, which is much easier to read. To increase readability, could we switch this font color to white while entering a text as well?

		My carrier and some other companies sometimes send SMS with alphanumeric addresses. When TextSecure receives them, it shows sender as Anonymous. Also, it won't import them from system database (i. e. SMS will not show in TextSecure in any way). I have saved few such messages on my phone (Galaxy Nexus) and I know a tiny bit about Android development, so if there anything I can check/send to help resolve the issue, I will be glad to help.

I had this before the 2.0 update, but there it could be fixed by recreating the thread manually. This fix doesn't work with 2.0+ anymore, which is really annoying because I can't send messages/SMS to that contact.

The SMS in question is still listed under the conversation with A and has never shown under the conversation list of person B in TextSecure. I have not tried to send an SMS with TextSecure since for obvious reasons, and have reverted back to my default SMS app (Hangouts) with which I have had no problems.

Choosing one of the TS supported entries, the full list of phone numbers (home, fax, work, work fax, mobile1, mobile2 etc.) for this contact is presented for choice. (See also #1011 and #990.) Unfortunately, there is no indicator for which of these numbers (for example, in the case of more than one mobile phone number) a contact key is stored. It is also not possible to check the phone number in TextSecure &gt; Contact Keys &gt; Manage Identity Keys as only the name of the contact is shown but not the specific phone number associated with it. I would like to suggest that the TS supported phone number should be emphasized (marked by a green bullet or something similar).

On his phone, messages to the group are displayed in a group thread and he can decrypt the messages. No group avatar is displayed, the name is 'unknown group'. We both can exchange direct messages just fine. Maybe this is caused by missing the initial group creation message (all particpants at that time running 2.0.3)? How can users fix this, as there is no possibility to leave this empty group? Only by abandoning that group and creating a new one?

		Since there is no issue for this yet and it has popped up across several other issues, we should discuss this. I think that &quot;data&quot; would be a good replacement in the U.S. language. In the U.S., people explicitly pay for &quot;data&quot;, so they know what that is. In German for example, this should be translated with &quot;Internet&quot;, though, since no one here would use the word &quot;Daten&quot; for mobile internet. So I guess this is at least partly language-dependent.

		Alice is in Ireland. Bob is in Colombia. Carol is in the UK. They resolve to use Text Secure because SMS is too expensive. They all appear to register their numbers successfully, and all of them successfully begin to use push messages. Alice (or Carol) start a new group and add the others. Alice can see both Bob's and Carol's messages, and can send messages to the group, which appear to be sent. Bob can see both Alice's and Carol's messages, and can send messages to the group, which appear to be sent. Carol can see Alice's messages, but cannot see Bob's messages, and whenever she sends messages to the group, they appear to be sent. They try to message each other individually. Alice can message both Bob and Carol. Carol can message both Bob and Alice. Bob can message Alice, but cannot message Carol. His messages don't arrive, even though they appear to have sent. None of them really understand what could be going wrong at the protocol level.

 there is no loop around it, so why use += ? a fqn name is used to call the method, instead of using an import

		Trying to switch family members from WhatApps -- bummer: I get their messages, and I can send off messages to them, but they do not get my messages. I remember when setting up the app on their phones I did not set a password to protect the local message base, but I did so when setting up the app on my phone. Probably more important difference is that I am on a Dual-SIM Huawei (with second SIM currently switched off though) while their Samsung phones are all single-SIM. So far, I have tested only on wlan (yes, when setting up TextSecure on all phones, I &quot;registered&quot; the phone no of the active SIM card, so all phones should be able to use wlan, not just SMS). Any idea what I could do so they get my messages? Thank you! -mgkai

		Hey, first of all thank you very much for your effort of developing such a great app! For my installation of TextSecure (2.0.5 on Android 4.3) it seems that the on/off-Switch to override system MMS settings does not work. Speaking for my particular case: if I enter the &quot;MMS Preferences&quot; Section the checkbox is checked. I may uncheck the box and return to the main menu. If I then go to &quot;MMS Preferences&quot; again, the checkbox is still checked (so it seems as if the change was not saved). In addition, I may not uncheck the checkbox again but reveice the following notification instead: &quot;Manual MMS settings are required for your phone.&quot; If I return to the main menu AGAIN and go to the &quot;MMS Preferences&quot; Section again, I may uncheck the checkbox... still, it does not seem to be the case that my changes are saved. Sidenote: changing the MMSC URL, MMS Proxy Host and MMS Proxy Port seems to work - at least the values entered are still there once I re-enter the section. Thanks for your support - I hope my description is precise enough to be of help.

If I open the message from the main textsecure interface it doesn't crash though. Device is a Samsung Galaxy S4.

When not typing (no keyboard displayed), everything is fine. expected behavior: A colored send button with a padlock indicating whether the message will be encrypted is displayed while typing. (Just as when not in landscape mode.) possible solutions: Can TextSecure modify the Android landscape keyboard? If yes, then the send button should be adapted. If not, maybe collapse the keyboard instead of sending when in landscape mode? That way, the TextSecure send button would be displayed (and would have to be pressed to actually send the message). While not ideal, this should at least avoid accidentally sending unencrypted messages.

Eventually, I did a bit of googling, and the comment WhisperSystems#190 (comment) made me think to quit and reopen the app. I removed the app from my app switcher, opened a task manager to ensure it had quit, and then reopened the app. It then accepted my password on my first try.

		Hi, I tried several time to send a message to a new contact or number with the plus sign. I added the contact and number, wrote the text and can't sent it, apps telling me that it's not a valid number, for every number I could write. I work with an Acer liquid Gallant Duo on Android 4.0.3 not rooted and the last version of textsecure available, any ideas? Thanks

		I encountered this with a friend of mine who reflashed his phone and subsequently reregistered. I had an ongoing chat (using his old key) with him and noticed today that he had sent me a message yesterday and I had to accept the new key. But I didn't get notified about the new message in the notification bar I would expect Textsecure to generate notifications for all events including the key changed event, since this may lead to unnoticed messages, depending on usage pattern of course. If this behaviour is intentional, it would be great to know the rationale behind this. Anyways I want to thank you for your amazing work! Steps to reproduce: User A and User B both register with Textsecure Both Users exchange a couple of messages User B reregisters with Textsecure changing his key User B send User A a Message No notification is shown on User A's device Expected behaviour: User A should be notified of the incoming message with the new key

		Hi, A friend and I are using TextSecure 2.0.8. I'm running Android 4.4.2 and he's running 4.3. We've exchanged dozen of encrypted messages in the past and everything worked fine. A few days ago, I sent him a message with an image and he replied. It worked as expected. Then I replied with a text message. It was sent as a regular SMS, the bubble color was green. (I was in a place with very bad 3G signal). Instead of receiving the message I sent him, he received a key icon, then a couple of hours later, what looks like encrypted text : He then sent me a message that appeared to be sent correctly from his side (blue bubble, nothing special), but appeared as &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; from my side. I replied him, the message appeared to have been sent correctly from my side (blue bubble, nothing special), but he received a &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; too. From this moment, all the messages we exchange are received as &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot;. Here are his logs and mine : https://gist.github.com/tbalthazar/7afe026443ee266cb4fb Please let me know if you need more info. Cheers, Thomas.

		One time, after TextSecure crashed then I immediately reopened it, it asked me for my password, then when I entered the wrong password it still opened like I had entered the right password. I'm sure the password was wrong. This could have been because the password was cached already even though TextSecure thought it wasn't. I don't know.

		I have a somehow special setup. As I use my mobile phone for business and private contacts I do not send my number when calling in general. So I have switched that off. For people that should see it's me calling them I have added the *31# GSM code in their phone number in the contacts so that my number is shown to them. (I do this because I have to take hotline calls from time to time and calling them back should not show my number). I now tried using TextSecure and found that when I type in a number that's in my contacts (and I type the number without the *31#) TextSecure automatically finds it and takes the number with the GSM code in front of it. Thus no SMS ever gets send because the taken number does not work on SMS. Would be great to have the GSM code filtered away, thus I could use the Contacts (which is also not possible with the standard SMS app with my setup) fully or at least just take the number I've typed into without looking it up further (this is how the standard app behaves). If there is any more information needed just let me know. kr Tom

		I have noticed (through several TextSecure versions running on Android 4.1.x and now 4.2.2) that if I select the second-last message in certain threads and delete it, it will reliably delete the last message instead. If I scroll up to the top and try to delete the first message, it'll delete some message below, but not the second. Same with trying to delete the second message. It doesn't happen in all threads. I have one huge thread from &quot;Anonymous&quot; (various services that send messages from names like &quot;LM-VODAFONE&quot;, for which the sender shows up in TextSecure as &quot;Unknown&quot; in &quot;Message details&quot;), and that's where I've noticed it most often. I realise this is a rather vague report, but I'd be happy to try and help with debugging if anyone has ideas for things I should try.

		So, I sent my friend an unencrypted SMS message. For whatever reason, TextSecure crashed and restarted. When I logged in, I tried to respond to him, and found that suddenly he was secure (blue messages/arrow). I'm not sure how, since he wasn't before. I haven't confirmed to make sure that he's using the app, but I don't think he is. Sending him a few messages (encrypted) failed. When I try to end the secure session, I got an error (the triangle icon): Secure session ended.

		I have noticed a strange behavior of Text secure on Android 4.2 and 4.3.1 which seems to be reproducable. A certainly correct password was not accepted by textsecure this happened not only to me but also to an acquaintance of mine. Both passwords ckntakned special charakters Like äüö¥π#.. Both devices are Samsung Galaxy s4 minis

		Sorry if this was already reported somewhere, didn't find anything using the search. I just noticed that when you receive an image without any text in a message, the belonging notification just displays the sender but nothing else. WhatsApp solves this by displaying &quot;John Doe - Picture&quot;, so that you know what's going on. This probably concerns the other attachment types as well (didn't test it though). My suggest would be to follow the example of WhatsApp and just display the type of the received media.

		I've had an ongoing issue where I'll receive an image in a text message, but it will display as an image I had already received from another sender. The new image just never displays. Contact A sends me a picture of her kids. I can view it. Contact B sends me a picture, but the thumbnail is the same as the image from Contact A. I touch it to open it in my pictures. It opens as the picture from Contact A. Contact C sends me a picture. It comes through normally. Contact A sends another picture. It comes through as the picture from Contact C. Also, I've noticed that if someone sends a picture to a group, 99% of the time I get no thumbnail (just an empty box), and a &quot;Media not Found&quot; error when I try to open it.

		I experienced this Problem with two Contacts in my List. They are unable to send me messages. Instead i get: &quot;Received corrupted key exchange message!&quot; and so do they, when I try to send a message to them. Ending the Secure Session via the Lock Symbol didn't change the Situation. This behavior started some time after I switched from Cyanogenmod 10 to Cyanogenmod 11 with a Factory Reset. But all other TextSecure Contacts except the two mentioned, kept working fine. I also refreshed the Push Directory several Times after the Error started to appear but it didn't change anything. Device Info: Nexus S, CyanogenMod 11-20140608-SNAPSHOT-M7-crespo

		I've been using a group message with two other TS users successfully for about a week. Today, one member appeared to leave the group. They could still send to the group and from their side, it looked like they were still in the group, but from both other participants, no messages were going through to the third person (K in the images). Messages from K to the group were seen by all, but messages from B and J were not delivered to K. Creating new groups with both the same and different participants had the same effect. K would leave the group upon sending of the first message from B or J. Screenshots are from B. K is using a HTC One X (ATT) with Android 4.1.1, HTC Sense version 4+, HTC SDK API 4.63.

Since the update, if I leave the app unlocked, it will not ask for the passphrase even after remaining unlocked for hours. Manual lock works fine, so it's something wrong in the timeout.

		I'm new to using TextSecure and I'm sorry if this is a dupe but I couldn't find a similar issue. I just made TextSecure my default messaging app and when trying to download an MMS image, I receive &quot;Error connecting to MMS provider...&quot; I used the following manual MMS settings, as found in my phone's system menu (##3282#): MMSC URL: http://mmsc.vmobl.com:8088 MMS Proxy Host: 68.28.31.2 MMS Proxy Port: 80 A debug log can be found at http://hastebin.com/idofelenev I think the log cut off the attempt to download MMS with the proxy, but in previous attempts it looked similar.

		ISSUE: On one of three phones of our family, Text Secure (TS) is not working: First, after setting-up TS it connected to push-messages however, phone could only communicate with another phone with secure message in one direction (sending) but couldn’t receive from any of the other two. Checked to use number with country code, enabled Gapps, rebooted; no luck. Tried to disable push-messages and received error: “Error connecting to server!” Deinstalled TS and reinstalled it again. Now, the phone cannot register with TS at all. Registration fails, because phone does not receive any sms with the required code from TS server, instead error message appears with something like &quot;Network connectivity error ...&quot; and TS recommends registration with call message. When doing it, registration code is noted and when enter, TS tells us &quot;Network connectivity error ...&quot; and registration fails. Updated to latest TS 2.1.9 and still the same issue. I’ve reported it on Support Centre here: http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/8356686-can-t-disable-push-messages-un-register-from-textsecure- And was asked to post it on issue tracker. DEVICE INFO: First used TS 2.1.6, updated to TS 2.1.9, Nexus4, Android KitKat 4.4.4 CONNECTION: Data (like the other two phones, which do work) APP STATE: Default settings DEBUG LOG: Issue on TS 2.1.9: http://hastebin.com/qinudigafi Issue on TS 2.1.6: http://hastebin.com/quzuvigugi

		The SmsReceiver_currently_unable_to_send_your_sms_message message is toast continuous if the wifi network is connected without internet access or the network is unstable. it toasts the message all the time while we are in a group conversation, besides that all the members will received many repeated messages if you do not force stop the app. if (systemStateListener.isConnected()) scheduleQuickRetryAlarm(); seems systemStateListener.isConnected() return true but have no internet access.

		There is a small text in the ConversationActivity after creating a group. At the moment (after changes regarding AppCompat It think) it's not easily readable with white text on the light-grey background. I think it should be changed back to dark grey like before.

		I have experienced this issue several times in the last few days and was able to reproduce it. I have only experienced and verified this issue with messages containing pictures, text-only messages seem to work as expected (apart from not beeing resent automatically via push when internet connectivity comes back, but that's a different issue). System: Android 4.1 rooted Samsung stock ROM TS 2.3.2 TS settings: Push messages: enabled Receive all SMS: enabled Receive all MMS: enabled Allow outgoing SMS to: TextSecure users: enabled Ask before sending SMS: enabled Non-TextSecure users: enabled Witnessed behaviour: When trying to send a picture on a spotty connection, TextSecure fails to send it via push and asks to tap the message to fall back to MMS. I tap the message and click no when asked if it should fall back. The message then shows the red triangle with the matching text that the message could not be sent. I now select the message and go to details -&gt; resend message. TextSecure does not show the &quot;please tap message to fall back&quot; dialog again, instead the message stays in the failed state with the red triangle. When the internet connection comes back, the message is sent via MMS Expected behaviour: If the internet connection is still not available TextSecure should ask for permission to fall back to MMS once again, as it does with text messages. To reproduce: disable wifi+mobile data follow the above procedure from step 2 to 5 enable wifi+mobile data again you might have to wait several minutes or select the message and choose resent instead Log: https://hastebin.com/ipogomogov.vhdl I have another log ready if needed, but I'd have to scrub this one first. I consider this a serious bug because it can lead to rather significant unexpected costs as MMS are rather expensive (at least in Europe) and even more expensive if you are roaming.

		When I send a message in this groupchat it SOMETIMES displays &quot;Error sending message&quot;. If I then check the details of the message it shows that it tried sending by MMS. However the other people in the groupchat do receive the message and do so as a push message. In the TextSecure settings I have SMS completely disabled (and so by extension also MMS). My TextSecure version is 2.3.2. I have an Cyanogenmod rom installed. This is the link to the part of my logcat where I tried sending a message in the groupchat that I got by adb (I deleted the phone numbers): https://gist.github.com/lamade10/29b322679d2f1260ab71

		Recently as I got a new phone, I experienced some issues with group messaging. As I cannot say, how far they are related, I'll just describe, what happened. First of all did a backup of the messages on the old phone. Tried to unregister push on the old phone. This didn't work with some rather generic error message (something like &quot;unable to perform task&quot; or so, don't remember exactly). Installed Textsecure on the new phone, registered for push. Imported backup from the old phone. So far, so good. The hassle began, when the first group message arrived. The message is shown in a conversation named &quot;Unknown group&quot;. There's no way for me to change the group name or even leave the group to be readded. After someone else has added me to the group a second time (although I was already part of the group according to his phone), I can see the group name and receive messages – but only from the one who readded me. Messages from other members are not shown. However, now I can leave the group. After being readded again, I can now receive all messages from any group member again.

		Over the past week or so, I have been getting phantom push message notifications. By phantom, I mean an &quot;encrypted message&quot; notification appears, but then the are no new messages after I unlock text secure. Initially there was only one phantom message, a day it two later there were two, now there are six. They seem to appear shortly after time text secure locks itself. Edit: Have confirmed that the phantom notification appears immediately after (manually) locking textsecure. Device : motorola XT1045 (peregrine_retus)

		After I upgraded from 2.3.3 to 2.4.0 I have difficulties selecting some messages. Not all messages - it seems to be just those messages where TextSecure recognises a phonenumber in the message text. When I long-press such a message and release my finger from the screen the selection disappears. To select such a message I have to long press, don't release my finger, press another message in the thread so I select 2 messages and then short-press the last one so it leaves the selection. Update: I tested this on 2 devices, one no-name cheap Android 4.2.2 which does not have this problem. A Sony XPeria Z1 Compact with 4.4.4 does have this problem.

		My sister's phone wasn't able to send/recieve MMS messages so I checked things out. When I entered the manual settings that I copied from the default SMS/MMS app on her phone it worked. I believe that one setting is set wrong and all the others are ok. provider: Tušmobil WRONG: MMS Proxy: 91.185.221.085 OK: MMS Proxy: 91.185.221.85 I wanted to open Pull request and correct the setting myself but wasn't sure which is the right file to edit.

		Hi folks, when i try to select an attachment (picture) at the conversation while pressing &quot;ON&quot; the picture, it gets marked but as soon i release my finger from the screen the picture automaticly gets unmarked. After repeating the following steps 5-6 times he finally catched my selection. BUT! When i mark next to the picture, on the blank screen, it gets marked immediately. U need a log for this?

		Running the latest TextSecure on an LG Optimus F3Q, I am no longer able to focus the button to compose a new message using the keyboard on the phone. I seem to have no trouble focusing any other elements on the screen, I just can't find this button. I was able to focus the button in the previous version, but I can no longer find it with my arrow keys as of today. I was able to find it by exploring the screen with my finger using both Talkback and Spiel screen readers, but in both cases, the button has no label associated with it, and is now presented to me as simply &quot;button.&quot; In order to make best use of this app using my screen reader, the button needs to have a content description associated with it that would allow me to know what the button does. If possible, it should also be able to be focused using a hardware keyboard, whether built in or external.

However, it works just fine if the text field has any text in it. Can anybody reproduce this on their model?

			<description>
		Created contact with two phone numbers. First phone number does not have TextSecure capabilities (not a smartphone). Second phone number has text secure and is registered for push messages. TextSecure (option selected to use TextSecure as the default SMS application) correctly creates two threads (one for each of the numbers) and can receive TextSecure messages from the second number. However, when attempting to send messages to the second number , only the &quot;Send unsecure SMS&quot; and &quot;Send secured SMS&quot; options are presented, so TextSecure messages can not be sent to the second number. Moving the second number to a new contact allows TextSecure to present the option to send TextSecure messages. Moving the second number back into one contact again prevents the &quot;Send TextSecure message&quot; option from being displayed.

		On my LG G2 smartphone, TextSecure is having problems associating my contacts to the conversations. Instead of using the contact image and name it will show the standard &quot;happy face&quot; and the phonenumber the conversation is related to, as if I did not have any contact stored for this number. It should be noted that many of the conversations are correctly associated with the correct contact and thus shows both image and name from the contact. It seems to be rather random what contacts are effected by this bug. I have also seen conversations that was previously associated with the correct contact &quot;forget&quot; this ones a new message arrives, and just show the &quot;happy face&quot; and number instead. I have tried updated the contacts and adding the phonenumber to them again (even adding them several times to the same contact). In some rare cases this made the contact show up correctly, but normally it does not fix anything. I have not been able to find a common course for the problem yet. It does not matter if a contact have only one or several phonenumbers. Also note that the standard message app on the phone works as it should, and shows all conversations with the correct contacts.

Other group members did not yet approve his new identity. Whenever the user with a new identity sends a message to the group, users who didn't yet accept his new identity receive a &quot;private chat notification&quot; asking them to confirm his unknown identity or cancel. after confirming each &quot;confirm identity&quot; notification, the message which was supposed to be delivered to the group is delivered to the private chat instead of group chat. no idea about future messages, but i believe they would be delivered normally to the group after confirming the identity.

		Tapping on a TextSecure notification with multiple senders now opens something that says it's a group chat with 0 members, rather than opening to the ConversationList. I assume this is a regression caused by the RoutingActivity change. I don't know what happens if you try to respond in that group thread, but it can't be good. We should probably try to get a 2.10.1 out asap.

		Hello, I am just submitting this issue just in case you will stay with the Google Emoji set, instead of changing the Emoji set as requested over there: WhisperSystems#2892 I assume the Emoji set used for the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer is the Google Emoji set residing over there: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/tree/master/assets The Google Emoji set there is an old version of the Google Emoji set though. The Google Emoji set recently has been updated, for more details see: http://blog.emojipedia.org/android-50-emoji-changelog and: http://blog.emojipedia.org/209-new-emoji-flags-available-today So, in case you should stay with the Google Emoji set, please update it to the latest version.

		Hello, the Emoji drawer in TextSecure currently is using the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emoji set. A lot of Android phones do not have the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emoji set as their native system Emoji set though. Samsung uses their own Emoji set, LG uses their own Emoji set, HTC uses their own Emoji set and so on... You can see some of those Emoji sets over there: http://emoji.codes/family Unfortunately though, TextSecure does not replace the native system Emojis with the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis, when the native system Emojis are not the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis, like on Samsung, LG and HTC devices for example. So, when Samsung/LG/HTC users tap on one of the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis in the TextSecure Emoji drawer, a Samsung/LG/HTC Emoji appears in the message input box and in the messages themselves, and not the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emojis the user actually selected. So, could you please replace/overwrite the Emojis in the message input box and in the messages (and everywhere else where it is possible) with the Emojis that are being used in the Emoji drawer? Telegram for Android also has a built-in Emoji drawer and also has built-in Emojis. And Telegram for Android does replace/overwrite the Emojis in the message input box and in the messages (and everywhere else where it is possible) with the Emojis that are being used in the Emoji drawer. So it is possible to do it. Could you please fix this and do it like Telegram for Android is doing it? Regards

		Hello, when toggling between the keyboard and the TextSecure Emoji drawer, the TextSecure Emoji drawer appears above the keyboard for a brief momen and &quot;fades&quot; into the keyboard, which looks like a glitch and is uneasy on the eyes. In Telegram for Android, that does not happen. In Telegram for Android, when toggling between the built-in Emoji drawer and the keyboard, the toggle happens instantly, the Emoji drawer instantly replaces the keyboard, without any transition or whatever, which looks much smoother. In TextSecure it currently looks buggy and is quite uneasy on the eyes. Could you please fix it? Regards

This issue may be related to #840. You can find the log here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bbb8be8f2e0fb06821f3

Did this a few more times and once the image preview was entirely blank (but still took up the space it should), clicked on that too, crash. While in this crashable state I attempted to reproduce this using a different attachment, no crash. Thinking it may have had something to do with cache I tried another different image that definitely should not have been in cache, also no crash. Eventually through some multi-step process I can't recall I was able to stop the error image from showing up for that one attachment and thus stop the crashing. debug log &gt;&gt; https://gist.github.com/anonymous/266cafd4ee10f5f3e380 crash E/AndroidRuntime(14933): FATAL EXCEPTION: main

		This came up in #3046 briefly. Sometimes when you delete a picture it will leave around ghost thumbnails that are visible in the system gallery and also in TS attachment gallery. This can lead to the following issue if you try to send the deleted image: Delete a picture that's on your device with shell or a file manager (or create a ghost thumbnail in some other way) Attach that picture to a TS message using the attachment gallery's Recent tab (the gallery does not know that the picture was deleted) You will get a missing thumbnail icon Tap send TS will create an &quot;empty&quot; message that gets stuck in a pending state for eternity If you try to do the same in Google Hangouts you will get a 'Can't find picture' notification and you cannot send the image. TextSecure should also check if the file exists and not trust the gallery viewer. .gif demonstration: TS 2.12.0, stock Android 5.1 and Android 4.0.4

		If you leave a group the thread is not deleted but you lose the ability to type in the input box and send messages. [1] I assume this is the expected behavior as you might still want to view past messages after leaving. However if everyone else leaves the group you can still do everything: type text, add attachments and send messages. This makes no sense since there are no recipients anymore. The thread should be &quot;locked&quot; as in the case above where you are the one who leaves. Adding more people (updating group) should &quot;unlock&quot; the conversation again. There are many issues about groups but could not find anything about this case. TS 2.12.0, stock Android 5.1 Edit: Here's a debug log after the following steps: Open TS first time after boot Go to a group All the other people leave the group (in this debug log all the other people = one person) I send a message to the empty group ([1] You can still type using the TS emoji drawer. Also you can add attachments. But it might be best to add this as a separate issue.)

		This is such a minor issue that it feels almost a sin reporting this but sometimes details are important. Currently the default led notification color is green. However the only green left in TextSecure are the message bubbles when using unencrypted SMS. Otherwise TextSecure is all about blue now (icon, UI, push messages). Therefore the default led color should follow suit.

		You know the little pulsing bar that appears when writing something in a text box? (I'm sure i thas a name but I can't think of a better description right now). Since 2.14.1 (probably 2.14) it has disappeared from textsecure. This obviously makes it hard and uncomfortable to write messages.. I like textsecure, and I appreciate the effort you're putting into it, really. But do you even test the app before releasing updates? Missing commas that screw the phones and make us lose messages, huge usability problems that would've taken 10 seconds to notice... I mean... of course it's human to forget a comma or introduce bugs, we all know it. The problem is that testing should be considered fundamental, even when you have beta testers. Beta testers are supposed to find smaller problems, not sacrifice their product for the sake of bugs. That's what the developers should be doing. Apologies if it sounds rude, and thanks again.

Scrolling usually fixes the issue or moves it to another contact. It seems that if you dismiss the keyboard (step 3) quickly it increases the likelihood of missing avatars.

		Some TextSecure emojis are not used in Android notifications. Here's an example message that I received from a strange number. The message contains the AIRPLANE (U+2708) emoji which is displayed differently in notifications and in TS: Lock screen notification: Notification drawer: Heads-up notification: And finally the actual TextSecure message: The meaning of the message changes completely depending on the emoji set used. Now I don't know if I should report this unknown sender to the authorities (like the good, law-abiding citizen I am) or just wish this person a safe trip. I'm not certain if the emojis in the notifications can even be changed but I'm under the impression that WhatsApp does show it's own iOS-like emojis in Android notifications.

		On the textSecure panel showing the list of threads, each of them has a field showing the time elapsed since the last message. typically I read something like &quot;11 mins&quot;. I wonder what the s after min stands for. Unit for minute is min, and units do not take plural form. Unfortunately I must say that this trend of putting plural mark to units is more and more common in the US, and it appears that it is getting more common in other countries as well. Spreading that nonsense is definitely not good so I suggest that the &quot;plural unit issue&quot; be taken care of as soon as possible. Check also for the hour, I am pretty sure that soon some &quot;hrs&quot; will show up. &quot;h&quot; would actually be the best, while &quot;hr&quot; being also accepted. Thank you

		Hello, using TextSecure 2.16.3 on an LG G2 running latest stock ROM (Android 5.0.2 Lollipop), the height of the Emoji drawer does not match the height of the system keyboard. The Emoji drawer is higher than the system keyboard (tested with Google Keyboard from Play Store). Could you please fix that and make the height of the Emoji drawer equal to the height of the system keyboard? Regards

		I first noticed this after the recent update to the Photos app. When sharing from within that app, a toast notification says &quot;Sharing to TextSecure...&quot; and the message composition process continues as expected. When sent, the message disappears. This bug does not happen when the sharing process is started from within TextSecure through either the paperclip icon or the &quot;Add attachment&quot; menu option.

		I am running into a problem trying to send a picture on my 1st Gen Moto X running 4.4.4. I'm using TextSecure 2.16.4 in data mode. I took a photo in potrait mode using both the camera app and the in-app option to take a photo. Both times the message will appear in the text window but fail to send. Here's a log from immediately after the failure https://gist.github.com/anonymous/52824d6ed48b2be2a32f I verified that I could send a different photo (in landscape mode) and captured another debug log here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7f056f9973425195b26c I have tried closing and reopening TextSecure without success. It seems specific to this photo as other photos (both taken on the phone or from other sources) are able to be sent. I'm not sure if it's the subject (as other issues mentioned grass being hard to compress) or the orientation of the photo. This seems similar to #3070 or #3028. Also seems like this might have just recently been fixed in version 2.17. Sorry if this is a duplicate. Picture here

		When viewing the conversation list, all mms group conversation icons only display for THE FIRST PERSON listed in the group chat. If a image is available, it will display only one contact image, otherwise if an contact image is not available, the the first letter of the first contact's first name is shown. I would like to see group chat icons in the conversation list denoted with a tile view comprised of the group contacts (possibly up to 4 tiles). It seems the special TextSecure groups have a stock grey icon to denote those type of chats since they have a group title/name. For example, if there are 3 contacts in the group MMS (2 friends plus yourself) the visual icon on the conversation list would show a vertically split tile view of your contacts photo or the Letter of their first name if a photo is not available. For reference, is similar to the Google hangout view. [][] [][] [ __ ] [][] [][] Consider similar feature for the special TextSecure group icon. version 2.16.4

		Sometimes I receive an MMS (over push) when I am offline; when I finally come back online, I get the MMS message with two different received timestamps. My guess is that one timestamp corresponds to the time sent, and the other time stamp corresponds to the time received. This seems to be confusing and unnecessary information for the user, who probably only cares about when the message is sent, and doesn't understand why the time stamps are different. Device info: Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, stock android 4.4.4, TextSecure 2.21.0? (I compiled from b7492eb) App state: Push registered, incoming SMS disabled, outgoing SMS fully disabled Debug logs: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/98fe3fb59609cd429909 Example here where the last picture received has a timestamp difference of about 4 minutes, because that's how long I was offline. Both of these screenshots were taken within a minute of each other.

		Hello. Ever since updating to 2.22.1 I've had problems with TextSecure freezing. This almost always leads to a box that says &quot;TextSecure isn't responding&quot; and regardless of what I do at that point, it crashes 8-10 seconds later. At first I thought WhisperSystems#3624 might still be spooking, but I don't think it's related. The camera crashing was always instantaneous, and usually happened when I flipped my phone. Now it happens out of the blue. Yesterday it happened while writing a message to a person who wasn't even writing back at the moment, which means it can't be WhisperSystems#3642 Samsung Galaxy Nexus Kitkat 4.4.4 Paranoid Android TextSecure 2.22.1 Started happening with latest update. Never happened before. The picture shows what happened right before it crashed. I was about to add an emoji and then everything freaked out. https://gist.github.com/d145fd936f2ebda89015 https://gist.github.com/514168cd604f1ead7faf

		There are some bugs in group conversations when following these steps. Two parties, ＃1 and ＃2 ＃1 disables Textsecure-messages in settings ＃2 creates a group conversation and invites ＃1 ＃1 enables Textsecure-messages in settings ＃2 sends a message in the group conversation This scenario resulted in four found bugs The first message that is sent by ＃2 in step 4 is not received by ＃1. When a message is successfully transmitted, the group thread appears in ＃1 chat list. But it doesn't have the selected thread name. It uses Unnamed group. Pressing the &quot;show members&quot; icon will not display any members. (Major problem) ＃1 can't open the keyboard. Pressing the emoji icon will open the emoji drawer but it is not possible to press send. Attaching a file is also possible, but it is not possible to press end. Device info: Samsung Galaxy S5. Android 5.0. Textsecure 2.26.2. Sony Z3 Compact. Android 5.1.1. Textsecure 2.25.3. App state: Push registered. Enable/Disable Textsecure-messages. Log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f47acfb7b705db94e712 Related issues: WhisperSystems/TextSecure-Browser#274 I am investigating what causes this problem. Would appreciate any comments/advice, specially on the 4th bug.

		This morning I tried to establish a couple of secure calls between two Android Signal phones. Only the first time everything worked fine; however, thereafter everytime, after having successfully established a connection, my phone would not transmit anything I said nor would I hear anything my friend said. It's as if my phone was dead, even though the app indicates are normally functioning call. I adjusted my phone's volume during such calls, it doesn't seem like the volume had been set to zero or something. A couple of times the connection would sort of disappear with both phones stating in the top bar that a phone call to an unknown recipient was active (clicking on that notification gave a screen identical to the one depicted in WhisperSystems#4234.) In the most recent attemts to call my friend her phone wouldn't even ring anymore In case someone found the time to have a look, here are the logs. My phone (Signal 3.0.3, Android 4.2.2): https://gist.github.com/4ed595aa929def90900a and (most recently with the failed call initialization) https://gist.github.com/a2ac6019b5f7ec93c826 Other phone (Signal 3.0.3, Android 4.1.2): https://gist.github.com/7bc9ccc7422fa9709896

		There is one particular group I'm in in which no messages I write on my Android phone sync to Signal-Desktop. As far as I can tell only this group has the issue. I also get an error when sending, but it doesn't show any particular problem. When I click on the error symbol in the message, there isn't an error next to any contact. When I go into the message detail view via long-press -&gt; info, then it shows the &quot;resend&quot; button next to every contact. Bit strange, really. This group contains a user who unregistered from Signal. adb logcat from when I pressed the send button until sending was completed and I got the error message on the phone: https://4z2.de/signal_faillog_ipahqu2Shoh6.txt (manually cleaned, because it's from adb logcat - I only anonymized the phone numbers)

		Since version 3.7.2, it is impossible to open multiple links from a conversation in separate browser tabs, as every link will be opened in the same tab and so, overwrite the previously opened link.

			<description>
		I have a few contacts that still have Signal installed in hopes of bugs like WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS#421 being resolved but do not prefer Signal for their daily driver until the application is usuable for them. Which for users that are experiencing this iOS bug, the application is insanely frustrating to use. Signal rightfully defaults to messaging being secure. However, when I switch to insecure for this contact, move to another contact the method of delivery is still insecure. This is also true the other way around. If I switch that contact back to secure and then go to the contact that prefers insecure (iMessage conveniences etc.) then the delivery is set to secure. Steps to reproduce: Open Signal contact &quot;A&quot;, send insecure message Open Signal contact &quot;B&quot;, message defaults to insecure Change delivery of message for Signal contact &quot;B&quot; back to secure. Switch to Signal contact &quot;A&quot;, message delivery now set to secure due to action in step 3 I would like to see a per-conversation or per-contact preference for delivery of secure vs insecure. An additional &quot;remind/confirm insecure messages in x days/hours&quot; would also be awesome.

		Updated (2016-02-27): Version: 3.12 Nexus is ok. x5pro still misbehaving. The bug is likely in the rom. But since there are so many affected devices and related regressions as system and apps are updated, I'll keep this issue open unless told otherwise. 2016-02-23: Version: 3.11.1 Affected devices: Nexus 4 and Doogee X5 Pro. Stock unrooted roms or rooted roms regardless. Possibly dupe of: #1037 This used to only affect the x5pro but now the nexus recently shown the same bug. Also, Whatsapp doesn't display this bug so this is likely a Signal issue \ workaround-able android issue. Previously: Notes: Version: 3.8.1 This is was originally thought to be an OEM related bug. Now it's been confirmed on two separate devices from two separate OEMs. One of which is running a custom ROM... Also, I have no idea how process and memory management actually works in Dalvik\ART so the terminology section is my ad-hoc attempt to work around this. Terminology: Foregrounded: Visible. Full-screened. &quot;The running&quot; app. Backgrounded: Closed. Still visible in the Recents tasks list. Shown to be running under in Settings-&gt;Apps-&gt;Running Apps. Daemonized: Closed, Not visible in Recents. But still shown running as a service in Settings-&gt;Apps-&gt;Running Apps. Killed: Closed, Not visible in Recents. Not shown under Settings-&gt;Apps-&gt;Running Apps. Scenario: 2 clients; 1 Nexus 4 (works as expected), 1 Doogee X5Pro (misbehaving). Working: 1. When both phones have Signal foregrounded, messages pass back and forth smoothly and instantaneously. 2. When Signal is Foregrounded on one phone while backgrounded on the other, a notification appears correctly. 3. When the Nexus has Signal daemonized after being swiped off Recents, while the X5pro is sending through a foregrounded Signal, a notification appears correctly. 4. When the X5pro has Signal backgrounded, notifications appear correctly while the Nexus is sending them through the foregrounded Signal client. Not-working: Swiping off Signal from Recents doesn't daemonize the process. Instead it's killed and Signal messages fail to transfer. SMSs still work (I'm guessing a separate android daemon\service handles that). Extra-credits: When remaining opened under Recents, Signal is indicated to occupy 26mb. When daemonized it's 6mb. Since I have no idea how Dalvik\Android actually manages memory, I can't say if that's address space (virtual memory) or resident memory or just what the Dalvik's process heap is pointing at... TLDR: Seems on some phones, swiping off Signal from the Recents tasks-list doesn't daemonize properly. Instead, Signal is closed off entirely and Signal messages fail to transfer. Edit: Updated reflecting further feedback. And version.

This only occurs when the conversation the message is a part of is currently open. It doesn't occur if a different conversation is open or if Signal is in the background. When you re-open the app the message that caused the crash will display properly. This affects both Signal conversations and regular SMS conversations with Signal as the SMS client.

		Contact list displays names with accents in the wrong order resulting in people named &quot;Álvaro&quot; being sorted after &quot;Zacarías&quot; (not able to attach image at the moment). I think COLLATE LOCALIZED in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/contacts/ContactsDatabase.java (line 150) will do the trick but i'm not a programmer. According to what I've found: [LOCALIZED] It instructs SQLite to sort non-ASCII characters appropriately. Chars with diacritics (some call them accents) have higher byte codes than the character Z, so a plain ASCII sort wouldn't fit to many foreign languages. For example, the capital A char's byte code is 0x41 and the capital Z char's is 0x5A. Then we have the Á (capital A accute) which code in Unicode is 0x00C1. So a plain byte code sort would result the Á to be after the Z. But in languages that have this kind of characters the convention is to put those with diacritics as if they didn't have the diacritic. So the Á should be together with the plain A, at least before B. And to illustrate, we have below a list of names sorted using their bytecode: Brenda
Debby
George
Álvaro
Érico
 Now using the COLLATE LOCALIZED it would sort by the &quot;base&quot; of the character: Álvaro
Brenda
Debby
Érico
George&quot;
 Thank you very much for your great work.

		Phone numbers from the Faroe Islands have length of 6 digits. The land-code is +298. If I enter my number into the app, f.x +298 123456, the app will return the connectivityFailureLayout. However, if I type my number with a zero at the end (+298 1234560) it will work. This is not pratical, as all my contacts will not be able to contact me encrypted, because I always will reply with my normal number, and not the one with a zero at the end. I'm searching around in the source code, and when debugging the application, I find that the problem is maybe not in the app itself, but in the online service. Here's one log from the app: Opening URL: https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/v1/accounts/sms/code/+298123456 And then the app receives a warning: org.whispersystems.textsecure.api.push.exceptions.NonSuccessfulResponseCodeException: Bad response: 400 Bad Request And if add a zero to the end, the 400 Bad Request error goes away. I suspect you have a minimum requirement for at least 7 digits to be typed, but could you edit that to 6?

		When I try to send a picture taken with &quot;camera&quot; under attachments in Signal nothing is actually sent. Everything is the same as it should, except when I try to send the picture the message is blank. Adding a message to the picture only sends the picture. This only started happening this morning when I installed the latest beta. Open a chat Click attachment icon Click camera Take a picture Accept picture Send the picture Blank message Moto G (2015) Android 6.0.0 Signal is the last beta https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aec4ccbbf8c887ab2b0e https://gist.github.com/anonymous/212ba2b19eba908789a1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Sending a large Image (f.i. 13MPixel, ~6MB .jpg) to a Group doesn't resize the Image to a lower dimension and filesize. When you send the same Image to a single Contact in contrary, it -does- resize the image. This leads to a large amount of traffic use on both ends. Group images should ideally be handled the same way as single contact images. In a perfect version, the user should be asked for whether it should resize the image or not. This issue has actually been found and fixed 1 year ago here BUT it is still happening in the latest Version of Signal: #2913 Steps to reproduce create a group, add one or more contacts. send a large image (13 MPixel / ~ 6 MB) to this group. Actual result: The Image is not getting resized and Signal sends a whole 6 MB image to the group. The group receives (and has to download) a full 6 MB Image. Expected result: You actually send a resized image (1280 * xxxx, ~200 KB) to that group. The group receives and downloads just a 200 KB Image.

		After the app expires, there is no message to the user that it expired. Only messages simply fail to be send. The only way to discover that the app expired is to see in the debug console: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.TextSecureExpiredException: TextSecure expired (build 1455264177834, now 1463091540114)
 I think this should be more user friendly. Moreover, it would be great if this could be display also few days at least before the expiration. So that user can react in time. 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal was working without problems on latest Android 6.0.1 on my Nexus 6. Today I've &quot;dirty&quot; flashed the latest Android 7.0 Preview 5 image. I have wiped the cache partition afterwards. Signal is working on Android 7 Preview 5, but when I click the paperclip button to add an attachment, Signal freezes immediately. The blinking cursor in the text input field stops blinking and the app does not respond to any further input. After closing the app by swiping it off the recent apps list, Signal can be opened again. The same happens if I select the respective menu item instead of clicking the paperclip button. Steps to reproduce Open Signal app. Enter a conversation. Click on paperclip button or select respective menu item to add an attachment to the message. Actual result: Signal hangs/freezes immediately. The cursor stops blinking and the app does not respond to any further input. Expected result: The &quot;attachment selection dialogue&quot; is shown, so I can select an attachment to be added to the message.

		Hi, build 3.18.0 has introduced the ability to select (and delete) notification messages. For group update messages there is a bug. If you select one the save button becomes visible. (Further on it can be clicked. The same procedure like for media messages will be initiated. However I don't know if really something is saved.) Solution: Hide save button for all kinds of notification messages. Please note that only the notification messages of self initiated group updates are affected by this bug. Notification messages of group updates from other group members are not affected. Found in build 3.18.1. 👍 1

The opposite also happens sometimes, but this started happening with Signal 3.20 so I assume it's an Android issue. Steps to reproduce Turn off your phone and computer (or Chrome at least) Have someone write you some messages Start both Actual result: Some messages will appear properly on Desktop, but won't show up at all on Android. Expected result: All messages should of course appear on both devices.

Steps to reproduce change the group avatar to a new photo Actual result: group avatar is stuck to some old avatar (possibly from another group) Expected result: group avatar should change to the new image Device info Device: bq Aquaris E4.5 and Nvidia K1 Android version: 5.0 and 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.21.0 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/f7514791daed60132fd95e57d387e236 This is kinda shitty report.

		It is impossible to set it up in New Caledonia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_New_Caledonia). The app shows an error &quot;Connectivity issue&quot;. I had a look to the logcat, and the app sends a request to the server with this url: https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/v1/accounts/sms/code/+687xxxxxx If I access it in a browser I get this reply from your server: {&quot;code&quot;:400,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;HTTP 400 Bad Request&quot;} Then I tried a phone number from France and accessed the url https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/v1/accounts/sms/code/+33xxxxxxxxx And it works (well I get an empty response instead of a &quot;400 Bad Request&quot;). There definitely is a server issue not accepting New-Caledonia 6 digits numbers.

		Dear Devs, First kindly accept my kind gratitude for including the voice note feature in Signal Private Messanger for Android. Here, I am reporting a minor issue which can easily be fixed. The Record button or mic button is improperly labled. In the left of the bottom part of the window, there is the 'emoji' button. then, there is the edit box followed by the 'toggle attachment' button. After that, there is the record button I think. but our screen reader (Talkback) announces it as &quot;toggle attachment&quot; button. That's why, we visually challenged persons are getting two 'toggle attachment' buttons, which is a bit confusing. Kind regards, Pradip 👍 2

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I was testing &quot;Support for stickers and scribbles&quot; (1b44bdc) on a phone that has (only) 768MB of RAM. The picture to be edited was a 3000 * 4000 pixel (w * h) ~1.9MB jpg. Tapping confirm after minimal editing resulted in a OOM error. I got back to the conversation screen and conversation list by tapping the Android back button. Entering the conversation again from the conversation list then let me sent unsecured SMS only, which is a bad experience. Fortunately &quot;force stop&quot; Signal solves the issue. I wonder if the process would succeed if pictures were scaled before editing? Sending the same picture without prior editing works as expected.

We observed this problem within multiple group chats and was triggered by distinct senders. (I personally observed it in two distinct group chats, friends also confirmed this in other group chats.) Note: the sender did not press any of the &quot;RESEND&quot; buttons. Steps to reproduce reproducing the exact network failure rates/environment is not really possible, but here are the simple steps sender: try to send a message while the 3 dots show that the client attempts to still send recipient: displays the same message (by the same sender) multiple times Actual result: Message is displayed multiple time (between 6 and 15 times in our cases) Expected result: The recipient detects that this is the identical message (via a message id, replay protection?) Device info Sender's Signal version: 3.25.3 and others Recipient's Signal version: 3.25.3 and others 👍 5

 Original issue was about something else that was already fixed in the beta release at the time of reporting. The original issue was turned into this issue from the second comment. Original issue below for posterity: I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description App crashes. Steps to reproduce Unable to reproduce. This happened twice within a short timespan as I was using the app. Strangely, the action I was performing at the time (1st crash: sending a photo captured within Signal to a group conversation, 2nd crash: responding to a text message to a single contact) was successful both times, even though the app reported that it crashed. Actual result: App crashes and has to be relaunched. Expected result: App should not crash, messages should be sent. Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.25.4 Link to debug log 1st crash: https://gist.github.com/cec3a81959ce454cce66fab9da1644db 2nd crash: https://gist.github.com/a2cddcbc9aeb725918025e7b14e0e991 PS: I also submitted the Google app crash report thing, not sure if that's useful to the OWS crowd.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal sometimes crashes when I open the app itself, or when I open a conversation. It started when I sat in school, about to die from boredom. A Signal contact sent me a picture of a bird with a message like &quot;Wow this bird is fat&quot;. I originally saw this in the preview on the Signal &quot;homepage&quot;, so I clicked the chat to show the picture and... Crash! After this I've had 1 more crash after opening Signal, so I think it's something with the picture. Steps to reproduce I have no clue really, but if I had to guess I would guess something like Receive a picture Open Signal Click the conversation before the picture has fully loaded Crash Bandicoot makes his entrance! Actual result: It crashes Expected result: It shouldn't crash Device info Device : motorola Moto G (4) (athene) Android : 6.0.1 (64, MPJ24.139-63) Memory : 43M (32.03% free, 192M max) Memclass: 192 OS Host : ilclbld87 App : Signal 3.27.0 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0e05640f6a27c58c11e53cfaa734c4b2 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10bc16289a8bd8fc12905233ed7828ac 😄 1

The apps can only be restored to work with deleting all data via the android settings. Expected result: The best would be support xlsx files to be supported. The minimum requirement in my opinion is that the app rejects shared files that are not supported and doesn't keep crashing in this case. Screenshots n.a.

Repro steps below demonstrate this for contact color syncing, though blocked number sync messages are similarly affected (see screenshots from Chrome's debugger). Steps to reproduce Edit a contact number so it includes punctuation, such as parentheses, spaces, or dashes. Refresh the contact info in Signal (see that the punctuated number is rendered in the conversation header). Change the contact's color in signal Actual result: Signal Desktop becomes confused and fails to save the change in contact info or blocked state. Expected result: Signal Desktop correctly updates the conversation color.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I'm experiencing an issue with regular unencrypted MMS messages. Signal will receive and display the MMS message normally however after another 3 days it will display the same message a second time even though the sender only sent it along once. I switched my phone back to the stock SMS app (Google Messenger) for a while to see if I could reproduce the same behavior. Google Messenger displays MMS message a single time as expected. This behavior has been consistent for me since I installed Signal and it does not seem to matter what phone OS (Android or iOS) or messaging application (iMessage, etc.) the sender is using. Possibly related issues: #6003 #5525 Steps to reproduce Get a friend to send along a single MMS message Notice that the MMS message is received and displayed by your phone normally Wait 3 days Notice that the MMS message is received and displayed by Signal a second time Actual result: Single MMS messages are being received and displayed twice by Signal. Expected result: MMS messages are only received and display once in Signal. Screenshots https://goo.gl/photos/jFyRb3jeS8s9sshZ8 Notice the sent and received dates of both images.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When I am typing a message and moving the cursor around to fix a typo, every now and then the cursor is not responding as it should. You select a position in the message, try to delete a character (by hitting backspace). However not the character at which the cursor is pointing is removed, but the last one in the message. Continuing to correct most of the time results in a crash and restart of Signal. A work around is to exit the message and go back to the entry screen (message saved as draft) opening it again and continue the message. Not sure whether this is a quirk in the keyboard app or in Signal. I have not experienced this on my previous phone (Experia Z3 with Experia keyboard), so it might be keyboard related. Steps to reproduce Unfortunately I have not been able to come up with a sequence of steps to trigger this. A range of messages go OK and then for some reason this weird behaviour occurs. Actual result: Signal crashes Expected result: Signal should not crash on typing or correcting a message.

Both devices are running Signal beta 3.30.4. Alcatel has explicitly enabled &quot;video calling beta&quot; feature. Blackberry has it implicitly enabled, as per moxie0's comment in #6272 (&quot;You don't see that settings, it's on by default for you&quot;). [btw, before beta Signal 3.30.3, the Blackberry showed &quot;Login failed!&quot; when trying to place a call; now, from 3.30.3, no more &quot;Login failed!&quot;]. If, instead, I call from the Blackberry the Alcatel, on the Blackberry it seems all ok, ringing tone, but the Alcatel doesnt ring, and shows a missed call just after the Blackberry stops the ringing tone, manually or because of the timeout. Texts and attachments work ok on both directions (A-&gt;B, B-&gt;A). Alcatel device can place and receive audio calls correctly to/from other Signal accounts.

The problem is that while the phone always beeps when she gets a new message, the beep is often really quiet/short when the screen is on and she's already in a conversation with me. &quot;In-conversation notifications&quot; is enabled, which is why it beeps at all. However, it seems the message is marked as &quot;read&quot; too quickly, so the beep is interrupted. My mom is old and she just can't hear the beep which means she can't respond right away when I'm texting her at the supermarket or whatever. Steps to reproduce Receive a message when your screen is on with the chat open, make sure &quot;In-conversation notifications&quot; is enabled in the settings Most of the time the notification beep is really short, which makes it easy to miss Actual result: The beep is seemingly interrupted Expected result: The beep is fully played, just like you'd expect it to Device info Moto G3 Latest non-beta Signal Android 6.0.1 Link to debug log Don't think this is necessary, but if it is just tell me and I'll post one

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I ended a new call by pressing the hangup button instantly after the starts (sonar sound just started playing the first time) Then the call was ended (no more sonar sound) but the WebRtcCallActivity was not closed. I just sat there waiting for nothing(?) After letting it ring some seconds (2 sonar pings) The hangup works as expected. And afterwards the this bug is not reproducible. But leads to this crash: #6348 (comment) Not sure yet, if this is the same issue... (will merge into 6348 if so) Steps to reproduce start Web RTC call press hangup immediatly after the button ist visible maybe helpful for repro: the recipient's Signal was not receiving any incoming call, cause it got and stayed killed after Debugging (Android Emulator) Actual result: Sometimes WebRtcCallActivity stays active, nothing more happens Expected result: WebRtcCallActivity gets closed Device info Device : Sony E5823 (E5823) Android : 6.0.1 (2701308494, 32.2.A.0.253) Memory : 36M (16.24% free, 512M max) Memclass: 192 OS Host : BuildHost App : Signal 3.31.2 Link to debug log After cleaning out the leaks, here you go: https://gist.github.com/McLoo/0074df6170a3b8d6856d5c69c89b7122#file-gistfile1-txt-L360 (I left WebRtcCallActivity and the Convo by back-button. Then locked Signal, to access the &quot;Submit Debug log&quot; faster) https://gist.github.com/McLoo/e5c6c93596a632b5dece6942fcbf1179#file-gistfile1-txt-L337 (left WebRtcCallActivity and the Convo by back-button, then Settings-&gt;Submit)

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When listening to an audio or voice message ends, the screen turns on and the touchscreen accepts input, despite the phone still being next to the ear, after listening to an audio or voice message. This leads to unwanted calling and other actions, the user never intended to do. Steps to reproduce Start listening to an audio or voice message. Hold the phone next to the ear, so that the screen turns off and input from the touchscreen is ignored. Wait for the audio or voice message to end. Actual result: The screen turns back on and input from the touchscreen is no longer ignored. Expected result: The screen stays off and input is ignored, as long as the phone is next to the ear.
