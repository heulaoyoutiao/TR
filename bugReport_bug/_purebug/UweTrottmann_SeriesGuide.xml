		As this field is not formatted in any way it may read: 8 pm 8:00PM instead of: 8:00 PM SeriesGuide should at least handle those two (add additional formats and try to parse with them). edit: This makes me think if SeriesGuide should switch to trakt.tv as a data source completely...

		Not that critical because you have to choose 'Allow' in the browser each time. You can always go back to the app. Investigate if this can really happen (I guess if no valid code is sent back, the task will just try to authenticate with GetGlue again, and again, you get the idea).

			<description>
		Hello everyone, I'm trying to figure out why the SeriesGuide app keeps crashing everytime I run it. I tried installing the app via google play and downloading the apk from github. I tried all the available apk and the result is always the same. Conditions: Samsung Spica running a custom 2.2.3 20 Mb available on the phone memory. App is installed and running from the phone memory No network available. What happens The app starts, and for a few seconds it works but then it crashes. The logcat says it died with the Signal 11 (SIGSEGV) I can see the Get started Screen. If I don't do anything it will keep crashing with the signal 11. If I click the dismiss button on the Get started Screen I can play around with the app for a few seconds (2 or 3). After a couple of relaunches I start seeing SQLite errors (could't open seriesdatabase for writing) Any thoughts?

			<description>
		With how the suggestion system is currently designed in Android it is as far as I researched impossible to add per-activity filters like one can do by overriding onSearchRequested() for regular search. An alternative would be to turn off suggestions for search inside OverviewFragment, but guess what, AFAIK not possible. If anyone has viable solutions, I'm listening. E.g. you could create another SearchActivity which handles just searches from OverviewFragment. This way you could specify a different selection. However I still have only the user query as dynamic parameter, no?

		The TVDb search API exposed to third-party applications is much worse than what is offered through their website. Shows are not found for partial title Shows are not found where only a non-English title exists, except if the search language is expressly changed to that language (e.g. SG 'Content language' setting) No autocomplete Examples: PSYCHO PASS C Money Control Hopefully the promised new API will solve these problems. Update: trakt is planning v2.0 for mid-2014 with potential international support and better search. Hopes are up!

I found if I tried to first type some other symbol (say &quot;=&quot;), it wouldn't display, but the text also didn't disappear, and now typing a dash also didn't cause the text to disappear. Fix the filter. I had a look at the filter for the text field, but couldn't find anything wrong so far. So far it resets to &quot; &quot; when entering a dash or an uptick. Allow dashes (check if the create id algorithm will not fail and still produce uniques).

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		When I unwatch the last episode seen in a show, the next episode SeriesGuide tells me to watch is not the good one. (SeriesGuide version 7.2-beta1) Steps to reproduce the bug: Add a show (I'll take Family Guy for example as it has a lot of episodes). Let's say I have seen the whole season 1 and the first episode of season 2, so I flag them all as seen. Next episode SeriesGuide tells me to watch is now 2x02, as expected. I accidentally flag episode 2x02 as watched. I then flag episode 2x02 as not watched yet in the seasons section. Go back to the main screen (when you see all your shows), SeriesGuide now tells me that the next episode of Family Guy I have to see is : 11x04 (???) To go back to normal, go to the seasons section of the show, find season 11 and, with the action button on the right, flag all the episodes as &quot;watched none&quot;. You can reproduce once again that bug by flagging the next episode to see as seen and flag that episode as not watched yet. SeriesGuide will always tell you that, with my example, the next episode to see is 11x04. Why 11x04? I don't know... Looks like that bug happens to the shows with multiple seasons (I can reproduce this problem with Simpsons show, Futurama or The Wire). I don't know if I was very clear with that bug, I'll provide a video if needed.

		After changing the filters, it triggers an update. This should NOT happen, as this is handled completely by the loader framework and this code has remained untouched a while. Misinterpreted bug report. Show list cutoff for unwatched episodes is not refreshed on activity re-recreation as old loader is apparently re-used, ergo the cut-off is not updated to the current time, ergo shows with just released episodes do not show up.

			<description>
		It's possible for the FAB to be displayed on the &quot;now&quot; tab as a result of the FabAbsListViewScrollDetector getting confused about which Fragment is currently being shown. Personally, I don't like hiding the FAB, but I'm not sure how you'd like to handle it. An easy fix would be just to check to see if the grid has focus or not:     if (!view.hasFocus() || totalItemCount == 0) {
        return;
    }
 Also, what are you thoughts on switching to an actual Snackbar instead of your custom one? Is there a reason for using it?

		Like outlined in this issue here the calculation of the estimated runtime is slow. The problem is you have to keep the device screen on while calculating else it will reset and start over. Which is kinda bad if it takes 15 seconds or more to calculate. Same thing if it calculated and you switch of the screen.

		As actions are now published as broadcasts previous versions of SeriesGuide no longer work. Update SeriesGuideExtension to handle both cases, probably by checking the component that is sent which should receive the action. If it's a receiver, send a broadcast, if it's a service, start the service (only pre-O of course). Better idea: send API version through extra. Use that to decide.
