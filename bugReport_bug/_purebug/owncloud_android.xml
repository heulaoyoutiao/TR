		The show-password toggle »eye« only works as a one-way toggle, and it’s not possible to hide the star with asterisks by clicking it again. Should work. (Tested with the version from https://ci.tmit.eu/job/ownCloud-Android/ )

		Every now and then after entering the apps security PIN I don't get to my owncloud root directory but get the configuration site where I should enter the URL and access details of my ownclod account. This is quite annoying as entering URLs and passwords with special characters on the mobile keyboard is rather unhandy. Also after successfully reentering the account data it looks like the app does a full rescan of the file database which can take a while and eat a lot of battery depending on the size of the data in your owncloud. The version of my app is 1.3.14

		Every time the client Instant Upload feature is activated, I get a success message, but the file stored on the server is truncated, and so can not be displayed on the web interface or on computers syncing this folder. After more tests, this is not an instant upload issue. All files I try to upload from the android client are truncated.

			<description>
		If I try to upload a photo from my photo gallery on an Android phone to an empty folder on the server, the ownCloud app wouldn't enter the folder when I click on it. Steps to reproduce: Create an empty folder on the ownCloud server Go to the Gallery app on an Android phone Select a photo and choose to share it via ownCloud Try to enter an empty folder to upload to it Result: you can't enter into an empty folder, hence you can't upload to it. This happens with ownCloud app v 1.3.17.

			<description>
		I believe the current version of the Android app 1.3.20 can not handle uploading files of any size using the owncloud app when running on Android 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. Tested on a fresh Android 4.2.2 code base on a Samsung Galaxy Nexus with factory images &quot;yakju&quot; for Galaxy Nexus &quot;maguro&quot; (GSM/HSPA+) from https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#yakjujdq39 Uploading files, and the instantupload of pictures fails at different percentages. Even small textfiles fail during the upload. Looking into tail /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log on the owncloud server I see: [Tue Feb 26 13:46:20 2013] [error] [client 192.168.0.1] PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 523800 bytes) in /var/www/html/owncloud/lib/db.php on line 562 adding more fysical RAM or changing the php max memory allocation sed -i 's/memory_limit = 500M/memory_limit = 768M/' /etc/php.ini does not seem to help. Our owncloud 4.5.6 or 4.5.7 used to work perfectly with the android client on phones with Android version 2.3.7 Looking for confirmation that somebody can successfully upload files and pictures with Jelly Bean, android 4.2.2 versions.

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		I set up my ownCloud at home, and immediately went to get the Android app. It took me about 30 minutes of picture taking to figure out the procedure for getting instant upload to work, and I wanted to suggest that the method by which I had to do it, was perhaps not as obvious as it should be. Here is how I did it: Create the InstantUpload folder via the web interface in the root &quot;/&quot; of my ownCloud account. Upload a picture to the InstantUpload folder via the web interface. Test a manual upload from my Note to the InstantUpload folder (if you hadn't completed steps 1 and 2, it would fail telling you that the first time you had to be online, which is unfortunately not as clear as it needs to be). Take a picture, and look at your notification shade to see it now uploading automatically. My suggestion is not to have the instructions come up as a toast notification, but as a true notification that sits in the notification shade. I had to take a few pictures in a row to be able to even read the whole message. At that, tapping the notification should bring you to a step by step instructional page outlining how to enable Instant Upload properly. Now, it is very possible that what I had to do was not the standard way people are getting instant upload to work, but it worked for me - so even if it sits here in the GitHub for someone else to find, so be it. Thank you for reading. Jay

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Expected behaviour Many camera's these days use exif metadata to define whether an image was taken in landscape or portrait mode, yet always store the image in landscape mode. To properly display such images, the exif data should be parsed for rotation information and this information should be used to apply the proper rotation to the image before displaying it. Actual behaviour I have found the the owncloud client on android ignores the exif rotation information. As a result, images are displayed in the wrong direction. Turning the android device to put the image upright triggers the auto-rotate function resulting in the image being rotated back to its wrong orientation. Environment data Android version: 4.1.1 Device model: Asus Transformer Prime TF201 Stock system, with all official updates applied ownCloud app version: 1.4.0 ownCloud server version: 4.5 Logs Skipped.

			<description>
		By tapping the OC icon in the notification pull-down you can trigger an exploit which allows you to browse all your OC content without entering a PIN. There are many ways to trigger this: during or after an upload, using InstantUpload or manual upload, etc. Obviously, a prerequisite is that you have activated the app PIN in your settings. Example: Take a photo in order to trigger InstantUpload. Wait for the OC icon to appear in the notification bar. Pull down the notification bar and tap the icon. This will display the photo that was just uploaded. Tap &quot;menu&quot; and then &quot;details&quot;. The file details are displayed. Tap the &quot;back&quot; button once. This will take you to the directory listing (in this case the &quot;InstantUpload&quot; folder). Tap &quot;back&quot; again and you are in your root directory, with full access to all directories, files and app settings. Step 5 should return to the photo. Step 6 should return to the home screen. Whenever directories are accessed, the user should be prompted for the app PIN, if one has been set. Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 running Android 2.3.6, app 1.4.1 and OC 5.0.7.

		Expected behaviour I recently installed owncloud on my server, and have successfully replicated 23 subdirectories (beneath the owncloud directory) from the Windows client. This is a total of around 5000 files. Replication works fine on those files to clients on other Windows machines. I have replicated this structure to the client on my Android phone (NTT docomo SC-02B - which is a Samsung Galaxy S), Apparently the replication proceeded perfectly. When I open the app, I expect to be able to use the app, scroll down through the folder list etc. Actual behaviour When I open the app, it starts correctly, and I can open and work with files in any directory that shows up on the first page of directory entries. However, immediately I scroll down through the directories and reach the 13th directory in the list, it consistently freezes the app, sometimes ending up with the &quot;wait/force close&quot; message, and sometimes ending up with the phone being completely locked and requiring a reboot. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, including using &quot;Clean Master&quot; to delete any old cache information, and the problem recurs Steps to reproduce See above Server configuration Operating system: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (12.04.2), with all updates updated Web server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) Database: MySQL 5.5.31-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 - (Ubuntu) PHP version: PHP Version 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.6 ownCloud version: 5.0.8 Client configuration Browser: Operating system: Gingerbread 2.6.35.7-1217619se,infra@SEP-40#2 kernel Logs Web server error log PHP Deprecated:  Comments starting with '#' are deprecated in /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/ming.ini on line 1 in Unknown on line 0

		Expected behaviour The Owncloud file client on Android and iPad doesn't show files, that were deleted on the server before. Actual behaviour The Owncloud file client on Android and iPad shows the last file, that was deleted on the server before. Trying to access that file from the Android/iPad client results in an error message, that either the file is broken or doesn't exist. It works after a while and I assume, because I closed and reopened the ownCloud site in my browser on the server. Steps to reproduce On the server delete some files in the browser. In the Android or iPad ownCloud client hit 'Refresh' Server configuration MAMP-Stack from week 29/2013.

			<description>
		I am using my own installation of OwnCloud 5.0.10, and the Android client 1.4.4. My WiFi network at work redirects all traffic to a login page. Once you've logged in it remembers your device (presumably by MAC address?) and stops redirecting traffic. If I attempt to browse my server using the Android client before I log in, no error is displayed. Instead, I'm presented with an empty / folder. If I exit the client, browse to a website, log in to WiFi, then return to the client, then I can see my files. I'd expect that if the client receives a nonsensical response (e.g. a WiFi login page) it'd display some sort of error message instead of just an empty file list.

		I' running the owncloud app version 1.4.4 on a 4.3 android phone. If i have enable ssl via the webinterface and download a file up to 97MB, the server gets busy up to 100%. The only thing what i can do, is reset the server, no input are possible. Smaler files are no problems if ssl is enabled. If it is disabled i can also download bigger files without problems. Owncloud server is 5.0.10 Is this a problem of the ssl certificate or is this a problem of android 4.3 or a problem of the owncloud app?

			<description>
		Hi, Installed the updated ownCloud-app and the automatic upload of images is broken. It worked fine with 1.4.4. I have both tried to reinstall the app and the workaround-app multiple times and also tried rebooting the phone. Had similar problem when I upgraded to 1.4.4, but that time the problem was the login.. Is there a way for me to extract some kind of logs from the app? Expected behaviour Automatic upload of pictures taken with the camera. Actual behaviour No upload of images. I have to manually select the images from my gallery app or from inside of the ownCloud-app.. Environment data Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note II (Nordic version) Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.4.5 ownCloud server version: 5.0.10

		As it was said in the title, if the system language is Chinese, whenever I tried to do &quot;Settings&quot;, the app crash, for 1.4.5 and 1.4.6. 1.4.4 didn't have this problem. If I switch the system language to English (so does the app language), it will not crash, even for 1.4.6 (1.4.5 not tested but should be the same). I'm using the version from f-droid.

		I have my own Owncloud server running over https. My Linux desktop client syncs fine. When I bring up the Owncloud app on my Android phone, I see my folders and files, but once I try to read a file it says the download failed. Then it brings me to the login page, where I log in with the same ID/password I'm using for the desktop client, but it says &quot;wrong username or password&quot; each time. This is over SSL. I get this in my SSL access logs when I attempt to log in: 10.1.10.111 - david [10/Nov/2013:23:14:15 -0500] &quot;HEAD /owncloud/remote.php/webdav/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 401 1328 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; (Note that I have CalDAV and CardDAV syncing working fine on my phone) My SSL error logs have: [Sun Nov 10 23:14:15 2013] [info] [client 10.1.10.111] Connection to child 8 established (server thekramers.net:443) [Sun Nov 10 23:14:20 2013] [info] client 10.1.10.111The timeout specified has expired: SSL input filter read failed. but I'm not sure that's an actual problem or not. In a few weeks I'm giving a talk about syncing data with an Android phone without involving Google, so I'm hoping to have it by then, as Owncloud is a big part of the presentation. Thanks.

		Currently the icon in the top bar is the same as the app icon: White/light with rounded corners. This looks very off in the top bar. Much like on iOS, the icon in the top bar should be the cloud in light/white, without anything around it, directly on the dark background of the top bar. cc @MTRichards @rperezb @davivel

		Expected behaviour Files added or removed from root folder should appear or disappear from Android client when the client is refreshed. Actual behaviour Files appear correctly after the first login. After that, files in the root folder do not change to match changes made on the server. If a file is added, removed or renamed it will remain the same in the Android client. Refresh, reboot and app relaunch don't help. Resetting the app data or reinstalling the app does cause the contents to refresh once (after logging in again). Folders work normally. Files inside folders work normally. The problem is only with files in the root folder. Steps to reproduce Install Android app Login and note files in root folder are correct Change a file (add, delete or rename) using the web interface or sync client. Refresh the Android app and note that files in the root folder do not change Environment data Android version: 4.3 and 4.2.2 Device model: Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 Stock or customized system: One custom, one stock ownCloud app version: 1.5.0 ownCloud server version: 4.5.13 running on CentOS 6 (installed from epel yum repository)

			<bugID>Issue #331</bugID>
			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Since I upgraded from OC 5 to 6.0 (RC2, RC4 and now the final version), every time I upload a file to a shared folder (==a folder someone has shared with me) Android app (v 1.5.1), the upload is done correctly (the file gets uploaded), but the rename seems to fail (files remain with their temporary name: .ocTransferIdXXX). The apps shows that an error happened in the upload. I don't know if the issue is client-side or server-side, it is happening on both Android and IOs clients (not while uploading through browser or windows desktop client). I've created an issue also on the IOs section (owncloud/ios-issues#146) I would appreciate it if someone could try to reproduce the issue so that we know if it's a general problem or something wrong with my setup. Steps: 1- User A shared a folder &quot;MyFolder&quot; to User B with all the permissions granted 2- User B, using the Android mobile app, tries to upload a file to MyFolder The upload fails on the client, but the file has been uploaded but not renamed from the temporary name (which includes the .ocTransferIdXXX suffix) Cheers Cheers

		Expected behaviour On same wifi as owncloud server, I expect uploads to happen fast without issue. If it does fail for whatever issue, I expect it to recognize it fast. Actual behaviour Doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes the upload fails or even stalls. I think the uploads also seem slow for being on the same wifi as the server, but I can't really say for sure. What do I mean by stall? While uploading a 25 megs file, the notification bar says it has been at 38% for atleast a confirmed 1 hour, with no sign of moving or registering as a fail. When I click the notification icon, it opens up the file view, but shows no progress bar at all. The file isn't visible on the server through normal web view. As best I can tell there is no way to cancel this upload either. The destination folder wasn't a shared folder, just a normal one. Steps to reproduce Upload multiple files (above 2 megs, sometimes around 20 megs). I was uploading through the share within ROM Toolbox trying to backup all my apps. But I have had this happen with share within Gallery too with multiple files. Rinse and repeat until it happens. It doesn't happen all the time, I was able to upload probably 300 megs until one file stalled.

He had suggested I open a new ticket and work with someone to improve the site performance and get it setup so that it is working at 100% so we can start the Android app testing.

Currently sorting goes like this: filename (2) filename (3) filename Which makes it pretty confusing since the original document is all the way on the bottom. Instead it should go like this: filename filename (2) filename (3) Even worse, when you have numbers in parentheses which exceed 10, it sorts like this: filename (18) filename (19) filename (2) filename (20) filename (21)

			<description>
		I was asked to file a bug report on the forum. It seems the test as you type the server address causes an issue if you have an invalid SSL cert which many of us will have running home based servers. While typing in the server address the client tests it and and invalid SSL Cert dialog pops up but then the next character I had already started typing brings focus back to the client so the SSL Cert Dialog is moved to the background and the connection can't be completed because its waiting on the dialog to be closed.

		I have an HTC One V that I would really like to replace Dropbox's Camera Upload with something I am in control of. I got this to work perfectly with a Samsung Galaxy S3. Now I need to add an HTC One V to the same setup. I install the app, turn on uploading of pictures, take a picture, and nothing happens. I have looked through the owncloud forums and this issue tracker and it appears that this bug was resolved? Please let me know if I can provide more information. This is with the android app v1.5.4 and server 6.01

		The update today (or yesterday, the one with sharing) made the ownCloud app icon vanish from the homescreen. As far as I remember this is not the first time this happens, and it sometimes happens with other apps too. I searched around a bit and it might be a problem the apps themselves need to handle: http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1s3fn3/anybody_else_notice_every_time_apps_update_in/ If an app changes the name/class of the default activity, the icon is removed. This is what causes some of it. Any idea @davivel?

			<description>
		My owncloud server is running in https only on a nginx server and I use server certificates from cacert, cacert root certificates are not included on my android device (and probably in any android). When I installed the owncloud app it was able to connect without problems to the server but I was only able to browse and read the files, any attempt to upload did stalled forever, in the server log I found lots of lines like those: x.x.x.x - username [04/Apr/2014:20:49:54 +0200] &quot;HEAD /remote.php/webdav/documents/0523acaa096b5e583292145dc8bb77be%20(7).jpg HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; x.x.x.x - username [04/Apr/2014:20:49:55 +0200] &quot;HEAD /remote.php/webdav/documents/0523acaa096b5e583292145dc8bb77be%20(8).jpg HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; x.x.x.x - username [04/Apr/2014:20:49:55 +0200] &quot;HEAD /remote.php/webdav/documents/0523acaa096b5e583292145dc8bb77be%20(9).jpg HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Android-ownCloud&quot; but nothing was uploaded. Today I installed CACert's root certificates on my android device and viola, everything works perfectly. I just wanted to let you know since I was not able to find a solution online, maybe others have a similar problem with a server using certificates not issued by a CA trusted by Android.

		for English, pleas scroll down! Und zwar fiel mir heute auf, das mein Handy (Galaxy S3 / CyanogenMod / Android 4.3.1) schon mindestens seit Wochen keine Textdateien zum Server synct. Nur lokal liegt immer die akuellste Version richtig vor. Aktualisiere ich einen Dateiinhalt am Telefon erscheint zwar die Meldung, dass die Datei erfolgreich hoch geladen wurde und auf dem Server wird das Datum des Elternverzeichnisses aktualisiert. Aber beim öffnen über den Browser der wird weiterhin der veraltete Textinhalt angezeigt. Ich hab mit allen Mitteln versucht den Sync zu erzwingen. Manuell in der App das Verz und das ganze Konto, ab-/anmelden auf beiden Geräten usw.. Leider ohne erkennbaren Erfolg. The app does not sync completely textfiles with the server. If in the in the app the content of an file will be updated, the notice &quot;file uploaded successfully&quot; occurs and the date of the directory on the server gets the correct new update-time. But the content of the file will not be updated. I tried everything i know to force the sync. Manually in the app the folder and the whole account and to log-in/-out on the device and the browser. But nothing changes. greetz, Rob

		Hello, I recently downloaded the Android App and I received an error message right after entering the Server URL. The message was &quot;Cannot authenticate against this server&quot;. There was an update a couple days ago, which just translated the error message into German. For info: the iOS App is running well with the same server. So I really imagine the problem is on client side. Also web login and desktop clients work fine as well. I hope it is ok to post this (blocking) issue here, as it looks like the Xing Group is not the right place to post. Best regards, Matthias

		I just send a crash report through google play (as @MTRichards suggested). This is how the notification area looks like. I can repeatedly click the notification and it always crashes again. The notification stays there. EDIT: I want to upload a screenshot. I was in gallery and shared with ownCloud APP. Then upload to the instant upload folder and it starts uploading. after a while it stops uplpading and clicking the notification the APP opens and just crashes. I will open a github issue with a Screenshot of the notification

			<bugID>Issue #529</bugID>
			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Traveled abroad yesterday and noticed something strange with the automatic upload of pictures. My default setting is to only upload when connected to Wi-Fi. All was well until I connected my phone to the airport network that requires me too start the browser and accept the TOS. Only after that do I get a connection to the Internet. What happened was that before I had a chance to accept the TOS, ownCloud started to try and upload 400 images (3-400MB in total) that I took during my visit. And of course the upload failed. But after accepting the TOS, the upload worked. And then it was time for me to board my flight and I switched off Wi-Fi and expected the upload to stop, but no, instead the upload jumped over to the cellular network and started to eat away my precious 20 MB/day quota when I’m abroad. Managed to switch off the cellular network and the uploads started to fail, after killing the app in the Android settings did the madness stop. Android did notify me when I connected to the airport Wi-Fi that I needed to sign in/accept the TOS. Is it possible to get the ownCloud app to halt the upload until there actually is a working connection to the Internet and not just a connection to a local Wi-Fi/AP network? It should try to “ping” the server and see if it gets a valid response back before starting the automatic upload. Expected behaviour Upload should have stopped when the Wi-Fi connection was turned off. Actual behaviour When Wi-Fi was turned off, the ownCloud resumed the automatic upload over the cellular network instead of just stop the upload and wait for a Wi-Fi connection. Environment data for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note II Stock or customized system: Stock ownCloud app version: 1.5.7 Server runs 6.0.3

		I have a problem with one photo which always gets &quot;Upload failed&quot;. It retries continuously. But, looking at the server, the file is there, and many other duplicates. Let's call the file PANO_123.JPG. On the server, I have multiple copies of the file: PANO_123.JPG PANO_123(1).JPG PANO_123(2).JPG and so on... So, the upload is indeed successful, but for some reason the client marks it as failed and it retries later. I have to clean the InstantUpload folder on my owncloud to prevent taking too much disk space.

			<description>
		Hi. Thank you for a wonderful app. What I would like added if possible, is the ability to change font size in file lists. The reason is simple: long filenames get truncated and thus makes it harder to know which file is which, especially in similarly named files. Adding a &quot;change font size&quot; setting would allow viewing full names without eclipses. A workaround would be to allow long names spanning multiple rows.

		I believe there is bug in application somewhere - while large file being uploaded (let's say 90MB) there are random glitches.

Steps to reproduce Launch Google Photos app Select an image, press the share icon and select Owncloud press upload nothing happens, no errors, no network activity, no activity in apache logs. Recent apps show owncloud, and when pressed &quot;The application could not be started&quot; message appears and owncloud closes Repeat with Sony Album app or File Commander and uploading works every time.

		Just experienced an issue with the app when an instant upload of an image (and possibly a video too) is being uploaded with Antivirus enabled on the server end of Owncloud. It appears that the upload is successful and the file is indeed uploaded, but since ClamAv (Clamscan) is scanning the file which might take a while on slow systems, the android app says it has failed. This is probably a timeout issue in my opinion.

		We replaced the globe (aka shuriken) with a more understandable »link« icon. Please update the mobile apps (Android as well as iOS) with that: PNG: https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/core/img/actions/public.png SVG: https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/core/img/actions/public.svg cc @rperezb @MTRichards Except in the navigation bar on iOS – please keep the normal »Share icon« for that instead of using the link (as discussed before).

		I'm using an OwnCloud 7.07 server over https. The android app will not allow me to log in. I enter the server details and it shows me 'Connection Established'. After entering credentials and touching 'Connect', the login screen does disappear momentarily. I see the top bar with the 'upload' icon and a loading icon, but no files. Shortly after, I am sent right back to the login screen without any error message. I am using an HTC One M8 with Android KitKat (4.4.2). My owncloud server is running on a non-standard port, but I use DNS to forward it properly. As the 'Connection established' message is shown, I assume this is not part of the issue. Nothing is logged at all on the owncloud server in the owncloud.log or the httpd access_log or error_log.

After removing the trailing slash the error message went away. The Android App should strip the trailing slash so that the user does not get confused by this kind of error.

		I am running the android app version 1.5.8. I am running an SSL-enabled owncloud server supported by a CA, that is not in the trusted CA list of my android device, so I had to manually accept the certificate in my owncloud client. I recently updated the certificate on my server to a new certificate by the same CA. I noticed that the file listing on my android client wasn't updated anymore. When trying to manually update the list, I get a busy icon for less than a second, but my file list doesn't update. No warning message was shown in the user interface. After I set the password for this account again (which wasn't changed), I got a certificate warning message again. After having accepted the new certificate here, I could again use my owncloud account. I assume that if the server certificate doesn't match, the connection is silently dropped and no warning is shown to the user. I suggest to show the certificate warning dialog here again instead of silently dropping the connection. @eriktews I (@rperezb) edit your issue to have a better tracking of the scope and expectations: STEPS: Having a ssl self signed cert installed on the ownCloud server Install the Android app and log in accepting the cert From the server side, change the cert Do any action on the Android app such as refresh CURRENT STATUS: The app stop working, every request to the server fails EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR: When this change is detected, we will show a similar popup to the one shown when you accept the cert for the first time This is detected when the current folder is refreshed, similar behavior to the case when the credentials have changed if any upload fails due to the change of the certificate the error shown will be: connection error NOTE: It has been reported on #1420 #1463 and #1515

		I just changed the password of my ownCloud account. After that, on my android device, I tried changing the password for the ownCloud account. That seemed to be easy enough, and my new password was accepted without problems. After that, however, the ownCloud android client was constantly complaining about a &quot;failed synchronisation&quot; for the instant upload images. Also when navigating inside the owncloud app, even though some folder content was shown, it seemed to be outdated, as of most folders the subfolders (especially those I had never loaded before) were empty, and the spinner on the top never stopped turning (even for the folders where some content was shown). Is there any log to check for the case when such problems happen? I tried setting the password multiple times, I'm sure it was the correct one, it never worked I then tried removing the account and recreating it, which also didn't change anything. Next I tried &quot;force stopping&quot; the app and removing all its data, which also didn't help. At last, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the client (and the JellyBean workaround app, which still seems to be required on 4.4, correct?), and after recreating the account then, it finally worked again. Anybody else seen this? Any log or so I can check for details as to why the simple password change procedure didn't work in my case? Note: I didn't specifically check the version before reinstalling, but since automatic upgrades are enabled, I suppose it was the version 1.5.8 of the app before and after re-installation. I'm currently trying a second password change to see if this behavior is reproducible in my environment. Edit: Not reproducible at the moment. So I'm closing this issue. Maybe it will be a guidance for others having a similar experience...

			<description>
		I am using the android client (v.1.5.8 from f-droid) on a Samsung Note 8 (android v. 4.2.2) and I am trying to keep some pdf files in sync. Since I tick on the &quot;Keep file up to date&quot; option for every file, I expect files to automatically syncronize to the server after I add annotations or highlights, i.e. files should be uploaded soon after they are modified. However, this does not happen, not even if I force a sync tapping on &quot;Refresh account&quot;. When I check the modification time of the pdfs using a file browser, I can see the modification time is older than the one shown in the client. The only workaround I found is (1) to manually force a sync by long tapping the file and then choosing &quot;Refresh file&quot; or (2) to force the sync of another file in the same folder as in (1), then the other files are uploaded after I modified them (this seems to work consistently, at least as far as I could test) I don't have similar problems with other types of files, for instance text files are uploaded immediately after modification. Also there is nothing suspicious in owncloud.log on the server.

		I'm new to Owncloud, I looked for thi bug in the issues but didn't find it. Hope not to generate a duplicate. When I try to upload to Owncloud a file from a different app (like Ghost commander or Download), it doesn't work, no error is generated. The correct sequence is this: I select the file in the other app I tap the share button I choose to share to owncloud app A pop up tree of the ownclud directory appears, I choose the directory where I want to upload the file I tap on the &quot;upload button&quot; nothing happens. If I look in the owncloud web app, the log doesn't show anything, so I suppose is something happening in android, not regarding the server. On the other side, uploading a file directly through the owncloud app, works.

		I just bought the Android ownCloud app (v1.6.2) for my HTC Desire 200 (Android version 4.1.2) and I have an issue. I can seemingly login, meaning that I don't get an error message on my phone. But no files show up and when I try to upload something, I get the error &quot;Upload failed, you need to relogin&quot;. Then I get to login screen, where logging in doesn't help. I just see the empty file list again. The log file of ownCloud (v7.0.3+dfsg-1 on Debian Jessie) shows errors: {&quot;app&quot;:&quot;core&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Login failed: 'adrian' (Remote IP: '192.168.2.149', X-Forwarded-For: '')&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2014-12-09T11:37:40+00:00&quot;}
 This line appears multiple times. Sometimes four times, sometimes eight times.

			<description>
		Hello good owncloud peoples! While I was testing the Android app for writing up the manual page, I encountered this issue: the user menu only appears in landscape mode on my tablet. This is what I see in portrait mode: No matter how I I swipe or poke the user menu does not drop down in portrait mode. However, in landscape mode it appears automatically: This behaves the same way in the Dolphin and Firefox Web browsers. I don't know if it does this on other Android devices because I only have one. ASUS Memopad 8, K00L Android version 4.2.2 kernel version 3.0.36

			<description>
		Running on a Samsung Galaxy Express (GT-I8730) running Android 4.4.4, with v1.6.2 of OwnCloud app, and connecting to latest version of Owncloud 7, with encryption plugin active. I find that if I set the instant upload directory to an ordinary (ie local) directory then it works ok, but on an external share, it continually tells me the upload has failed, then tries again later. In fact, the upload is not failing - I end up with multiple copies of the image in the selected directory with an incrementing number in brackets after the file name. (The files all seem to be the same size, and to open correctly, so I am assuming that they do in fact contain all data.) The external directory is an Amazon S3 bucket. It may be relevant that rather than using Owncloud's external share setup, I have the bucket mounted as part of the local filesystem using the s3 fuse driver (I was not able to get the S3 external storage working through Owncloud's interface).

		I used the Android app to rename a directory from &quot;Photo's&quot; to &quot;Afbeeldingen&quot;. After I did this all subdirectories and images in that directory were gone. At least they are no longer visible in the android app. They are still present in the webinterface and the native client on linux also has no issues seeing the images. This was a scary moment ! I managed to force the android app to rescan the renamed directory by adding another image to it via the owncloud directory on my linux box. When the android app got notified of this new image it also rediscovered my other images and subdirectories. Android app version 1.6.2 Owncloud server installation: 7.0.2 on Centos 6

		It would appear that when using ownCloud Android client version 1.7.1 when trying to download files that were uploaded with the web interface I get a &quot;Download failed&quot; every time. However, if I use the URL in a mobile browser and log in and download, it works fine. I have no errors in the log files on the server. This leads me to believe it is an application problem. I would love to provide more information, if someone can give me an idea of what to provide.

		Hi, I find the MOVE operation does not work well on my phone. When I move one file in one folder to another,it will delete the file in source folder and the file shows up in one sec in destination folder,then it disappears.Also,I cannot find the file at my account in website. My owncloud android version is 1.7.1 and owncloud server version is 8.0.2. I use Openstack Swift as back end storage. Looking forward to your solution! Thanks!

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		I noticed a couple of days ago that my phone started to drain the battery very fast and using a program to trace which programs are using wakelocks, I found that the owncloud syncing was responsible, making my phone never entering in deep sleep. I had to disable syncing, otherwise my battery lasts close to nothing. Not too long ago I added some external folders to my owncloud server with a lot of files (~67K files). I wonder if that could trigger this problem (but I think I noticed this problem in my phone a few days after I added the files to the server). A simple way to see if these 2 events are related would be to exclude the new external folders from the syncing, but I can't find any option to select which folder to sync, as you can do with the (linux) desktop app.

		Hi, first of all: I already wrote an email to the developers, but for tracing, I'm opening this issue. What I have: OwnCloud 8.0.3 on Linux Android app v1.7.1 Android 5.0.2 Nexus 6 Owncloud settings (sharing, number of checkbox order in braces): allow share api (1) allow to share links (2) NOT force password (3) NOT allow public upload (4) allow users to send email notifications (5) set default date (6): 1 day -&gt; do NOT force date allow re-sharing (7) do NOT restrict to groups (8) allow users to send email notifications (9) do NOT restrict to groups (10) What I did (app): choose account: one user, one admin browse to a folder or file select &quot;share link&quot; select app to share (tried with email and others) What then happens: sometimes message appears &quot;you have no permissions to share this file&quot; sometimes a password input dialog appears if the dialog appears: Can't leave the pw blank -&gt; fails (you have to enter a password) if I select &quot;cancel&quot; -&gt; nothing happens if I enter a password -&gt; you do not have permissions to share this file What I expected: because of the settings at oc I awaited the email app to be opened to share the link: with and/or without password If I can provide you further informations, please let me know. Also it would be possible to provide you a &quot;test&quot; user account at this server instance. Please notice: My app and server is located to germany, so there's a great chance the given messages I provided does not match 1:1 to the orginal messages. I simply tried to translate by myself. Thanks!

			<description>
		Sometimes, ownCloud 1.7.1 hangs when doing an upload. I have no way of cancel the upload. I need to stop the app via the App manager in order to make it working again. In my case, those hanging uploads sit there forever (I had an upload hanging for 8 hours). It would be good if there was an option to cancel an upload (i.e. tap on the upload notification then see all pending uploads, and a way to cancel the upload).

		With the new (material design) implementation buttons can't simply bind java methods via configuration anymore but need to do this is the way we already did it except for one instance in the login screen, when you hit the refresh button (for example when you entered an invalid owncloud url). Bug number 2 (I know this should be separated..) is a UI glitch, or rather two on the login screen: the refresh button is oversized in the landscape mode the hint text has a size glitch when you refresh on an invalid address (spinning icon Vs. warning icon) Unfortunately I don't have the time now to fork/PR but I have the fix already on the other branches for #1090 and #1100 e.g. 044c597 549284e d78077d hopefully I will find the time to open up a PR tomorrow.

		Owncloud's upload will sometimes freeze in the middle of an &quot;Instant upload&quot; if I'm on the edge of my wifi or leaving the house. Then the notification that the upload is 55% (or whatever) just stays there as it is still uploading and it is non-dismissable. It would be nice if this uploading notification was dismissable. If owncloud has not actually sent any data for a minute it should queue it for later.

READ_PHONE_STATE allows to access a lot of information about the phone, including the IMEI of the phone and details about the SIM card. Is this really necessary? Was it added by accident? I do not find any usage of TelephonyManager which would require the permission.

		Before OC8.2, I had several external storages (SFTP) mounted on a per-OC-user base, so every user had to enter login and password to use the external storage. As I use LDAP, all user's logins are the same, so this was quite a bit of double work. Now I switched to OC 8.2's new method to use session credentials. I globally added the external storage with this option, so OC logs in every user with his or her OC credentials to the SSH server. This works fine in the web interface and with normal WebDAV-access. The android app, however, does not even display the external storage mounted with &quot;use session credentials&quot;.

		Hi, The android client for owncloud is throwing the following error when trying to connect over HTTPS: &quot;Unknown error ocurred!&quot; after testing the connection. I just updated recently to core version 8.2.1 and suddenly the mobile connectivity stopped working. I am using nginx + php5-fpm (5.6.16-2+deb.sury.org~trusty+1 (fpm-fcgi)) in ubuntu 14.04 and the nginx config is directly the config you provide in the official documentation. I put here a capture of nginx logs when the mobile app tries to connect: [08/Dec/2015:19:12:54 +0000] &quot;GET /status.php HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 106 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Android) ownCloud-android/1.9.0&quot; &quot;-&quot; It seems like the webserver responds properly but the mobile app fails to connect. I am trying to connecto from a Nexus 5 with Android 6.0, but this is also reproducible in other mobile phones and in Android 5.x This is getting very annoying and I would be very please if you could take a look. Thanks in advance.

		Since 1.9.0 the Android OC client is constantly syncing and keeping the device awake when the auto-sync option under &quot;Accounts&quot; is checked. I've got it installed on two 5.1.1 devices and this behaviour occurs on both. Once it has finished scanning the whole folder structure it starts again after 30-60 seconds, keeping the device awake (it never goes do deep-sleep), draining the battery and generating permanent traffic. This didn't occur with 1.8.0. Because of that I had to disable auto sync. Does anyone have this problem as well?

		My OC server uses a CAcert.org certificate (which had to be manually &quot;trusted&quot; after checking the fingerprint when the oc client was setup initially). I recently updated the certificate, because it was close to expire. When upstarting the OC Android client, or when clicking &quot;Konto aktualisieren&quot; (account sync), no warning information was shown (that the certificate has changed). But when actually performing a file action like &quot;delete file on the server&quot; (I only tried &quot;delete&quot; actions), the client shows the certificate-untrusted warning, so that I then could manually check the new fingerprint and set permanent trust to the renewed connection's certificate. I regard the following as a bug: certificate is not tested during syncing (certificate-has-changed information is not shown during syncing; it is however tested when actually performing a file action like delete.

		At the moment I'm using owncloud android app 1.9.1 (via Stackstorage) but I'm missing out on a feature. All folders I created and files I uploaded in the web/windows client are only visible when I manually refresh the directory (pull-down refresh) in app. For example, I create a directory structure like this in-browser: Root = Folder 1 == Folder 2 === Folder 3 When I open my storage in the android app, I land up in root and there is no folder visible and the message &quot;Nothing in here. Upload something!&quot; is showing. I have to manually refresh the directory and then Folder 1 becomes visible. When I open Folder 1, it is empty again and I have to manually refresh to see Folder 2. The same for Folder 3. A nice feature would be that the file/dir listing is automatically refreshed so I don't need to manually refresh the x.xxx folders I have in my storage. Not sure if it's a bug or a feature request, but I hope you guys can help out!

		Actual behaviour Configuration OwnCloud is configured with a base path /owncloud using docker image mwaeckerlin/owncloud: docker run -d --name owncloud-mysql-volume mysql sleep infinity
docker run -d --name owncloud-volume mwaeckerlin/owncloud sleep infinity
docker run -d --name owncloud-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somePassWord -e MYSQL_DATABASE=owncloud -e MYSQL_USER=owncloud -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=someOtherPassWord --volumes-from owncloud-mysql-volume owncloud-mysql-volume
docker run -d --name owncloud -e BASEPATH=/owncloud -e WEBROOT=/owncloud -e URL=some.url -e UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE=16G -e MAX_INPUT_TIME=7200 --volumes-from owncloud-volume --link owncloud-mysql:mysql
 In front of OwnCloud, there is a Nginx reverse proxy, that does SSL (with a valid certificate), and redirects http to https, using docker image mwaeckerlin/reverse-proxy, the relevant part here is: docker run -d --name reverse-proxy -p 443:443 -p 80:80 --link owncloud:some.url%2fowncloud [...] mwaeckerlin/reverse-proxy
 I configures instant upload, also from mobile. What Happens Some files succeed, some files fail. I don't see any major difference between those files. Sometimes files do upload after some numbers of retrials, some did not (yet), even so I retried many many times. Upload bar goes to 100%, then fails. Uploads may fail regardless whether they are triggered by the instant upload or manually by using «share» with the OwnCloud app. Expected behaviour All files always succeed. Steps to reproduce Try to share some files, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) Since it is an occasional behaviour, I can't really test that. Environment data Android version: 5.1, 6.0.1,.5.1.1 Device model: Sony XPeria Z3 Compact, Xperia M5, Xperia Z2 tablet Stock or customized system: - ownCloud app version: 2.0.1 ownCloud server version: 9.0.3 Logs Web server error log Funny, upload just succeeded, when I wanted to get the logs for the failure. This after about 10-20 fails for the same file. So here you see all the logs for the file where I replaced the original file name by filename and the external IP by 66.66.66.66. The first attempts were fails, the last attempt was successful: On Nginx: 66.66.66.66 - mwaeckerlin [08/Jul/2016:08:44:01 +0000] &quot;HEAD /owncloud/remote.php/webdav/clientsync/navigation/filename..gpx HTTP/1.1&quot; 301 0 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Android) ownCloud-android/1.9.0&quot;

 ownCloud log (data/owncloud.log) Nothing special, at least the file name does not appear. Unfortunately, there is a lot of traffic, several desktop clients and Android DAV clients do their synchronisation tasks at the same time. So I need to filter the relevant parts and cannot just paste everything here.

		A video is recorded or photo is taken and instant upload kicks in. The phone is put into sleep mode and next time it is woken up OwnCloud displays an error message. Upload failed 'app was terminated'. Presumably Android is terminating the service when the phone goes into sleep mode. I understand that the desktop client breaks files down into chunks for uploading. Could the Android client not implement the same behaviour? Then the service could be created as START_STICKY and resume uploading from the previous chunk when it gets restarted. This would also help when switching between wifi hotspots or moving from wifi to cellular data. The issue is occurring on a Samsung Galaxy J7 with Android Marshmallow

		Steps to reproduce Enable instant uploads and set the camera folder with default google camera Take some photos/videos Actual behaviour Anything is uploaded Expected behaviour All the content is uploaded Environment data Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Model number SM-N910F Security Patch Level: 1 July 2016 Kernel version: 3.10.40-7733605 Camera app: default Samsung camera, version 3.0 ownCloud server version: 9.1 Checked in other Android versions, Samsung devices, camera apps and the problem does not happen. It seems to be a problem related with the storage location from camera and photo/video taken Notice this device doesn't have slot for SD Card; due to that, the app stores always files in main storage, and the option in the app to select storage volume is disabled.

		Actual behaviour When using a site with an untrusted SSL certificate, I get a &quot;the identity of the site could not be verified&quot; pop up as expected. However, when I try to click the &quot;Yes&quot; button to dismiss the popup (or even &quot;No&quot;), the app doesn't dismiss the popup. Expected behaviour The app should dismiss the popup when I press either &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Yes&quot;. Steps to reproduce Open up owncloud app Type an server address with a self-signed certificate Can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server? (url: https://demo.owncloud.org, user: test, password: test) Nope Environment data Android version: 5.1 Device model: Motorola Moto X Stock or customized system: Nope ownCloud app version: 2.1.2 ownCloud server version: ownCloud 7.0.4+dfsg-4~deb8u4 (Debian) (stable)

		Steps In app, login in an account In server, delete the account In app, select the account in drawer or in account manager Redirection to login view The account does not exist anymore, so credentials will never work (username is non-editable). If you tap on &quot;Go Back&quot; button, the files view or settings view (depending whether the app has more accounts or not) is shown for a little while, but you are redirected again to login view. It is a bit annoying to switch to another account or tap on &quot;new account&quot;. Expected behaviour? Switch to another account, or to login view if the app has no accounts. The question is if server side answers in the same way if the credentials have changed and if the account is removed to detect these two different cases.

		Changes in the device orientation can lead to an indefinite spinner in the share dialog. It's hard to isolate the specific condition that is triggering this, but it's happening often. Steps to reproduce: Select a file and choose to share it. Change the device orientation. Repeat and retry this 2 steps until the load spinner stays stuck. After this happening once, it's reproduced systematically. Current behavior The Loading... spinner stays in focus forever. If you try to click the back button, the app doesn't respond, and a couple of minutes after closing it, crashes. Expected behavior Spinner should be displayed while getting the share settings for that file and a timeout should be triggered if these settings cannot be pulled from the server. Test environment Android 6.0.1 on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4

		Steps Connect to Wifi Setup the Wifi to auto-disconnect on lock (when the screen locks itself, it will disconnect from Wifi completely and never reconnect until unlocked) Unlock the screen Go to Google's picture app Select many pictures Share and select the ownCloud app Select a destination folder and start the upload Let the phone aside and see the cloud icon in the notification bar, it's uploading Wait for phone to auto-lock, wait longer, go have coffee Come back to phone, unlock it Check notification area Expected result Notification area must display a permanent message &quot;Upload failed due connection problems&quot; or something similar because Android disconnected the Wifi when the phone automatically locked itself. Actual result No notification at all from the ownCloud app. Two times I thought it successfully finished uploading and when I checked my pics folder from the laptop there were missing pictures. Versions ownCloud server 9.1.3 ownCloud Android app 2.2.0 Android Nexus 4 mobile phone with Android 5.1.1 @davivel even holidays have their bug reports 😉
