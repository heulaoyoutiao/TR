scroll it up, and it appears to have problems moving out of symlinked

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 8 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. I installed Ankidroid
2. Then I downloaded &quot;Japanese Kana.anki&quot; and &quot;All Kanji for JLPT 1.anki&quot; 
using the desktop Anki.
3. I was not sure where to find those downloaded .anki files then, but I 
found them in C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\.anki\backups
4. I copied them to SD card to directory ../anki/ and changed names, 
because in backups directory they were named like &quot;E!username!Japanese 
Kana.backup-1.anki&quot;
5. After that I started Ankidroid - it could find and open those .anki 
files with no errors.

What is the expected output?

As I understand it should show something.

What do you see instead?

Just white screen with Show answer/Next button, timer and Whiteboard Off/
On button. I can press Show answer/Next button - nothing changes (although 
it might switch something internally, but nothing is shown). Whiteboard 
works OK - I can enable it and write something on the whitescreen.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

Ankidroid 0.1 installed from Android Market. Phone is standard HT-03A from 
NTT, firmware 1.5, kernel 2.6.27-00393-g6607056, build CDB72.

Please provide any additional information below.

I didn't actually try anything yet, I suspect that maybe I copied 
wrong .anki files (maybe backup ones are different somehow) - but there is 
no information about how to do it:

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 18 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start Ankidroid on your phone and let it load up a new card.
2. Tip your phone over to have it change orientation.
3. The &quot;Loading deck. Please wait...&quot; dialog appears and there is a long delay until
the new 
card appears.

Since Android restarts the activity on a configuration change like this, it will also
trigger a 
reopen of the database and a reload of the card to show. This is unnecessarily slow
in my 
opinion. Saving the card and just reload the layout should be enough.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 21 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Launch the application (either in a device or the emulator) without an
sd card attached to it

If you follow this step, the application will crash. I am not sure which
has to be the expected behaviour (Can we save decks on the device, not in
the sd card?) but one solution would be show a friendly user to the user
informing that the sd card is not attached.

What do you think, guys?

			<summary>Deck Picker crashes when exists a file ending with .anki that it's not a real anki file</summary>

			<bugID>Issue #927</bugID>
			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 24 I noticed this bug when I was trying to test if Deck Picker would be able
to handle a huge number of decks, so I copied all decks on my Anki decks
folder on my computer to my phone. 

Then, the Deck Picker crashed every time, but investigating a little I
discovered it was due a file named &quot;._AC.anki&quot; not because there were so
many decks. I supposed this deck it's a kind of temporary file Anki Desktop
made for one of my real decks.

For the user it could be kind of disturbing and annoying if he cannot open
the Deck Picker because of some hidden file he copied even without being
aware of it. The solution would be try to open all the files ending with
.anki but only show the ones that are real anki files (that is to say,
handling the SQLExceptions correctly).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 26 If you try to load a deck without any card in Ankidroid the app is going to
crash. 

This Exception can be handled easily in order to avoid the crash, but then
I'm not sure what would be the most desirable behaviour: Should we show an
empty card? Should we show in addition a dialog to let know to the user
what happened?

If somebody has some idea, it would be great hear what you think about it
before I start implementing a solution.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 27 I'm using my decks generated by Anki Desktop and the WebView used in
Ankidroid does not display correctly formatted all text (for example, the
bold letter).

I want to investigate why this happens, maybe not all HTML tags are
supported in Android. In that case, maybe the text in the card has to be
parsed and change the tags that don't work for others that do.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 32 Is it possible to load cards from the deck in their original order instead of in random
on the 
first time it is opened? If the deck has 2000 odd entries, it is useless to start on
the 500th 
card when you may not be up to there yet. Need an option to load cards in order or
shuffle. 
Untilled that is there I can't use ankidroid. I have had it on my phone for some time
and it is 
useless as is to study kanji. Is this built on the assumption that the entire deck
has been 
previously studied? What happens whenever the information being studied is new? 
Especially with kanji,  it needs to go in order at first view, ads should start after
the card has 
been learnt, then it becomes a review. Perhaps a learn mode and a review mode would
be 
a good way. If this feature is there the apparently would be 1000x more useable, because
its 
useless to me to srs cards which are ahead of my level and yet to be studied.

What could we do about that? I think it's impossible to really finish the
commit so the options that I thought are:

- Show to the user a message informing him that the data could not be saved :(
- Use some structure or database like a backup and commit to the real deck
when the connection with the database is available again

Do you have any other idea?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 54 Here is the deck I have used for weeks with the SRS algorithm

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4390779/japanese.anki

I know there is about 1300 cards that have to be reviewed, but still 
AnkiDroid shows &quot;Unable to find a card&quot; after 10 or 20 reviews, everyday.

Have you ever seen this problem ?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 55 I have the HTC Tattoo, and Ankidroid cannot be found on the market. I
suspect it is because Tattoo has a QVGA resolution (320*240). Apps using
API 3 must declare support for QVGA, or will not appear in the Market for
these devices.

Proposed changes:
1. Use API level 4 or greater
OR
2. declare
 [supports-screens 
     android:largeScreens=&quot;true&quot; 
     android:normalScreens=&quot;true&quot; 
     android:smallScreens=&quot;true&quot; 
     android:anyDensity=&quot;false&quot;/]

Expression: 寒いわけだ。まどが開いています
Meaning: ah that's why it's cold: the window is open
Reading: 寒[さむ]いわけだ。まどが 開[ひら]いています

When the answer is displayed, the English text is messed up, like if spaces 
between words had been removed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 59 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Load a deck and finish reviewing old and new cards; in 0.4alpha, the
&quot;Unable to find a card!&quot; screen
2. Restart the application, possibly by rebooting the phone or termination
(or crash) or Ankidroid
3. Try to load the original deck. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see &quot;Unable to find a card!&quot;, but instead it shows that &quot;No
deck loaded. Please, press menu and select one of the decks stored in your
sd card.&quot; This might lead the user to believe Ankidroid failed to load the
deck, but in reality just didn't find a card to display.

When we fix the &quot;Unable to find a card!&quot; prompt to an appropriate message,
we should display that.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
0.4alpha on HTC Tattoo, Android 1.6

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 65 I really wanted to crash AnkiDroid so I did the following:
- open deck picker
- delete one of the decks using astro
- long press home key to come back to anki
- open the deleted deck

No user would probably ever do that, so it is very low priority.
As I could expect, AnkiDroid crashed:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 67 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck.
2. Click &quot;Answer&quot;.
3. Click &quot;Easy&quot; like crazy, as many times as you can.

What is the expected output?
Next card is shown after a few seconds.

What do you see instead?
AnkiDroid shows a spinning &quot;Loading new card...&quot; forever (or at least a 
long time, still spinning after 2 minutes)

The solution is probably to not take extra clicks into account, by having 
a &quot;clicked&quot; flag that is reset every time a new display is shown. Should 
ideally prevent one from clicking &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Good&quot; quickly after.

It seems unreasonable to click that much, but we can expect some users to 
do this, and yesterday it actually happened to me by mistake, I did not 
realized my finger was close to the screen and clicking repeatedly.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 68 It fails to load the decks and display the cards. The way it fails depends on whether
the capitals deck is 
present or not in the sdcard.

- With the capitals deck not present
It doesn't create the capitals deck on the sd.

If there aren't any decks in the root of the sdcard it shows an empty list and gives
a force close [fc] when 
pressing back button. Therefore there is no option to select another folder since the
menu is in the previous 
activity.

If there are decks other than the capitals it displays them with a 'loading' status
which goes forever. 
Selecting any of the decks gives a fc.

- With the capitals deck
Displays a message Failed to load deck. Allows to change to another deck and configure
the decks path but still 
fails to load any of them.

I'm using Ankidroid 0.4 beta1 running on a Nexus one with Android 2.1 (actually CM5.0.4.1
but also tested with 
stock rom with same result).

-------------------------------------------
I haven't created a set of issues for each one of the bugs since I thing (hope) they
are all related.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 69 I noticed something strange on two of my decks:

If &quot;new cards spacing&quot; = &quot;after reviews&quot;, then after reviews the 
&quot;Congratulations&quot; message appears. Even though limits are far from 
reached and there are thousands of new cards waiting.

If I switch &quot;new cards spacing&quot; to &quot;after reviews&quot; then the new cards 
appear.

Yesterday I tested this for 20 minutes, switching the setting back and 
forth, and the issue was always happening.

Nothing special appears in the log.

Other study options, just in case:
New Cards / Day: 200000
Session Time Limit: 0
Session Question Limit: 0

Maybe related:
When &quot;New cards spacing&quot; is set to &quot;spread out through reviews&quot;, I have 
the feeling that sometimes the &quot;Congratulations&quot; message is shown too 
early.

I think ive found the issue. Make sure you have ASE, as well as the
browser completly shut down before you open ankidroid as ankimini and
ASE are using the deck which gives ankidroid errors.

So basicly if both of the programs are using it at the same time it
will crash ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 99 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Load a deck that uses images from the internet (not stored on local sdcard)
2. use the deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
One would expect to see the linked image.  Instead, a white question mark
on a small blue background is displayed.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Stock AnkiDroid off the Market running on Motorola Droid with 2.1-update1

Please provide any additional information below.
I have attached below a deck that was created in Anki using the Smart.fm
Importer plug-in.  The desktop version of Anki does display the images.  I
do not know if this is a bug, or simply not yet supported.

Let's keep a list of characters that are known to not work:
- Farsi (reported by Ryan)
- Arabic (reported by Casey)
- Ancient Greek polytonic diacritic marks (issue 77)

Those issues seems to be a limitation of Android.
The workarounds seems not be out of reach for the typical user.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 106 Version 0.4

Once you complete a deck and get the deck complete message, whenever you
come back the message remains. So if you go to the home screen and come
back a few hours later the message remains. The fix is go back to the deck
picker and reopen the deck, then it regenerates the due cards and it's back
to normal, but this is non obvious and if you continously complete your
deck if 30 minutes or so, it gets a tad annoying.

I'm not sure about the best way to fix this though, but maybe the @onresume
for the activity? If you have at least one card still due it's not a
problem, only when there are no cards due, so do a check if no cards are due.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 109 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck.
2. Review some cards/complete a review session (not sure if this step is
necessary).
3. Wait a few days.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The due cards count keep increasing even if ankiDroid is not used. Let's
say the number of new cards added per day is 30, if I don't check ankiDroid
for 3 days I find 90 new cards waiting for review.

I expect to have new cards added just if I use ankiDroid, even better, just
when I finish a review session.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Tested both in the current market release and in a beta release for the
synchronization (was it from Edu?).

I know a SRS system should be used daily (that will free me from this
issue) but sometimes I just can't and finding lots of cards waiting for me
(more than I can process) keeps me from reviewing (increasing the number of
new cards added ;)

Clicking force quit on the error message simply brings the message up again. It has
to be tricked by continuously pressing the mobiles back button while pressing force
quit until it exits (usually second or third attempt).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 138 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.  Review cards with a deck on my MacBook.  This includes 10 new cards daily, which
is how many new cards I want each day.
2.  Synchronize the deck on my MacBook online.
3.  Synchronize the deck on my HTC Evo with Ankidroid.
4.  Review cards in Ankidroid.  This again includes 10 new cards, which is 10 more
than I want because I have already had 10 new cards with regular Anki.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would like Ankidroid to be able to recognize when I have already gone through the
new cards for the day, and not give me new cards if I have done so.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
I am using Anki 1.0.0 on Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Ankidroid 0.5alpha1 on my HTC Evo with
Android 2.2.

Please provide any additional information below.
Thanks for making a great piece of software!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 139 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Edit the default country-capitals file to have some style formatting, eg Question
color set to red.

2. Save the new country-capitals file to a path other than the default one in the cellphone.

3. Open the country-capitals file in the default location (like from fresh install)

4. Change the deckpath to the one where the edited deck is found.

5. Switch to the country-capitals deck (now it's the new one)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expected that the new style would take effect. Instead the old one is used
(black). If I kill AnkiDroid and start it again, then the new style takes effect as
the Models hash maps are repopulated anew.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Anki 0.4.1, android 2.2, nexus one.

Please provide any additional information below.
The issue raises the question of how fresh the values in a cache hashmap of Android
applications. When the application is closed (paused in reality), it might restart
several hours/days later with cached values that are really stale.
I suggest we reset the Model caches during onResume() or onCreate()

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 145 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Install the last development version of AnkiDroid master branch (http://github.com/iniju/Anki-Android/commit/3235cb8dd9601fe0cdfe896b1f31105dbb8061c3)
2. Launch AnkiDroid and you could see that the option to display both question and
answer at the same time is selected by default
3. Go to 'Menu' &gt; 'Preferences'
4. Go back, and now only the question or the answer is displayed, but not both at the
same time

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

If we don't change any option in Preferences, the expected behaviour would be to keep
everything the way it was before entering Preferences.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 147 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck, eg country-capitals. Set the preference &quot;Write answer&quot; to off.

2. View a question, then show the answer.

3. Go to preferences and set &quot;Write answer&quot; to show.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect that the buttons for difficulty will be still shown when I exit preferences
screen. Instead they disappear. They appear again, if I redisplay question and then
show answer again.

While annoying, it's even worse when the option for &quot;Show question in answer&quot; is set
to show, because then the button &quot;Redisplay Question&quot; is missing as expected, but that
leaves me stuck, as the only button remaining is the one for whiteboard. To move on,
I have to switch decks and select the same again.

open deck used last. I have more than one deck and when I start to learn I first want
to see an overview what has to be learned. 
Maybe there could be introduced an option for this?

			<bugID>Issue #1087</bugID>
			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 184 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review a deck in Anki, but leave some cards due/failed
2. Sync to server
3. Sync deck in AnkiDroid
4. The card count will be off by a few, it seems to update the count to the correct
(maybe?) count as soon as a new card is done instead of a failed/due card.
5. If you sync to the server from AnkiDroid, the count will be messed up in Anki (like
right now I have different counts in my AnkiDroid deck than on my Anki deck even though
it says the deck is synced. I'm not sure if it's just the count being messed up or
the designation of the card being due/failed (which would obviously be much more concerning).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
When you sync with card remaining to be reviewed/failed, the counters in AnkiDroid
should be the same as the counters in Anki, but the count is off.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid 5.alpha3 on Froyo
Anki 1.0.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Sorry if the explanation is a little confusing, I'm not 100% sure how to replicate
this.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 194 Reported by Eugeni:

When I edit a card in AnkiDroid and use the new sync feature the
changes don't sync correctly to Anki Desktop:

On Anki Desktop I sync to check if the edit done on the phone was
synced to the pc but it's strange because when I search for the fact
on AnkiDesktop it shows the edit on the index but not on the bigger
display boxes below. And also on Anki Desktop when the card
(previously edited in AnkiDroid) comes up while reviewing it does not
show the changes previously made while on AnkiDroid.

For now I'll stick to Dropbox whenever I have to edit facts on the
phone.

Thanks for Anki and Ankidroid! They're awesome!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 197 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. load attached sample deck
2. step through cards

What is the expected / proposed output?
An image that fits the size of the screen for the device your are using.

What do you see instead?
an image at ?full? size - too large to fit screen, requiring user to scroll to see
the whole thing.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid-0.5alpha4-sync-EXPERIMENTAL.apk on Motorola Droid with 2.2 (FRG22D)

Please provide any additional information below.
I'm not sure if this would always be desirable - it's conceivable that some images
need to be full size to be properly viewed.  But from my limited experience, auto-scaling
would be good.

Sorry if the sample deck is to US centric - it's one I got with desktop Anki and iKnow
plugin.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 198 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Display the question part of your card
2. Lock your phone (or switch to another application)
3. Switch back to AnkiDroid
4. The timer has continued in the background.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The timer should pause when AnkiDroid is not active. I wouldn't have noticed except
I was playing with the default deck and the session time limit was reached, even though
I had locked my phone.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 200 What steps will reproduce the problem?
---In the Desktop Anki
1. Create a deck. Format the fields, save it, like usual. [e.g.: sample.anki]
2. Make a copy from the deck in your file manager, or with save as, or with export.
[e.g.: copy.anki]
3. Open the new deck, mess with the formatting, and save it. 
4. Upload the decks to the phone
---In AnkiDroid
5: Open the sample.anki. Looks good. After that switch to the copy.anki. Formatted
exactly like the sample.anki. If you kill anki from the memory, and open the copy.anki,
it is good. If you switch to the sample.anki, it will be formatted as per the copy.anki.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expected different formatting, but there is no format change between the decks I
mentioned before, even if I open different decks. The only solution is to kill AnkiDroid
from the memory.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Android 2.1, AnkiDroid 0.4.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Please check on it, because it was really annoying and confusing when I tried to optimize
the formatting to the AnkiDroid ;)

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Uncompress the attached deck on '/sdcard/AnkiDroid'

3. Open that deck on AnkiDroid

I expect the sync to finish correctly and the deck to be uploaded to AnkiOnline. Instead
of that, AnkiDroid just crashes.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
In a card with an image on the question
1. Make zoom in or zoom out
2. Click 'Show Answer'
3. If you made zoom in you will see that the image is now zoomed out and if you made

I will expect that answering or grading a card will reset the zoom to the default value
or at least leave it with the same value that it had.

It should maintain the same view it had before because the state of the deck has not

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 214 When a fact has multiple cards, AnkiDesktop spreads the cards out so you don't see them
all within a short period.  I think it's about 10 minutes of delay between cards. 
This would be a nice addition to AnkiDroid if it's simple to implement.  In fact, I
think this use to happen in earlier builds.

Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 217 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Learn cards
2. Open another program (e.g. answer a call)
3. Switch back to AnkiDroid

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid 0.5, beta 8

Please provide any additional information below.

I learned a bunch of 62 due cards and reduced them down to 10 cards (all all them were
cards I didn't know a the first try, in other words: &quot;red ones&quot;). Then I had to use
another app and went afterwards back to AnkiDroid. 
Now the deck summary showed again 62 cards and when I started to learn them again the
congrats screen popped up immediately.

Start downloading a shared deck that takes short time to finish.
3.
Wait until the short one finishes and watch the list of downloads.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the short one to be removed and the long one to remain, instead, the long
one is removed and the short one remains showing fully completed. In reality the long
one is still being updated, but the information shown is for the short one.

If the short download was first in the list, then it all works properly. The issue
is with removing downloads that are completed further down the list.

During that time the phone is working very intensely in the background even after AnkiDroid
is closed, slowing down general performance.

While the PAUSE/RESUME capability will help fix that issue a bit, any idea for speeding
up the overall process is welcome.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 232 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck with cards containing images (I only tested images, since none of
my decks have audio anyway) and save it with Korean characters in the filename (may
actually be any non-Latin characters, but I've only tried Korean).
2. Either copy this deck to the device or sync it via Anki-Online then copy the media
folder manually (same behavior both ways).
3. Attempt to view any card with an image using AnkiDroid v0.5 alpha 8.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
X displayed instead of the expected image.  Confirmed this happens for static GIF,
animated GIF, JPG, and PNG.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Motorola Droid X (Android 2.2)
AnkiDroid 0.5 alpha 8

Please provide any additional information below.
This bug does not occur in the marketplace version of AnkiDroid, but does in 0.5 Alpha
8 (have not tried other versions than those two).  After a fair bit of testing, the
only consistency I can find is Korean characters in the filename.  Attached is a sample
deck that works fine with the marketplace version of AnkiDroid, but will not load images
in 0.5 alpha 8.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 234 I think this should not be allowed because:

- There's little reason for someone to want to do this, unless accidentally.
- Problem with media folder. When the first of the two finishes the media folder gets
moved. The second doesn't have a media folder. Not a big problem as they can share
it, except what if I cancel one download (media folder should get deleted, then the
other other doesn't have one).

Do you mind if we disallow downloading a shared deck while its download is ongoing?

On a related topic. What happens if I download a shared deck that I already have and
use? Will it overwrite the old one? What about the media folder?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 239 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start downloading a personal deck
2. Lose connectivity to the internet during the download
3. Phone responsiveness slows down and eventually (few minutes later) results to automatic

My phone is Nexus One, running Android 2.2.

There seems to be some kind of onPause - onResume cycle triggered by the release of
the InputStream in the finally clause of the try block where the personal download
happens, in DownloadManagerService.java, when I lose connectivity.

Working on fixing this, this issue is for record keeping.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 246 First let me apologize for not being able to pinpoint or describe this issue very well.
I'll do my best.

This is more of a quirk than an issue. I've set the fonts and background colors on
almost all of my models. I've noticed that these settings sometimes bleed into the
models I've never adapted from the defaults.  That is to say, that cards I'm expecting
to have a black font and white background may have the color scheme of a previous card
from a different model.

My theory, strange and uneducated as it is, is that this could be related to the fact
that I formed almost all of my models at a COPY of another model.  On my desktop Anki,
I used to have problems with merging decks that had models that were copies of each
other. I had split off some decks from my main deck and later decided to merge them
back in. Even if I had changed the model names and attributes, it was like they somehow
instinctually found each other once again when merged and started mingling, sometimes
completely supplanting another model.

Part of that problem was that I was exporting the cards from the smaller decks by directly
writing to bigger deck.  Since then, that function has been disabled since it wasn't
Damien's intention for the export function. I think now it would replace the entire
deck, but back then, it added the exported cards to the existing deck.  I only mention
all of this in case it could be related to how the models are treated in the desktop
software as well.  In the desktop version I don't have this fonts/colors issue however.

5. Press any of that buttons.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I think they should do something. But even &quot;Finish&quot; button doesn't finish anything.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

0.5alpha8

Please provide any additional information below.

This is HTC Wildfire with Android 2.1.

1. download a deck
2. hit synchronize

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Anki should sync my deck &quot;Standard&quot;, instead it creates a new one called &quot;eb6d8ae6f20283755b339c0dc273988b&quot;.
When I delete the deck online, I can reproduce the error. The new deck is always called
the same.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 263 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Open a deck with big font-size flashcards
2.Click to show answer.
3.Scrown down until you can't do it anymore.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The dates for next review should be fixed and with an opaque background, like the buttons.
Also, it should not cover the answer, at least when you scrow down all the way.
I also would like that the font-size for the cards be lowered in cases like this...
the font size is good for my desktop, but not for my phone....but this is another issue.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid-0.5alpha10-sync-EXPERIMENTAL
Samsung Galaxy i7500 (old galaxy)
Custom rom based on Android 1.6 and with custom theme (galaxo+DMA).
Screen resolution: 320x480 - 160dpi

Please provide any additional information below.
My issue is similar to the number 254: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=254

BUT, I never had the problem described in that other issue. I already used v0.4.2 and
0.50alpha8, besides the current alpha 10, and the buttons never went over the cards
in that way, nor they do now.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 272 [Using 0.5alpha11 and 0.5alpha12]

Since a week or so, I often receive the following popup:
&quot;Application AnkiDroid (in process com.ichi2.anki) is not responding.&quot;

This usually happens when I come back to my phone after a few minutes.
I then click &quot;Wait&quot; a few times to let it finish its calculations, and then I can review
as usual.

So what is AnkiDroid calculating so hard?
I am not sure, but it seems that it is checking all decks. The following appears in
the log:

1. Start ankidroid, previously selected deck opens automatically
2. Select menu / sync
3. Infos &quot;Connecting...&quot;, &quot;Fetching summary from server&quot; appear consequently. Ankidroid
crashes.
3. The attached log was created by Log Collector.
4. On next start, ankidroid does not automatically create a bug report.
5. When trying to sync again, it is usually possible to get one step farther (i.e.
to Determining differences - then crash. On next sync I got to &quot;transfering payload&quot;
- then crash). Sometimes it even does sync completely.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 274 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I try to sync some of my decks, sometimes it does not sync and just returns what
was there previously
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the deck with updated values for reviews and new cards. It only returns
the values that were previously there for SOME decks. Some sync fine. I can't pinpoint
what the difference in decks is: all my decks are &gt;120 cards and contain pictures.
Really limiting my usage

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
.5alpha8 on Motorola Droid 2.2

1. Download private anki deck
2. load private anki deck
3. compare number of due cards

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It has been normal with ankidroid (for my database with AnkiDroid 0.5 alpha8), that
there is a small difference in due cards from time to time. (like: one or two cards
more on my android phone if I remember correctly) Today I tried the newest release
and I get 712 due cards on ankidroid vs 469 on desktop anki.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid-0.5alpha14-sync-EXPERIMENTAL.apk

Please provide any additional information below.

I did run a full database check on desktop anki (without any negative things found)
and I did try deleting the anki file on my phone and redownloading it. The results
remained the same. Just repeating a few cards on my desktop anki and syncing didn't
change the result either.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It stays with the status &quot;Updating&quot; until the ankidroid crashes. 

If you click to open this deck, before it crashes in the &quot;open another deck&quot; screen,
it will crash loading the deck, and will do so every time you try to open ankidroid
again. The only way out of it is deleting the deck in ankidroid folder or reinstaling
ankidroid.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
AnkiDroid-0.5alpha14-sync-EXPERIMENTAL.apk
Anki 1.0.1 on the desktop.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 294 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Upgrade AnkiDroid from alpha8 to alpha14.
2. Run it.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Now every time I'm running AnkiDroid I'm getting &quot;Deck Could Not Be Loaded&quot; message.
But if I push &quot;Load Other Deck&quot; button and select mydeck it works.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

alpha14

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 295 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Using alpha15, sync your deck to AnkiOnline.
2. On your desktop, Download Personal Deck using Anki 1.0.1

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Instead of opening downloaded deck I'm getting an exception:

{{{

After dumping mydeck.anki from SD card and restoring it on the desktop using commands
like this

  sqlite3 mydeck.anki .dump | sqlite3 mydeck.anki

Anki 1.0.1 opens this deck.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

I'm using fresh alpha15 on Android 2.2.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 296 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. AnkiDroid 0.5alpha14, 15, or 16
2. Anki Desktop 1.1.13
3. Sync deck from AnkiDroid to AnkiDesktop. AnkiDesktop to AnkiDroid works fine.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect if I complete cards showing due in 5, 10, 20, XX, days, I will see this reflected
in the desktop version.

Instead, these cards show as complete in the desktop version, but all due in 41.0 years
ago, regardless of their actual due date. See the following screenshot.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid 0.5alpha14, 15, or 16
Anki Desktop 1.1.13

Please provide any additional information below.
Everything seems to be syncing correctly except for this due date issue only when syncing
from Droid to Desktop. The other direction (Desktop to Droid) functions well. 

Prior to this, I was using AnkiDroid alpha8 with Desktop 1.0.1 and working perfectly.
I then upgraded to AnkiDroid alpha14, which upgraded my deck while remaining with Desktop
1.0.1 and began to notice the error. Then, I upgraded to Desktop 1.1.13 hoping to resolve
the error, but still see it. 

Please help, I have been trying to figure out this issue for many many hours! Thank
you!

 I've tried downloading it again and I get the same thing.

I'd expect to see my Staples and be able to study them, instead Ankidroid crashes while

I've tested any version between alpha8 and 18, none is working. I couldn't even install
alpha17. My Archos 101 Internet Tablet is running Android 2.2.1 (firmware 2.0.71).

Please provide any additional information below.
I've sent an Issue report from Ankidroid yesterday, hope that helps.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 307 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a deck with gif images (and sounds, in my case)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I only see &quot;blue blocks with an interrogation mark&quot;

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.5 alpha18

Please provide any additional information below.

I have other decks with pictures that work fine, but these have instead jpg files.
I've tried &quot;cleaning&quot; the models of the facts in the desktop version, deleting unnecessary
information, so it could match the ones used in other decks with .jpg pictures, that
work fine. I've also tried to change the directory of AnkiDroid decks. But the issue
persists. Even more, the deck with the problem have also sound files that reproduce
correctly, so I don't think that it has to do with identifing the .media folder (it
does it correctly).
So I think that the problem is in the handling of .gif pictures by the program itself.


Thanks!

Anki normally plays the audio of the fact. Instead, there is echo which makes it incomprehensible.

The one avaiable in AndroidMarket. Android 2.2.

Please provide any additional information below.
I use an tablet. The facts'sound is often in wav. format.

I've created this staple as an example, but it's happening quite regularely, especially
on very short audio files(but not only).
Anki 1.2.2 is playing them back normal.

It isn't something keeping me from using AnkiDroid in any way, but i thought it might
be better to report it before you update the Market version.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 316 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Reviewing cards
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I still have problems with clicking on show answer. The button is too small or too
close to the bottom. The HTC G2 has a touch back button right at the bottom of the
screen and it becomes a very conscious effort to click the upper part of &quot;Show Answer&quot;
button. This was really not a problem at all in the current market version because
the whiteboard and time were underneath the &quot;Show Answer&quot; button and there was nothing
to worry about.

Can you add an option to move the show answer button up a bit? Or perhaps you could
add the timer and whiteboard button below &quot;show answer&quot; just like in the market version.
This current state makes a person not want to study because it's a burden to watch
out what you press and gives a subconscious weight on studying with Anki.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
beta6 version

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 317 Sometimes a card is shown blank. Pressing on MENU twice refreshes the screen, so it
is not a big issue.
I think it never happens when first displaying cards, it might be linked to switching
applications and the WebView is not redrawn.
It might be an Android 1.5 issue.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 319 Sometimes when only failed cards remain in the total queue, there is a problem in the
building of failed queue:

answer &quot;again&quot; should shift to another position of the queue (mostly at the end) but
instead, the card stays at the top and is immediately shown again. 

This does only (but always) happen with failed card which were mature cards before.
The deck is set not to reset mature card on &quot;again&quot;-button but to multiply the interval
with 10% and delay the next show to the next day (I followed Damien's recommendations
in that regard). 

Another problem: these (former mature) cards are shown always at the end of the queue.
Instead they should be distributed over all cards in total queue.

Cards are set to be shown in random order.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 323 Using AnkiDroid 0.5beta6 on an Archos 28 running Android 2.2.1.

These steps reproduce the problem with the default &quot;country-capitals&quot; deck, as well
as another deck of mine:

1. Sync the deck.
2. Immediately sync the deck again (without reviewing or changing any cards).

Expected behavior: &quot;No changes&quot;.
Actual behavior: &quot;Full sync from local&quot; again.

Thanks to dae in #ankidroid for suggesting that I add the following comments:

&quot;is ankidroid passing v2 to the upload call? is it setting the local sync time based
on the reply from the server?&quot;

&quot;is ankidroid making sure the clock is no more than 5 minutes off?&quot;

(That second comment was after I mentioned that there may be a time-zone issue causing
the last-modified dates on files on my Android device to be 5 hours in the future.)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 333 Using AnkiDroid 0.5beta11 on an Archos 28 running Android 2.2.1.

Currently the double-tap gesture (to answer a card with one ease above recommendation)
is enabled even when the other gestures are disabled (by Preferences &gt; Swipe).

I would like to see the double-tap gesture disabled when Swipe is disabled.

If this is done, perhaps the Swipe preference should be renamed to &quot;Enable gestures&quot;
to make it more general. Then the summary text in the preference screen could be something
like: &quot;Swipe horizontally to switch between screens and vertically to answer cards
(down: again, up: recommendation, double-tap: easier than recommendation)&quot;

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 337 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. review a deck
2. As you go through and review cards, watch the three numbers at the top (# Failed
in red, # Reviews in black and # New in blue)
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output is that AnkiDroid will underline the appropriate number depending on
whether the current card is a Failed, Review, or New card.
Instead, I sometimes see that none of the three are underlined.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Noticed this with .5beta5, still occurs on .5beta10
Using Android 2.2.1

Please provide any additional information below.
It seems that it goes in streaks - i.e.: several are underlined as expected in a row,
then several in a row have none of the three underlined.

After a crash, AnkiDroid offers to send an error report. I push the button to send
the report, but I get &quot;No applications can perform this action.&quot;

I'm not familiar with how the error reports are sent. Is it by email? I don't have
email set up on this device.

If AnkiDroid were to save the error report in a file, I'd be happy to manually send
that file to whoever needed to see it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 340 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. make a new model template using custom formatting e.g. make a model called &quot;sentences&quot;
and a template called &quot;forward&quot; which has white text for all fields on a black background.
2. Download the deck to ankidroid and open it.
2. Review a card model = &quot;sentences&quot;, template = &quot;forward&quot;.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: White text on a black background
Actual: White text on a white background

the &quot;reverse&quot; template is black text on a white background and that works fine.

In anki on my PC it works - all cards appear correctly and i can edit them (both anki
1.0 and 1.X). in ankidroid 0.5 alpha 8 it worked fine.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Ankidroid 0.5 beta 10
Anki 1.2.3

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 342 Currently using AnkiDroid 0.5beta12 on an Archos 28 running Android 2.2.1; over the
past few days I've been using the various beta versions as they are released.

I've had AnkiDroid crash a few times, and when I tried to send an error report, I got
the message &quot;No applications can perform this action.&quot; This may be because I did not
have an email account set up on my Android device: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=338

I'd like to see AnkiDroid offer to save the error report as a file, which I could later
retrieve from my Android device's storage and manually send to the developers (e.g.
from my desktop machine), without the need to have an email account set up on the Android

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 356 Will try make this make sense.

1. I do a bit of studying, and have a few failed cards, e.g. 8
2. I press the back button on my phone to go back to the study options screen to stop
the timer.
3. I return later in the day to study, and the first cards to come up are the failed
cards
4. If I get a failed card wrong, the failed count goes down by one, even though it
should stay the same.
5. If I then get review cards or new cards wrong, the failed count does not change
6. If I go back to the Study Options screen and back in, the failed count will be correct
again

This doesn't happen all the time, but enough times that I have noticed.


I'm using Beta 15, and I am using a HTC Desire running Froyo. 

Hope that makes sense! If you need me to clarify anything let me know

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 361 I just had the following issue:

I started syncing and half way through I received a phonecall.
After the phonecall I returned to AnkiDroid and found it stuck at &quot;Transferring payload...&quot;

A check at ankiweb.net reveals that the payload wasn't sent.

The log was stuck at:
...
I/AnkiDroid(22505):     ---youngEase2 = 140
I/AnkiDroid(22505):     ---youngEase3 = 4
I/AnkiDroid(22505):     ---youngEase4 = 36
I/AnkiDroid(22505): applyPayload
I/AnkiDroid(22505): onSaveInstanceState: /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/country-capitals.anki
I/AnkiDroid(22505): onSaveInstanceState - Ending

I'm not sure how to handle this interruption. Obviously the UI is able to resume, but
it will be hard to resume the Connection procedure from where it stopped. What happens
to the Connection thread in such a case anyway?

It's probably safer to just inform the user that the syncing was interrupted and have
a Retry and a Cancel button.

Obviously this is low priority, because it's rare to happen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 366 Syncing always reports uploaded facts but the count is build by the number of uploaded
cards.

I just edited one fact of a two-cardmodels-model. As a consequence, both cards are
updated. When I synced directly afterwards, the sync protocol said: &quot;uploaded two facts&quot;
instead of &quot;uploaded two cards&quot; because only one fact was changed but two cards.

I think it's not necessary to give a result of both changes as anki desktop does. It
should be enough just to let the result be &quot;uploaded x cards&quot;.

What do you think?

Hello Damien, I am testing 1.2.5 Anki package on Fedora.  The message &quot;Session Limit
Reached&quot; pops-up randomly but frequently not matter the deck I use (they are all testing
decks with 5 to 10 cards only).

I have seen a bug trace marked as fixed URL http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=42

In my case, the message pops-up during editing, reviewing, template editing, etc. 
not only after reviewing cards.

Do I contact the Fedora maintainer about the package, or is it software related.  Thanks.

I thought we were safe from this, because we compiled with minSDKVersion 1.5, but...
apparently it does happen.

I'll have to add a workaround, as this can trigger at upgrading deck, which makes unable
to use AnkiDroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 385 I just tried installing AnkiDroid on a friend's phone, and the sample deck does not
load, it says upgrade failed.
We should ship AnkiDroid with a compatible sample deck.
This might force us to release a 0.5.1 in a few hours.
Can anyone confirm?

I installed Anki Droid on my Motorola Android phone. A blue light flashes in the corner
of my phone when I go into sleep mode -- no other app does this, and I can't find a
tool in the preferences to turn it off. Ideas?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 396 This is an enhancement to the current error reporting tool to change it from an email
to an HTTP post.

The post URL is defined in the constants.xml as error_post_url. It can't be localhost/127.0.0.1
since that points at the emulator.

The posted keys are all lowercase: reportsent; reportgenerated; device; host; availableinternalmemory;

See: http://groups.google.com/group/anki-android/browse_frm/thread/77c0ec95bd813ad1

Should I translate both to the same string?
The only way to differentiate them is this barely visible message:
studyoptions_window_title[one]
studyoptions_window_title[other]
which is not that helpful.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 413 When answers are shown, the cards faces are not stacked (question
on top, answer on the bottom). Instead, it will place the answer next
to the question, which messes up the display of course. My templates
use div and span tags and use css to format those tags. 

My guess is that anki does some post processing of HTML or when the sound icon is inserted
or something that messes up the HTML in a way normal anki does not.


Attached is a deck that reproduces the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 421 I tried it now several times, always the same:

1. Synced a deck which was changed on both sides, chose &quot;local&quot; on question on which
version should be kept.

2. Synced from Anki Desktop. It always says: no changes found

3. Deleted deck in Anki Desktop, downloaded synced deck anew: deck equals now the deck
on AnkiDroid

in a nutshell: Total sync works, but there must be a problem with the timestamp since
Anki does not recognise a new version.

Cheers!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 428 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. On Ankidroid (i think 0.5.1, how can is see which version I have installed?) I choose
&quot;sync all&quot; in the deck selection screen.

2. One of my two decks synchronises, the other one returns: &quot;Error: Deck has not been
synchronised.&quot;

I had synced the deck in question before, so I have no idea, why all of a sudden i
get this error.
Can I check a log file somewhere?

I did some days of study, but now I need to add more facts to the deck, using Anki
1.2.5 on my PC.
I hope there is a way to solve this without loosing my study logs.

As I said, I think I use Ankidroid 0.5.1 (again, how to find out?)
I have a Nexus S with stock Gingerbread 2.3.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 432 Hello Ankidroid developers,

Selecting &quot;Again&quot; and editing cards leads to frequent crashes of Ankidroid on my phone
(HTC desire, Android 2.2). There was no crash for other answeres. It only crashes when
I select &quot;Again&quot; or try to edit a card.

The problem exists since I changed from Ankidroid 4.2 to Ankidroid 5.1.
I am considering to change back to 4.2. Anyone else with similar problems?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 434 (I'm not sure what causes the problem. However I'm opening the issue to see if others
are having the same problem and I'll update it as I learn more.)

I have 3 decks and I've had the problem on two of them (one is only 25 facts so it's
not a size problem). I go to the available decks screen and the number of cards to
test fails to calculate for one of the decks. I can wait ten minutes and it never finishes.
If I click on the deck I get an 'unable to load deck' screen. Opening the deck in anki
(version 1.2.7 I believe) and saving it solves the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 435 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. It happens randomly but I'm on the deck list.
2. I choose a deck.
3. I get a new available decks list (I say new because all the stats start to calculate
again)
4. Selecting a deck from this screen results in an 'unable to load deck' page.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Ankidroid .5.1
Anki 1.2.6

Please provide any additional information below.
I can quit and restart ankidroid and that usually solves the problem.

Normally I would expect the decks shown to be limited to the search word, instead I
have to change the search term by a single character to get the desired search to show.
This can be quite tedious if you are downloading multiple shared decks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 440 In normal mode everything looks alright (black text, white background). But in nightly
mode (nachtmodus) both text and background are white and the text is therefore not
legible.

Fix probably includes forcing background color of question/answer fields to black too,
if nightly mode is selected. Header (numbers/time) and bottom (buttons) already have
a black background.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 441 Hi all,

I have a HTC Legend and Ankidroid seems to work quite well therefore  bought my mother
a motorola milestone (german Droid, similar but not the same). She uses anki online
like I do.

So I installed 0.5.1 and tried to log in with her account for setting up syncing but
it does not work. When i try to log in there comes &quot;an network error occured&quot; / &quot;Es
ist ein Netzwerkfehler auftreten&quot; and I cannot log in. Usually she only uses WLAN and
youtube / Mail / Browser all work quite well, only ankidroid does not work. But I activated
mobile Internet (APN, UMTS) as well and it does not change anything. 
Even those steps did not work:
- trying 0.6 Beta3
- using my account instead of my mothers

Suprisingly, I can download public decks, but NOT personal decks. Unfortunately I cannot
test it with custom ROMs because the Milestone has a locked bootloader, therefore u
cannot change the OS.

What am I supposed to do? I have really no idea. FW Version is 2.1 Update-1

Thanks

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 445 What steps will reproduce the problem?

It seems random, and happens only with one card each day.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

A due card, when answered correctly, should not appear until the next days. However,
sometimes a card will appear constantly even if it's aswered correctly several times.
It's reappearance follows a pattern of once each two cards, i.e. the card reappears,
then another due card, then another time the &quot;cursed&quot; card. The due counter seems to
work correctly, so in fact, the card that keeps appearing is substituing other due
cards. This leads to a crash when the due counter is reduced to 0, and when ankidroid
restarts, another bunch of due cards appears (surely, these must be the due cards that
the &quot;cursed&quot; card substituted before the crash). I've doublechecked in the card browser
that this isn't a problem of duplicated cards in the deck. 

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

I'm currently using 0.6 alpha 0.4 on Android 2.2, but in fact, this problem happens
at least since 0.6 alpha 0.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 446 I try to figure what describes the different colours in the progress bars of the deck

of new reviewed cards (i.e. the deck completion percentage). But what represents the
white bar? It could be explained somewhere. At present, with so many new functions,
it would be useful to have a &quot;help&quot; section in the program.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 449 
Today NorbertNagold kindly answered me about what represents the white part of the
progress bars. Well, at the beggining I figured out this by myself, but something caused
to me some confusion: two of my longest-rewied decks showed a white bar that occupied
less of 10% of the total space of the bar, while the grey bar showed correctly nearly-completed.
I checked the stat graphs, of cumulative due cards in 1 year, and they showed the information
that should be represented by the white bar: almost 80% of the cards are mature, not
merely a 10%.

So the first question that I have made to myself is: what makes different these decks
from the others? I came easily to the answer: they are only small parts, activated
by tags, of much larger decks, much of them disabled by tags. 
So, while the grey bar is based on the degree of completion of the tag-activated cards,
I suspect that the white bar is showing information based on the whole deck, tag-activated
or tag-suspended. I find this confusing, since the overlapping of the bars (white and
grey) would rather suggest that the two draw information on the same basis, but I find
they doesn't.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 450 Hi

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. create deck with jpg on back (like copy pasted a lecture slide)
2. Sync with dropbox
3. Try to learn on mobile device(htc desire 2.1)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The question ist right, the answer (back) is blank or a image of a very small square
meaning a picture is missing.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
ankidroid 0.51 (latest), android (1 before gingerbread) without root

Please provide any additional information below.

After I choose dropbox sync in settings I need to input the adresse of the dropbox
folder which was created automatically. But it says the chosen folder is not public
(but it is truly the public folder!) These confused me, which is the correct path?
like c:/programms/dropbox/public/anki/mydeck ?

Is it just my problem or is this function not yet integrated?

Thanks for your answer

Also seems to take a lot longer moving from the card review mode back to the deck information

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 469 since a few days (two or three). I've experienced a very bad slowdown of AnkiDroid.
It needs sometimes four or more seconds for a card to load.

I traced it back to this routine this line in Deck.java:

cur = getDB().getDatabase().rawQuery(&quot;SELECT value FROM deckVars WHERE key = '&quot; + key
+ &quot;'&quot;, null);

which is called by updateCard --&gt; baseUrl = Utils.getBaseUrl(mMediaDir, myModel, currentDeck);
--&gt; if (deck.getBool(&quot;remoteImages&quot;)...

This rawQuery takes sometimes more thant four seconds to execute. the variable &quot;remoteImages&quot;
does not exist in the deck-db and it seems as if sqlite needs very long to learn that.
My db knowledge is poor, so I don't want to muck this about. Is this an index problem
maybe and how can we solve it?

To my mind we should store the value anyway in a deck variable instead of performing
always a db-operation for this value (which should be always the same).


It was probably introduced with the new fetch-images-code.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 471 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open AnkiDroid (mine defaults to Deck Picker)
2. Select a Deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect the deck to open for review
Sometimes, the deck does not open.  In the case for which the Log Collector log is
attached, the first time I selected a deck, I was dumped back to the Deck Picker after
a few seconds.  I then reselected the same deck, and was taken to a screen that indicated
it was an invalid deck, and to select a different deck.  I then reselected the same
deck again, and it opened normally.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
v0.5.1 from market on Android 2.2.1 on Motorola Droid

Please provide any additional information below.
- This does not occur all the time - it seems to occur more frequently when many cards
are due in more than one of my several decks - ie: after I skipped reviews for a day
or two.
- I don't recall it ever failing more than 3 times in a row.
- this was discussed briefly at https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=331

and if this space is exceeded, taking then (and only then) a second line for presenting

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 507 Using 0.6beta4.

When I'm in the deck-summary screen for a deck, and I want to:
switch to a different local deck,
download a deck,
create a deck,
sync all my decks,
view the About screen,
view statistics for all decks,
I have to choose &quot;Open Deck&quot; from the menu.

For some of those tasks, &quot;Open Deck&quot; doesn't seem like an intuitive menu choice. Perhaps
that menu item could be renamed. Here are some of my ideas:

&quot;Close Deck&quot; (Since we're closing the current deck. Anki Desktop 1.2.7 calls it &quot;Close&quot;.)

&quot;Other Decks&quot; (this encompasses other functions of the deck-picker that don't necessarily
involve actually opening a deck, such as downloading and syncing)

&quot;Main Screen&quot; (Even when the Startup Mode is configured so that AnkiDroid starts on
the study-options screen instead of the deck-picker, I still think of the deck-picker
as a kind of &quot;Main Menu&quot; or &quot;Home Screen&quot; for AnkiDroid.)

&quot;Deck-Picker&quot; (That's what the developers already call it anyway)

At various, non-repeatable times, the following message appears: &quot;Sorry!   Application
AnkiDroid (in process com.ichi2.anki) is not responding.&quot;  The user is given two choices:
&quot;Force Close&quot; or &quot;Wait&quot;.  I usually pick wait, and AnkiDroid does usually come back
without crashing.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid .6beta 3 on Android 2.2.1 on Motorola Droid.  This seems to happen much more
frequently with .6beta3 than with .6alpha9 and previous versions

Please provide any additional information below.
I have attached two log files from two slightly different situations:
1) Phone was on, but display was off.  I placed the phone in the dock, and the display
automatically comes on.  The error message above was displayed at around 3:32pm.
2) Phone was on, but display was off.  I turned on and unlocked the display.  The error
message above was displayed around 5:05pm)

I think that I have seen this message on scenarios other than when the display is just
turning on, but I don't have a log file.  I'll load .6beta6 now, and submit a log file
for other circumstances if they occur.

[---]
None... just did some cards yesterday and the ones that are supposed to show today
didn't show up. 
The choices I made were Hard, on all 5 new cards. They were supposed to show up today
(per day scheduling). Is this a problem in the intervals? Would the spacing need to
be longer, on my deck, for it to work properly? Currently, The deck from my computer
has the initial intervals of 1-2days (button2), 4-7days (button3), 12-21days(button4).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
[---]
AnkiDroid_ver: 0.6beta7
Android_ver: 2.2.1
Internet access: None, currently


Please provide any additional information below.
[---]
The desktop app has the ability to auto-select (spacebar) choice of hard and good.
This depends on how when a card has been shown. First time, one is shown, it auto selects
hard. Second time or more, it will choose good until one feels like choosing very easy(?).
This would be a highly recommended feature... as I don't select the choices. I let
the program choose based on that.

What happens, is I hit back and it takes me to whatever deck I last used (even if it

5. Do a few cards on the android and then synch the deck again (on android)

Expecting a few cards to synch with the server
Instead I am told that the deck has changed both locally and remotely - which do I
want to keep?

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Beta9, 2.2

Please provide any additional information below.
If I choose to keep the local deck, a full synch will occur and  (so far) the problem
will not recur. But when my decks initially got out of synch, probably by making changes
in both places, I wanted to avoid doing a full synch on the phone with a largish deck,
to conserve out internet quota. This happened with all my decks and was a problem prior
to beta9.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 547 This happens on 0.6 beta 9 as well as 0.5

I'm not sure how to reproduce this, it's random and I only usually notice a few days
after it happens. Usually there is no deck corruption.

I sync my deck on my phone normally after I finish all my reviews. Every few days I
sync it with the Anki desktop client. Sometimes after I sync on the desktop client,
I have an entire sync worth of cards that I've already answered in AnkiDroid, appearing
as due reviews in the desktop client. So the situation is that I have 0 cards due in
AnkiDroid and there is nothing to sync, and on the desktop client I have 20 (or whatever)
cards due and also nothing to sync. So one of the syncs from AnkiDroid didn't work.
The only way to fix it is to copy the deck from the sdcard over, answering the cards
again in the desktop client and syncing with AnkiDroid sometimes does corrupt the deck.

My guess would be that Anki server is not committing the changes, and AnkiDroid is
not handling the failed response properly/receiving a response and committing instead
of rolling back. The only thing I can think of that may cause this is when I sync I
sometimes have a rubbish signal, and my phone locks before the sync finishes. I may
then only unlock my phone a couple of hours later, so exactly what Android does with
this task, whether it tries to pause it or kill it, that may be the cause.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 549 I'm using (the latest) Anki on my computer and AnkiDroid (v0.5.1) on my HTC Desire,
Android 2.2; I'm learning Chinese with it and add new cards every other day when we
learn them in class. I do this by synchronizing from my phone, then the computer, adding
words there, and synchronizing again. All works fine. I do Anki only on my phone, not
on the computer (anymore), as I find it more convienient. I checked the option, that
the amount of cards doesn't change over the day, so it doesn't get more over the day,
but only on the day-day border. Know what I mean?

BUT... Every day some of the cards that I already know well (so the &quot;Hard&quot; button should
send the card, like, 5 or 7 days or more into the future) show &quot;1 day&quot; above the &quot;Hard&quot;
button again. It appears just like I had that card wrong the day before, but I know
I didn't. It happens many times, even though I know I got these cards right the last
time. But I couldn't find a pattern, it seems quite random. Also the amount of cards
&quot;resetting&quot; themselves is seemingly random.

There is another &quot;bug&quot;(?), perhaps related: I set the sessions to 10 minutes, during
which I usually manage to do about 30 cards. As an example, after those 10 minutes,
during the last card, the display shows e.g. 52 cards left to review and maybe 2 wrong
cards. But then in the next screen, when showing how many cards are left to be reviewed
this day, it almost always shows a smaller amount. Maybe 50 instead of 54 in this example.
It's only about 1 to 5 cards less, but still... this is very strange.
But it's not that they vanish — Anki asks me these cards again the next day(s). I haven't
yet figured out if it's maybe exactly *those* &quot;vanishing&quot; cards that are resetted to
a one-day-delay on the next day.

As this is the only Anki deck I'm currently doing, I have no idea if it happens with
other decks on the AnkiDroid app, too. And because I don't use Anki on the computer,
I also don't know if the problem occurs there as well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 553 
I noticed recently in two of my decks that failing some cards would result in a big
rising of tomorrow's due cards. The result is a bit weird: after reviewing some 100
cards and failing a 10%, tomorrow's due cards as shown in statistics jump from more
or less 40 to 200, and I finish sometimes having more queued cards for tomorrow that
the total ones I reviewed today!

Strangely enough, this only happens when I fail cards, thus if I don't review any card,
tomorrow I'll often have less cards than if I try to review them. The result is more
than a month having 300+ cards for review each day, even if I review them and pass
90%. It's so frustrating!

I tried in Anki Desktop and, seeing stat's graphs, the problem doesn't seems to happen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 556 comment from Yu at the list:
I noticed that in the list of texts to translate, there are lots of words
such as year/years, month/months, and day/days, which can be expressed by a
single Chinese character(年, 月, 日). So I dont know how to translate those
words precisely, or whether attach a measure word before a noun(it may have
a number before it to numerate) or not(it may not have a number before it).
Please provide some better contexts for those words if possible. Thanks.

We should indeed change all &quot;days&quot; to &quot;$1%d days&quot; to make it possible to choose the
position of the numbers and to make it clear for every developer in which sense a sentence
is used

This is a task for v0.7, since translation for v0.6 is quite advanced and shouldn't
be changed yet...

Seen in the Ankidroid-triage database instead:
reportA

reportC

This is because I did not click &quot;Clear all errors&quot; after each successful sending.
Most users will probably not dare click &quot;Clear all errors&quot; because they are not sure
what the button does. Result: the reports database will be crowded with duplicate reports,
distorting the bugs occurrence ranking.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 561 How to reproduce:
1) Find a Android 1.5 device (good luck with that!)
2) Enable TTS
3) Start reviewing
4) Immediately Force close:
E/AndroidRuntime( 2216): java.lang.VerifyError: com.ichi2.anki.ReadText
E/AndroidRuntime( 2216):    at com.ichi2.anki.Sound.parseSounds(Sound.java:92)

I guess TTS is not available in Android 1.5 or something.
I guess not showing the option, or something more graceful than crashing could be better,
but very low priority bug, because Android 1.5 is old, and just disabling TTS makes
the crash go away.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 563 When two siblings cards happen to be reviewed the same day, although I chose the randomize

Is there any way to solve this and to manage with siblings as in Anki ?


Thanks for help !

I can still change this option successfully on a desktop computer and then transfer

I also don't know if it takes a day or a restart to register the change, but if it
does, it would be a lot more useful if it was an instant change.

			<bugID>Issue #1489</bugID>
			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 586 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a anki file with an underscore (&quot;_&quot;) in the filename on a desktop computer.
2. Synchronize it to the server.
3. Download it in Ankidroid.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

To give an example: I create new_main.anki on my desktop pc, synchronize it to the
Anki Server (new_main is created there) and then download it using the built-in download
function of ankidroid. Here lies the problem: Ankidroid saves the file as &quot;newmain.anki&quot;.
The next time I synchronize with ankidroid a new database (newmain) is created on the
server thus preventing successful synchronization between ankidroid and desktop versions.

Obviously not using underscores in filenames is a viable workaround ... so this issue
probably has a low priority, but seeing that the filesystem of android as well as Ankidroid
'can' handle underscores (for example after uploading the &quot;new_main.anki&quot; to my phone
manually) it might be something 'fixable' at some point. ;)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The whiteboard state for the deck is reset (i.e., whiteboard is no longer enabled by
default).
Resetting languages should not affect the whiteboard state.

The problem is that MetaDB.resetDB() deletes all settings and it is invoked by the
&quot;Reset languages&quot; option.
I will add a separate method only for resetting languages.

In night mode, a white band shows in top and bottom of the review screen. The top band
covers the indicators area, and renders invisible the due cards counter. The bottom
band shows just above the answer buttons.
In the night mode first version of the error, it happens exactly the same except that
the bands are black and the middle of the screen remains white.

When returning to the first selected mode, the problem disappears, bur reappears when
re-switching to the first selected mode. Strangely enough, the problem seems to have

for a specific deck will continue to be the correctly displayed.

I would expect text from Card A (which is currently visible) to be copied to the clipboard.
However the text from Card B (which is not currently visible) has actually been copied.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid: v0.7alpha2

Please provide any additional information below.
Strangely, this does not happen in all my decks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 610 When editing the cards on computer, if I colored a word, say I make it red, and then
I changed my mind, I change it back to black. When I do this,I'll click the colors
button (or press F7) and click black, since black is already there in the drop down
menu, as the default color. Here's the problem - I did not clear the formatting, I
made it black. Then it's invisible in night mode.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 611 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Attempt to add a new card (Model:Japanese, Cards:Production, Recongition)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

When attempting to &quot;add&quot; the new card a pop-up window came up saying &quot;Saving Facts&quot;,
but it never went away. Ankidroid later crashed. I attempted to sync the deck to the
server and check it on PC. The PC client search said the card could not be found. I
tried to add it from the PC client but couldn't because it beleived that there was
a card for that Expression, even though I couldn't find it in a search. I attempted
to run the &quot;Advanced&gt; Check Database...&quot; function on the client and the card appeared
(wave form collapsed under observation I guess).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

0.7 Alpha 2 on Honeycomb 3.0.1 Motorola Xoom

Please provide any additional information below.
I only added text for the Expression and Meaning fields. Seems to be 100% reproducible.

Might I suggest that the top and bottom bars have a standard grey background, such
as many Android aps use?  In the Gmail ap, for instance, they use a grey background
at the bottom when you're reading an email.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The app should go back to reviewing, where it was left off.
Instead, it goes back to the study options.

This started happening with 0.7alpha releases and it is due to this change:
https://github.com/flerda/Anki-Android/commit/3be71bbdd9fcb544925da77a14f80f3305651c9a

The purpose of this change was to make widget and notifications work properly, i.e.,
open the given deck even if the app is already open. Unfortunately this causes the
bug described above.

Maybe adding:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
to those specific intents would be sufficient.

Rather than force closing, we should tip the user that the full SD card is problematic.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 660 This might be a misunderstanding on how settings work, or maybe a problem with Anki's
scheduling, but here's the problem:

I have been experimenting with different scheduling algorithms.  For one deck, I routinely
fail new cards.  I have set the button 1 delay to 30 minutes, so that the new cards
should show up shortly after I first see them.  At that point, I score them normally.

To do this, I've set the button 1 delay to 30 minutes and the show failed cards early
to False (in Anki.  This option isn't exposed in AnkiDroid).

The failed card delay seems to be working for non-new cards, but not with new cards.
 As I review new cards, the cards I just failed minutes before start showing up.  And
I can't stop them from showing up unless I give them a non-failure.  This even if I've
set new cards to appear before reviews.

Now maybe I'm just not understanding how this is supposed to work, but it seems like
when you say you don't want failed cards to appear early, they shouldn't appear early,
whether then next card should be new or not.  What's going on here?  Is this a bug
in Ankidroid, or in Anki's scheduling algorithm?

I am using Ankidroid 0.7 beta 3 at the moment

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 665 received feedback:

&gt; At one point I deleted all my stacks and turned off the creation of the map example.
From that point on it gave errors when starting. Uninstalling the app and reinstalling
didn't help. Somehow I got it to work again but I forget how. That was several versions
ago. It still gives me an error on startup but I can use the app.

Could someone please try and see whether this is still a problem?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 666 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Load couple of large decks (search for &quot;spanish&quot;, there are a couple of 8K+ decks)
2. Start working with the deck
3. Watch battery meter 

On what version of Android?
LG Optimus V stock 2.2 firmware

Please provide any additional information below.

I cannot be 100% certain that it's ankidroid as Android's battery consumption reporting
is bogus, at least in my version. However all three times I've tired the app, battery
started being drained very fast.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 669 Hey there

While revising the deck http://www.enabeliro.net/download/ez.anki (has conditional
text), especially most of the time when I'm having the last 15 or so cards which are
already on the &quot;error pile&quot; and go through them again and again, suddenly some fields
(the fields Tuttledef or English, depending if there is a Tuttledef field or not) are
not shown anymore for some of the cards.

I think it's the generated html that has an error. When I sync the deck to the desktop
client, those cards are still showing up without those fields. However, if I edit them
in the desktop client, they go back to normal.

Also, note that the formatting of the &quot;Tuttledef&quot; field is different on Ankidroid compared
to the desktop client most of the time (way to small on Ankidroid most of the time,
sometimes it renders correctly).

That's the only deck I have problems with. It's also my only deck which uses conditional
text. However, I believe the problems were already there before using conditional text,
I'm not sure though.

I have the problem since AnkiDroid v. 0.7beta3 and it's still there in beta6. I'm using
the latest Cyanogenmod 7.1.0-RC10-11.06.14 (2.3.4) on my Motorola Milestone.

Cheers,
Marcel

This is a known android issue but I saw a previous post that listed a additional script
that was added to the alpha version and now works.  I loaded this but the test was
still LTR instead of RTL.

Further info, my phone doesn't do RTL also but I know that the java work around should
correct this internal to the program.  

I can upload a deck to use as an example if desired

The screen automatically rotates after synchronizing the deck with Anki online even
though it is disabled in the phone options. Before the sync everything works as expected
(no rotation). Closing and re-opening the deck also fixes the auto rotating back to
disabled.

Seems to now be that the question is displayed in the Ankidroid default font. In the
deck I tried, it used to be default font for the answer and kanji stroke orders for
one field in the question.

I went back to beta 6 and my question displays in kanji stroke orders. I then tried
beta8 again and the question displays on the default font. I can get kanji stroke orders
into the question by making that my default font, but didn't want to do that.

The problem its also present in beta7.

5. You get a warning that the deck has changed locally and server-side and you have
to choose which to keep.  Keeping server-side (the one that includes the new cards
results in all your data from your previous study session to be deleted, so you have
to go through all your &quot;knowns&quot; all over again.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 687 Using AnkiDroid 0.7beta9 on Archos 28 with firmware 2.3.81 (Android 2.2.1).

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start reviewing my Heisig deck (tap &quot;Start Reviewing&quot; button).

2. First card appears. Tap &quot;Show Answer&quot;.

3. Answer appears (at least partially). Do not tap the answer buttons (Again/Hard/Good/Easy).
Wait 3 or 4 seconds. Screen turns black, then &quot;Loading deck. Please wait...&quot; appears,
then I'm back at the deck screen again. Can go back to step 1 and repeat, if desired.

Log from Log Collector is here: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mikemorr/ankidroidlog20110719.txt

This problem does not occur with my other decks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 689 I don't have any repro steps for this, but today AnkiDroid crashed while I was reviewing
and when I restarted the program, the deck I was reviewing was gone and the file was
no longer on my SD Card.

I think it would make sense to employ some periodic backup strategy like Anki standalone
does, so that if a crash corrupts or eliminates a deck, it's still possible to fish
out a recent version.

One of my personal decks will not download to my Ankidroid. It keep saying there was

Any ideas? The deck I am trying to download is also a shared deck: Persian (Farsi)
Flashcards

While I was never able to get it to work on that specific deck, I saved it under a
different name on my computer and then re-uploaded it, and then it did download to
ankidroid.

not sure why it worked then....? But it is ok now.

By Mike:
I was able to download the deck from the list of shared decks with no problems. After
downloading the deck, I did have difficulty opening the deck for the first time (it
seemed stuck on the &quot;Loading deck&quot; message). But I went to the System Monitor, force-stopped
all programs, and returned to AnkiDroid, and then I was able to load and review the
deck. Using 0.7beta12.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 694 From time to time, when loading a deck the progress dialog does not disappear although
the deck is fully loaded (logcat says: &quot;I/AnkiDroid( 9390): Deck loaded!&quot;, study options

Seems as if onPostExecute of mLoadDeckHandler is not executed. I was finally able to
reproduce this:

1. download farbtest.anki from mydecks
2. open android's message window
3. click on the deck's name to open it in ankidroid

I'm really puzzled, I've no clue, why this happens.

But because this seems to happen mainly for new downloaded decks, we should definitely
solve it before releasing!

Cheers!

files in Dropbox.

Any guidance would be appreciated.  I'm new to the Android world, so
don't really know where to begin.  Anki is a huge part of my daily
routine, though, so I would like to get this sorted as quickly as
possible.

Thanks for what otherwise seems to be an amazing app!

Also, the sync icon bug on the main deck screen is still there. You
have to activate the study options menu first in order to get the sync
button to work when you're at the main deck screen. (After you've
selected a deck, and before you start reviewing.)

Would it be possible to make this as an option as it is in Anki Desktop?

Anki Desktop allows to choose whether to display furigana in question by editing furigana.py
file.

In night mode, the display flashes white and it takes some time before showing the

I see a new card.

While reproducing the crash reported in Issue 720, I got a typical crash message (&quot;Sorry!...stopped
unexpectedly... Force close&quot;). (Using 0.7beta20).

Usually, when I start AnkiDroid the next time after such a crash, AnkiDroid's built-in
crash reporter will appear and offer to send a stacktrace report. But in this case
the reporter never appeared, so I grabbed the log with Log Collector instead.

Why didn't AnkiDroid's crash reporter appear after this crash? Does it only appear
for certain types of crashes?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 727 Using 0.7beta23 on Android 2.2.1.

Steps:
1. Load Minimal.anki and Minimal.media from Issue 720.
2. Start reviewing the Minimal deck in day mode.
3. Don't type anything in the box. Tap the &quot;OK&quot; button.
4. Go back and repeat steps 2 and 3, but in night mode.

Result: As expected, the standard Android &quot;Web page not available&quot; page appears in
the iframe (since a nonexistent HTML page is being requested). But in night mode, its
text is black on black, so the only visible parts are the blue link and the green/white
Android logo. Compare attached screenshots.

So, when the &quot;Web page not available&quot; page comes up in night mode, can either its text
or its background be changed to white, so the text is visible?

1. Open the attached deck in AnkiDroid. It's the country-capitals deck, but each card

2. Tap &quot;Limit&quot;, uncheck &quot;Session&quot;, and tap &quot;Save&quot;, to turn off limiting.
3. Tap &quot;Cram&quot;, check &quot;C&quot;, tap &quot;Start Cram mode&quot;, and tap &quot;Start Reviewing&quot;, to start
reviewing countries that start with &quot;C&quot; (Cambodia, Canada, etc.).
4. Answer the cards as &quot;Again&quot; about 10 times or so. The 5 cards starting with &quot;C&quot;

5. Now start answering the cards as &quot;Good&quot;. After each of the 5 &quot;C&quot; cards has been
answered &quot;Good&quot; once, AnkiDroid starts showing other cards (France, Peru, etc.)

tag.

Observed output: I'm seeing other cards besides the &quot;C&quot; cards.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 752 I'm using the newest AnkiDroid (0.7?) on an htc Desire with Android 2.2. I'm doing a
self-made deck called &quot;Beginner's Klingon&quot; (don't laugh!) which asks me English-Klingon
as well as Klingon-English. Both directions.

Until before the latest update (3 days ago or so), Anki always used to ask me new cards
in the direction English-Klingon. A card's sibling (in the direction Klingon-English)
appeared a few minutes later, sometimes the next day.

Now it's different: New cards are asked in a random direction. Some new cards appear
as English-Klingon, some as Klingon-English. I don't want it that way. Plus, the siblings
don't seem to be connected anymore. They do not appear shortly after their counterpart
anymore.

I just looked at a pair of cards' details. One card I have answered yesterday or the
day before is rescheduled to appear in 3 days. It's sibling, the other direction, shows
it's a new card that hasn't been asked yet. BOTH cards(!) show a changed date of &quot;25/08/2011&quot;.
That's yesterday. I did not change these cards yesterday, though. Another vocabulary
item, where both cards haven't been asked yet, both show &quot;13/07/2011&quot; as their changed
date — the date I created them.
A new card I have answered right now for the first time, shows today's date as changed
date. Its sibling, which I haven't seen yet (and which like will not appear anytime
soon), shows the same date. Again, I didn't modify them.
I see that anytime one answers a card, it get's &quot;changed&quot;, but I find it strange that
the sibling, which I haven't seen yet, is changed too. Maybe this is an old hat for
you, but I'm just saying... maybe it helps.

Please fix these two problems. :/

Have had the same problem with both 0.7 from market and also the sideloaded 1.0.  Android
v. 2.2 on Samsung Captivate.

Everytime I try to sync my deck it crashes while saying 'applying changes'.  I've tried
adding my deck both through USB and through Ankiweb, to get the same results.  Have
run a database check on the deck on my computer, didn't make a difference.  Attached
are the jsonObjectAndroid.txt and payloadAndroid.txt produced right after the crash.
 Let me know if I can get you anymore information to solve this.  If it helps to know,
my deck is large. Over 20,000 cards, and deck is over 70mb in size.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 763 Reported by Jesse:

Hey all,
I've been using ankidroid to practice Koine Greek and it requires the ancient diacritical
marks.  I use the rooted phone method to move the fonts.zip to my system/fonts folder
and the it was working great.
After the update [to 0.7] I have lost that support I tried selecting the different
fonts manually in preferences/other/default font, but that didnt' seem to make any
changes.  Any ideas?

I didn't make the deck myself, but it has been working with the rooted phone, custom
font thread that has been up for a few months.
Thanks,
Jesse 

I've tried the rooted method and the new custom font method and for some reason can't
figure out why I've lost the font support.  It seems pretty odd to me. 

Does anyone have any ideas of why I would lose font support after updating to 0.7?

1.with the new update to anki 0.7 on android, when i click on card browser, it does
NOT show all of the card, nor all of the answer compared to the version i had before.
as a result of not showing all on the screen, the search cannot search all of the card,
only what is shown on screen. meaning i cannot find anything meaningful because what
i want to search for is not entirely shown on the screen to be searched ! how do i
change it back to before ?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 774 I use animated GIF images to practice Japanese kanji stroke orders on my desktop Anki.
Ankidroid however does not play animated GIFs. Seeing as how it seems many versions
of Android do not support animated GIFs, I surmise that Ankidroid uses some image renderer
provided by the OS. In that case, maybe it is possible to render animated GIFs internally
instead?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 785 While sequence of characters can be easily selected and copied, the same cannot be said
for single characters, standalone or in compounds. While it's meaningless for western
languages, copying kanji with issue like that is impossible.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enter 'selection mode' (either by long-press or through menu)
2. Change selection range to fit one character
3. Try to click on it to copy

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Multiple characters selection is highlighted, while one-character is not (therefore
clicking on it does nothing).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 786 Not sure, if it's anki or aedict problem, but while most of the compounds are copied

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Copy random compound-word with some really frequent kanji in it (e.g., 小指)
2. Look it up in aedict

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Some of the kanji will not be copied 'as is', but will be replaced by 'rectangles'
(unknown symbols). Fore example, in case of 「小指」 it will be 「小] .

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 791 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card with any unicode character 0x12000 through 0x1236E (maybe others)
2. Set the display font to Assurbanipal
3. Install the font in /sdcard/AnkiDroid/fonts
4. Sync Deck
5. Review

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected output is the display of the cuneiform characters.  I do not see anything
instead (no boxes, diamods or anything just blank white space... this is different
if I don't set the font and it displays two diamonds with question marks in it).

I have verified that the custom font feature works (and I know how to make it work
on android) because I am able to change the font for my Hebrew deck (0x05b0-0x05ea).
 Also, I have changed the default font on my android device to be able to display the
cuneiform characters and as such I can see the proper characters in the card-browser
screen and the card-edit screen just NOT the card-review screen.  I can even view the
cards in the android web browser.

I've attached the deck and the font if you want to verify (the font is free oss)


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
AnkiDroid 0.7
Android 2.3.3
(2.6.37.4-cyanogenmod-01338-g0374804)

Maybe it is just the widget starting? Or is there something that starts even when no

Incredibly useful. Just one concern. Why does the service need to start at boot?

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 794 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create deck, and give it a whitespace in the name. Synchronize it with Anki web,
and upload a few media files to Dropbox.
2. Try synchronizing said files in AnkiDroid with &quot;Download Missing Files&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the media files to be synchronized, instead nothing gets downloaded. For decks
without whitespaces in their name, it synchronizes without problem, and if I try to
synchronize again, and no new files are found, I get &quot;No media files found missing&quot;.
On the other hand, with decks with whitespaces if I try synchronizing, I get &quot;Successfully
retrieved 0, missing 0&quot;, regardless of nothing getting synchronized. 

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
0.7, Gingerbread, Galaxy Tab, Overcome ROM.

In the Desktop version of Anki, you can replay the audio in the question even after
answering it, so that was the behavior I expected from AnkiDroid. I tried adding the
same audio to the question and the answer, but then in the Desktop version it would
play both of them whenever I hit the play button, so that's not an option.

Or we just load everything into the memory so that we only need to load once but not
everytime we open the Card Broswer. (Since many smartphone has huge memory)

just not synched and it can be easily fixed. Testing the issue on 1.0 will take more
time.

2. Press the sync button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
When logging into Ankiweb and starting to review the set it starts at the beginning
instead of the position it was saved on the phone. Apparently the progress was not
synced.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Android 2.3.3 Cyanogenmod 7, Ankidroid 0.7

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 849 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start Anki 1.0beta22 (or previous I guess, even if commit 90bca9287731e22597d31bf265168ae743667241
adds a call to waitToFinish() but in closeOpenedDeck(), which seems not to be called
here).
2. Immediately, during deck loading, press Back
3. The deadlock might or might not happen - I got once today a screen which was unresponsive
and completely black (i.e. empty, I'm using the Android Black theme).

I attached with the Eclipse debugger, and I performed a thread dump thread-by-thread.
No thread seemed to be doing anything, and the thread dump reveals a set of waiting
threads which seems to be a deadlock. A possible alternative is maybe that the thread
which was progressing just 

Noticeable calls relevant to the deadlock are in the first 4 threads and have to do
with decks, e.g. DeckPicker.waitForDeckLoaderThread(), DeckTask.waitToFinish() and
two DeckTask.doInBackground(DeckTask$TaskData...).

It's perfect !! especially Gestures.

but Anki for iPad have option for Repeat audio. - It's very useful.

I can't find option for repeat audio In Gestures Menu.


( I think that repeat audio button is too small - It's not good :-)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 861 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open AnkiDroid
2. Sync
3. The frozen screen

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
If I open AnkiDroid and tap to the sync button, I see &quot;the frozen&quot; screen with a menu
without any action. 
Sometimes the sync button gets red but screen is frozen. The same state is if I sync
all decks. Sometimes help if I press the back button, sometimes I see only a result
message after sync. 
I can see an Android message &quot;... wait or close application...&quot; very often.
Sometimes if I run the sync again, AnkiDroid told that there aren't any changes between
AnkiDroid and server. I think that AnkiDroid upload changes to the server without a
result message.

My typical work is:
- reviewing (on my way from or to work) - without an internet connection
- at work or at home run AnkiDroid and start Sync 

If I sync my deck after a review, it is OK.

The problem started when I opened a deck for reviewing. After review of the first card,
the program crashed. I tried many times again, and eventually decided to reinstall,
but it still crashed, even in newer versions (1.0alphas). So I deleted the ankidroid
folder from the Sdcard and reinstall again, but now the folder even can't create, so
i Can't open the sample deck (when I try, it writes &quot;No decks found), Can't download
my personal deck. I tried also to create &quot;AnkiDroid&quot; folder manually and to copy anki
file I exported, but seems it doesn't identify anything. 

Please Help Me!

And sorry about my english. I need the software to improve it ;-)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 876 Hello,

Thank you so much for working on ankidroid and helping the community. Here is my issue.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Download the public kanji deck &quot;RTK-Ultima&quot;, or any other deck &gt;25MB

2. Open up the deck and start the review of cards

3. When progressing to the next card, it takes about 2 seconds to load (regardless
of phone, CPU (i tried this on my android, and my freind on his galaxy 2 1.5ghz phone,
same delay). Ankidroid is slow for progressing to the next card, while Anki on iphone
is normal speed for this deck.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Cards are much slower on ankidroid versus Anki Desktop or Anki Iphone Versions.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
Im using the latest 1.0beta36.apk. Ive also tested this on 1.0beta35,34,33 and 0.7beta.



Please provide any additional information below.

Thank you for your guidance. This is not specific to the RTK large decks, but rather
any large deck ( I think as it gets &gt;25MB or so).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 877 What steps will reproduce the problem?
01. Open Anki on Windows 7
02. Set DropBox as media holder
03. Make a new deck: Elemi függvények deriváltja
04. Add a new chard
      * Front: [$]\text{tg }x[/$]
      * Back: [$]{1 \over \text{cos}^2 x}[/$]
05. Save
06. Set deck to sync with AnkiWeb
07. Close deck (now syncing again the app)

08. Open AnkiDroid on my Android
09. Download the &quot;Elemi függvények deriváltja&quot; deck
10. Open it and start practice
11. The equitation was not shown, only a frame


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
 * Shown the correct format of equitation like on desktop Anki

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
 * AnkiDroid v1.0
 * Anki for Windows v1.2.8

Please provide any additional information below.
 * My Dropbox folder contains the requested files
       Dropbox\Public\Anki\Elemi függvények deriváltja.media\
         latex-168d0ab137ce0839798fd5e38403b3e4.png
         latex-207d1cf61e201cf9205670cd10919593.png
 * If I longpress on deck and select &quot;Downloading missing media&quot; item then it say:
&quot;Successfully retrived 0, missing 0&quot;
 * Not exists the &quot;/sdcard/AnkiDroid/Elemi függvények deriváltja.media&quot; folder
 * If I try to repair or anything else then it will not be fixed.
 * I checked the .anki file with an SQLIte browser. It contain correct Dropbox URL
and correct filename.

* If my deck's name is &quot;Elemi fuggvenyek derivaltja&quot; (it's contain only English chars)
then the equitation will not shown BUT the frame contains a question mark
    * Now exists the &quot;/sdcard/AnkiDroid/Elemi fuggvenyek derivaltja.media&quot; folder (note:
without hungarian letters) but it's empty
    * The &quot;Downloading missing media&quot; can't fixing this problem too

I attached the .anki file

Actually one of my deck (11M in size) is very vulnerable in ankidroid. It crashes frequently,
but when I send the stacktrace back to you guys, it just complaints there is no connection,
however the device do connects with the internet, WIFI or 3G.

I want to know why the deck is so vulnerable. Thanks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 883 Hey,

referring to this issue: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=477 we
were asked to post some recognized problems.

First of all, I like your work and the possibility to have Arabic flash-cards, but
I still found some small issues. One letter, the 'hamza', is missing. For example the
word &quot;water&quot; should look like this: ماء but instead you sea: ما

There is no reshaping/concatenation for hyphens. There are used to show some more space
between letters without loosing concatenation of the whole word.

Have a nice day

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 901 First off, thanks for AnkiDroid!

I'd like to provide a little patch:
When reviewing cards in the train/etc the need to pause your learning and resume at
a later point comes up often. As (on low-memory devices) closing and restarting the
app later didn't work nicely i've wrote a little patch that'll let you &quot;pause&quot; a session.

I hope i've done this more or less correct in the respective environment ... sorry
if not!


Secondly i've noticed that alpha15 (12d6c68e3ac143dd62f4659f29c73b6b233acac6) tends
to crash when i (from the studyoptions activity) go back to the launcher (home button),
do something, maybe let some &quot;memory cleaner&quot; app clean the memory, then re-open aniki
i've experienced crashes with:
java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{com.ichi2.anki/com.ichi2.anki.StudyOptions}:
java.lang.NullPointerException
[...]
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.ichi2.anki.StudyOptions.onPrepareDialog(StudyOptions.java:1724)

I've also tried to fix that (it does work for me, nothing else stopped working, but
i'm quite sure its the wrong way i did it...).

My changes can be pulled from http://dyn.kanojo.de/~daddel9/ankidroid-patch-git/ .

Thanks again for the great project, regards
- Dario Ernst

PS: Please, close/delete Issue 900 - i've accidentially hit enter and there seems to
be no way to delete the issue ... ;/

If I do not know how to read correct a word. I would to use TTS.

But it would be good if I can use for Ankidroid a own language.

I use TTS German to read my epubs.

But I need TTS for Ankidroid only for English.

So it would be hard to change the TTS on the android system every time I want to lern.

or is there an app to change fast the TTS. That would be enough.

I tried them on a fake apad (wm8505 300mhz processor) and it ran. I tried a lcd resolution

I hope that future ankidroid versions will work with low resolution such as samsung

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 929 for all of my decks (4 of them), after reviewing all cards for a given day
the deck picker shows 1 card is still due (see Deck_Picker.png). However the
deck itself indicates all cards are actually reviewed, and so does the
widget.

I also noticed that the greeting message after review is over is weird (see
End_Review.png): the message in the screenshot is in French but looks like
&quot;Tomorrow there will be 59 cards to review and 1 card.&quot; Seems to me like a
word is missing somewhere, possibly indicating something else went wrong.

With AnkiDroid 1.0 and Android 2.3, there was no issue. The issue appeared
when upgrading to ICS (still with AnkiDroid 1.0) and is still there with the
latest beta (on ICS).

1. Install Anki from Amazon marketplace on Kindle fire, and download a Japanese deck
(All I've tried so far. Same results on 6 different decks though, thought I wasn't
checking for this bug or anything, just pointing it out).
2. Interacting with the screen and the card, which I assume normally writes on the
whiteboard does nothing.
3. Similarly, you can pull up a menu while you're studying a deck, and see the options
such as clear whiteboard, but you cannot interact with any of the buttons.

This is on version 0.5.1 as downloaded from the Amazon marketplace for the kindle fire.

On Android 1.5, when trying to add new cards, the keyboard always defaults to capital

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 949 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. First copy than using the media files from the desktop decks on Ankidroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Sound files playing with normal speed


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?
1.1beta2 on MIUI Android 2.3.7 (1.0 stable version had the same problem on y phone)


Please provide any additional information below.
The speed anki is playing the ogg-files is double or three times faster than normal.
In standard media player the speed is normal.
If there is a lot of audio files (actually some cards have sentences and up to 10 or
more audio files) the audio is playing without recogniseable order.
Sounds like some played at once.

I added to sound files. One recorded on the phone (soundtoofast) and one made with
audacity using the original file in the anki deck. Actually Anki desktop itself plays
it even slower, than audacity, so I have three different speeds. The Anki desktop version
is fitting my needs on the desktop, original files played with audacity is slightly
to fast for my taste and ankidroid playing it on the phone is unusable but I didn't
manage it to record it

However, Ankidroid is a great program!

The application AnkiDroid (process com.ichi2.anki) has stopped
unexpectedly. Please try again.

Trying to sync. It tells me there are changes local and remote (which is strange because
I haven't modified the remote), asks
which to keep. I select keep local and it crashes.

Happens everytime.

I'm running on a rooted Kindle Fire 6.2.1. Not sure how to tell what version of AnkiDroid.

Thanks!

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 958 Hi, thank you for creating AnkiDroid. It is of really big use for me :)

Recently I renamed my decks to be prepared for Anki 2, now I am having trouble viewing
them related to the &quot;::&quot; inside the decks name. Also there seems to be a problem with
syncing.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create deck or rename it with name abc::def gh::ijkl
2. Download it with anki

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected: Name for deck would be abc::def gh::ijkl
Is: abcdef ghijkl (ghijkl might disappear if abcdef takes too much space)

Syncing-expected: deck is synced with correct name.
Syncing-is: deck is uploaded with wrong name.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? On what version of Android?

1.1beta5


Thank you very much for your work.

Best regards

Jonas

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 961 In the last beta versions I don't see a menu option at all when using AnkiDroid in my
tablet.

The top bar that shows the name of the deck has gotten smaller. In the tablets, that
where the menu button goes, but now it has disappeared.

The change seems to be because of: e50cd84 - Added Google translate filter !
I guess it does some layout changes too, applying Holo theme to Android versions API
11 and higher.

As far as I know Holo theme is the Ice Cream Sandwich default theme, which should be
compatible with API versions 14 and up (11 and 12 being Honeycomb).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 966 When android is connected to internet via laptop (tethering) everything works just fine
except ankidroid:
got error message &quot;no internet connection&quot;.

I guess there is some stupid check for internet connection instead of actual connection
routine. This retarded check should be removed (or made optional if there is actually
some scenario when it could be useful).

Related bug - when this check fails ankidroid do not save login and password. This
is beyond stupidity: if user have entered some information it has to be saved regardless
of any kind of stupid checks. Always, I mean _always_ consider information entered
by user as highly valuable - don't just dump it becaue of some retarded useless check
has failed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 967 What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

After installing Anki 1.1 beta 5 on my Motorola Xoom MZ-601 (Honeycomb 3.2) the Notification
area didn't show anything but the clock-battery-network icons. Usually it shows information
from installed apps down there - such as System Monitor, Sipdroid status and Easy Battery
Saver.
Restarting apps/rebooting the Tablet has no effect - the notifications won't show up
as usual.

Additionally in Anki I can't access any settings, it always opens the last deck I had
open before upgrading, no way out.

Anyway, thanks for the great work so far,
Kashi K.

Specs:
AnkiDroid 1.1beta9
Acer Iconia A500
Honeycomb 3.2.1

Steps:
Go to review flashcards.
Click on right-most button on top
Bar should disappear for remainder of time reviewing.
Bar reappears if you go back to the menu or deck screen.

Took a couple photos (attached) to demonstrate issue.

Couldn't find any issues open for this, hopefully it isn't a duplicate. Thanks!

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Everytime, I had to uninstall and install the current market version and refuse the
beta update

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
I think it is 1.1 or 1.5. (I've taken it off now) the beta version it asks you to update
to.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 974 By flofly:

Recently ankidroid is not able to load my deck (attached) anymore, it is a quiet
big deck with Chinese characters and audiofiles. Opening of the deck
works however as soon as I want to start learning or show the cards of
the desk ankidroid crashes. When restarting it tells me that the file
is in a wrong format. Ankidroid is not able to repair it.

On the desktop version on Linux and Windows there is no problem with
the deck.

Is there any possibility I can check the deck for possible errors or
get an more detailed error message of ankidroid?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 979 By BodeyBaker:

I had a really odd issue the other day that could be related [to issue #380].

I was on a plane, put the phone into aeroplane mode, turned it off, and at the allowed
time, turned it on to fill my time with anki reviews. They were all listed as 0 reviews
due. This was clearly odd. I tried turning aeroplane mode off and taking out my sim
card to see if it was related to that. No dice. Then I put in my sim card. Still no
change. So I put it back on aeroplane mode and turned it off. When we landed, I turned
on the phone and the reviews were there. I'd say this sounds more like someone scared
witchcraft than a real bug report, but then the same thing happened on the return flight.
Any ideas?

This was clearly odd. = This was clearly wrong.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 982 Pressing show answer causes the display of the other side of the card to be from the
bottom when it takes up more than the screen can show. Previously the behaviour was
to line the top of the card up with the top of the screen. I'd argue that behaviour
is better but really it's beside the point. The more important problem is that there
doesn't appear to be an option to change this in the Display options.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 984 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. create a card and insert an image
2. mess with the filepath of the image (image already existing, anki appends (1) to
filename, remove the original file and rename the duplicate, sync, try to add the image
back)
3. remove the image from the card
4. sync
5. try to add the image back to the card

The image should be displayed in the add card interface.
But all i get is a file icon.

if i rename the picture, same empty file icon.
if i move the picture and change filepath, same empty file icon

the only way to fix this is to EDIT the image and change a few pixels.

As if anki kept a hash of the picture even after the card has been edited and saved
to remove any reference to that picture.

using latest stable release for windows.

2. Attempt to download missing media
3. Attempt to review 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

An error message pops up if you attempt to download missing media; no images are displayed
if you review the deck

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

yes


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

AnkiDroid v1.0

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

2.3.5, Samsung Galaxy Gio


Please provide any additional information below.

Creating the directories in the deck's media folder (mydeck.media/maps/european_captials
in this case) resolved the issue

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1007 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Add a card from cellphone and sync the deck to desktop Anki
2. Perform a search from Anki

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- The card cannot be found. It's still there when you review the deck, but it just
cannot be found through searching

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
- It can be reproduced every time but with following exceptions:
1. After you edit the card on Anki, it can be found again
2. I've only tested this on a Chinese system with cards containing Chinese characters

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)
- Tried it on v1.0 and v1.1beta12

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1013 This is related to http://code.google.com/p/anki/issues/detail?id=2928 .

I don't have a way to repro but maybe someone who knows the code will easily think
why this happened.

I have a deck that I use only the phone but edit on the desktop. I suspended a card
on the phone. After unsuspending on the desktop, it was in an inconsistent state that
made it show over and over (see the bug above for more info).

Looking at an old back from before it was suspended I see

sqlite&gt; select type, relativeDelay, priority, successive from cards where question
like &quot;%control%&quot;;
1|1|2|8

which is all good.

Looking at the old backup on my phone I see


sqlite&gt; select type, relativeDelay, priority, successive from cards where question
like &quot;%control%&quot;;
1|0|-3|8

I think this is incorrect because when anki desktop unsuspends a card, it sets type=relativeDelay
(decks.py:unsuspendCards). That gives the card a type=0 (which indicates a fail) but
successive=8 (which indicates correct 8 times in a row).

I don't know how the 0 vs 8 happened. It probably involved me doing

1 fail card
2 undo fail so I can
3 suspend card

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1018 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Complete all the reviews due for the day in one deck.
2. Exit out of Ankidroid.
3. Enter Ankidroid again.
4. Click the 'Start Reviewing' button on that same deck, anticipating the 'Reviews
completed' menu to appear (Review early, learn more etc.)
5. Ankidroid crashes.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
'Reviews completed' menu should appear, but instead I get the 'Force Close' screen.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Everytime.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1019 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open up a deck (the one I used has limit options already set)
2. Hit the 'limit' button above cram
3. The tag selection dialog opens up under the limit dialog, so when trying to change
tags for the checkboxes, the dialog fails to open.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I was expecting the dialog to be hidden until I tried to select different tags, and
for it to appear above the limit learning dialog.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

If I close the limit learning dialog, then I can close the tag selection dialog under
it. Then if I hit the limit button again, everything works as you'd expect.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1029 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. study with ankidroid 2 (up to alpha13)
2. copy collection files to anki desktop (I don't have wifi for cloud syncing)
3. open anki 2 desktop

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
expected = same schedule as that in ankidroid 2
instead = the schedule has not changed at all, in ankidroid I have already done 2 weeks
of studying, in anki2 desktop my schedule is still is stuck in day1. 


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
happens everytime

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

ankidroid 2 alpha upto13

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
I tried copying the file from desktop to my smartphone (I just opened the collection
in the desktop to see schedule without doing any studying) and the schedule is fine
on ankidroid, I tried copying the same collection to another android device and the
schedule is fine, the problem is only when I open it on the desktop anki2.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1030 After I updated my Asus Transformer to Android 4.0.3 I encountered a few Problems:

1. The buttons on the right top side (back, erase drawings, options, etc.) most of
the time don't show up when reviewing cards. A few times they were visible, but then
the remaining cards area on the upper left side disappeared (happened only a few times).


2. When drawing on the screen the programm lags sometimes. The lines don't show up
for about a second and then suddenly pop up.

3. Anki lags sometimes when pushing some buttons like &quot;show answer&quot;. 


Android Version: 1.0

There is a circular button in the field box on the right that appears to create a strikethrough

2. Download deck to Ankidroid.

You would expect the deck to sync across the board, but because Ankidroid does not
support the apostrophe, it creates additional deck on the site.

Every single time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1052 When in cram mode, the session limits for reviews are applied, thus stopping after the

I assume this is an unwanted behaviour, since it's inconsistent with the desktop version
of Anki. If not, AnkiDroid should not disable the 'limit' button.

This was tested using AnkiDroid 1.1.

Most times. This used to happen before the update as well, but usually only once. If
you tried to open the deck a second time it would always work. Now the deck picker
reloading when selecting a deck often happens multiple times in a row, which is somewhat
annoying.

I know that this behavior is intended, but it's anoying. I review three decks every

for some cards I have an answer specified and for other cards not.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1064 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Stepping into Card Browser
2.Pressing Add in order to Add new card, completing it and pressing add button
3.Stepping back to the Card Browser

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: The new item is added to the list
Experienced: The list is not updated. You have to leave Card Browser, step back into
it and then you can see the updated list.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

AnkiDroid v1.1

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

2.3.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1066 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.You add new card and fill front and back sides and save it
2.Start reviewing
3.On the added card the back side became the question and the front is the answer 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
EXPECTED: The front is the question and the back is the answer. 
EXPERIENCED: The back is the question, and the front is the answer. So I have to cut
and paste to settle it. I did not use the swap Q/A feature at all. Sometimes the card
is inserted properly but most of the time it swapped. If this swap would be changeless
than I would get used to the fact that the back is the question but than again the
back is the answer and I have to copy and past (since the questions are on the back
of most of my cards already). 
I also experienced a strange behavior with previous version (AnkiDroid-1.0alpha3.apk):
the card is mixed up and I edit only one character and after saving it the problem
is solved. Unfortunately it does not always work so I have to use cut/paste again.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Using certain deck the problem is absolutely reproducible, but when I create a new
deck then everything is fine. Therefore I think this issue is probably card related.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1082 First of all I want to thank you for the great work on ankidroid 2.0, can't wait for
it to be officially released :) I am using it both on samsung galaxy i5500 and coby
kyros 7016. Regarding the syncing, I find that copying the anki2 files to the mydocuments&gt;anki&gt;user1
folder works instead of placing it on mydocuments&gt;anki alone, though I have not tried
synching it on the cloud.

However here are a couple of issues I found with the latest release:

1) notes that have the words whites or blacks are displayed as codes such as #000000
or #ffffff (ie &quot;White patients are more prone to...&quot; is displayed as &quot;#ffffff patients
are more prone to....&quot;

2) version16 won't install if I have a previous ankidroid2.0 on my gadget (I used version
14 before), I have to uninstall the old version before the new version can be installed

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1083 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a desk and format single words with a color. This will show as hex-code in
the html command
2. Export the desk (via sync or manually copy/paste) to ankidroid. The fonts display
in standard color only.
3. When formatting the text in plain-text colors (lightblue, purple, green etc.) in
ankidroid, this will display correctly.
4. But when exporting desks from desktop to ankidroid, color formats (entered in plain-text
in desktop version) will change to hex-code and again display in standard color.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the text to display in the color I chose in anki desktop.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes, it happens every time. Ankidroid seems to correct plain-text color commands correctly,
but not hex-code colors.


AnkiDroid v1.1
Android 2.3.5


Please either make export of plain-text colors from desktop to ankidroid possible,
or allow ankidroid to read hex-code colors and display correctly. thanks very much!

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Crashed

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It happenes evey time
What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

Alpha 1-21
If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1104 Hi,

I have a very strange error in Ankidroid that I really don't understand.  When I edit
the keyword in my &quot;Kanji - Jap&quot; deck, the card somehow becomes associated with the
wrong template.  These are the precise steps to replicate - 

In Ankidroid - 

1. Open Kanji - Jap deck
2. Start the review
3. Select Edit card from Menu
4. Make any change to the keyword property
5. Save changes
6. You will be taken back to the review session, but the card will have flipped sides
and will be using the template from the &quot;Kanji - Eng&quot; deck (presumably)

The only way I have found to fix this card at this point is to
1. Load the card in Windows Anki.
2. Edit the keyword and save
3. The card will flip back to the correct template.

I have uploaded the two decks (the only two decks I have loaded into Ankidroid).  If
you view the Kanji - Jap deck and have a look at the card with the keyword of &quot;tranquillizes&quot;
you can observe that this card is flipped around the wrong way from the rest of the
card.  This is because I edited the Keyword in Ankidroid as above.

I am surprised this has not been picked up before because it seems a serious error,
which makes me think it is just me.  It has occured for me since I started using Ankidroid,
and as a result I only can edit cards using Anki.

My specs 
Samsung Galaxy S2
Stock ROM LA4 
Rooted 
Ankidroid 1.1
Android 2.3.6

Good luck with this one and thanks for your assistance!

Regards,
Lloyd

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1105 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. In deck preferences click &quot;new Cards&quot; then &quot;Steps in minutes&quot;
2. Give in a few intervals, like &quot;1 15 60 120&quot; for example
3. During study in a few minutes a card can progress through well beyond its timing.

In my opinion with respect to efficiency and time saving it would be better if these
timing periods would be kept literally. If I click on &quot;30 minutes&quot; I should see that
card in 30 minutes.

Please provide any additional information below.

Just upgraded both the alpha version and the new anki beta 4 version. I was already
having trouble with syncing from ankidroid prior to updating either, and often it would
simply be in the middle of syncing and crash. I already submitted the error log code
for that instance before. Also, I'm positive it's not the updated beta version of full
Anki because I updated ankidroid prior to updating Anki and that is when the problem
first started. I had hoped updating Anki might solve the issue.

Also, on a side not, the Night mode does not work anymore either.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1116 These steps will reproduce the problem:
1.Create a deck with a long name (&gt; 40 char)through the desktop app or some other means.
The cutoff in the Linux Desktop app appears to be 130 while the Windows Desktop app
only allows for 50 characters.
2.Sync the deck to ankidroid
3.Add a card
4.Sync again

Expected a normal sync of any changes made to the deck. Instead Ankidroid seems to
truncate the deck name, the new shorter name does not match the one stored at ankiweb
so when it syncs it does so as a new deck.

Originally I discovered this with a deck named &quot;Electronic Devices and Circuits Vol
1 chp 2&quot; I confirmed it using one named &quot;01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789&quot;

I have version 1.1 of AnkiDroid which I just installed a few days ago from Google Play.

I am using Android 2.3.5 on a Samsung Statosphere model SCH-I405.

This is not a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; type problem.

This is all the information I can think to send.  Thanks!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1118 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open &quot;add card&quot; dialogue.
2. Put your phone in landscape mode so that the keyboard uses the entire screen.
3. After typing into the first field, press &quot;next&quot; on the on screen keyboard.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The cursor should jump to the next field. Instead, nothing happens. This is really
inconvenient if you add a card in landscape mode and the keyboard uses the entire screen,
because you always have to press the back key to close the keyboard and then go to
the next field manually.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 
Ankidroid 1.1

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1119 I have a deck with the following fields:

1. French
2. German
3. Audio

Then I created three templates like this:

1.
{{French}}
--
{{German}}
{{Audio}}

2.
{{German}}
--
{{French}}
{{Audio}}

3.
{{Audio}}
--
{{French}}
{{German}}


The first two cards will always be created, because you usually always type in the
German and French fields. But the Audio field is sometimes empty.
Anki Desktop only creates a card if the question field is not empty. So in this case,
if Audio is empty, only two cards are created.

It would be really nice if Ankidroid could do this, too. You can deselect the third
templates, but you forget this sometimes or rather you forget to activate it again
(and then you wonder why you don't have the third card anymore). 

I guess it would be quite easy: Just check if the front page of a card/template is
empty, and if yes, don't create that particular card.

1. I click on &quot;start review&quot; and the screen blinks shortly than throws me back on the

It happens every time. The last time Ankidroid worked for me was version &quot;Alpha 16&quot;.
(Back than even &quot;night mode&quot; worked fine. But it's downhill ever since.)

Incidentally, I use it on &quot;s. Galaxy S Plus&quot;

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1126 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start AnkiDroid, which is a new install, without _any_ existing decks
2. Download deck-&gt;Shared deck 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see a form to pick up a new deck. I get error:
&quot;Attention! A network error has occurred. Retry, or cancel and return to the previous
screen.&quot;

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens every time. Selecting &quot;Retry&quot; gets me the same message.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
I'm using AnkiDroid v1.1.1 on a horrible abomination of ICS 4.0.3 done by Samsung,
on Samsung Galaxy SII. My phone is rooted.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
On my previous phone (also Samsung Galaxy SII, running the latest CM9), previous version
of AnkiDroid worked fine. However, that phone was stolen, and in the meantime this
new version arrived, but I don't know if this matters.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1136 If the user has no widgets and notifications set to never, AnkiDroid should not be running.
While it is up to the OS whether to stop the application or not, we should make sure
we do not keep it running longer than we need to.
For example, we should disable the BOOT_COMPLETED receiver if notifications are set
to never.
Moreover, we should not started the service to update the widget if there is no widget.

Desktop: windows version of Anki2 beta 9

Problems: (alpha28)
1.) It is still displayed as alpha27
2.) night mode still does not work
3.) cloze made with the new anki2 beta works intermittently; ie I open a deck, it shows
a couple of questions, but goes back to the deck screen. for some decks it won't even
start the learning process at all
4.) I sync my deck by copying via usb; the dates don't update at all. ie I made changes
via desktop at 12nn, I then studied at 4pm using my tablet, but the time doesn't update,
so when I copy the deck back to the desktop or other android devices the date/time
is still stuck at 12nn, instead of 4pm

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1139 AnkiDroid defaults to disabling type in the answer by default, even if it's on in the
desktop, which has resulted in a number of posts on the forums and this issue tracker
from people who didn't know how to enable it. While I personally hate typing on touchscreen
keyboards, I think typing the answer should be on by default if the user has enabled
it in their desktop reviews.

Every time. I recently updated to Android 4.0 and was quite surprised the UI looks

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1152 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. preferences, extras, play sounds instantly, text to speech
2. start reviewing
3. error box : no text to speech language available, press ok
4. show answer, dialog box to select language appear and text-to-speech is now working
but I cannot press play button, thus I cannot repeat text-to-speech. Then select answer
and go to next question.
5. now dialog box to select language appears, and TTS for question card is now working,
but I can't press the play button again.
6. This error appear for all decks.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
In my old HTC desire, this feature is working fine; I can activate TTS in question
and answer card and can press the play button to repeat the speech. But in my HTC One
X, the TTS service sometimes doesn't work in the first card (no sound) and working
fine in subsequent card, but I cannot press the play button to repeat the speech in
all cards and all decks.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happen all the time.

Clicking on &quot;Start Review&quot; always throws back to the same screen.
It was already an issue a couple of versions earlier (alpha17-2x) then you fixed it
and now the same bug's popped up in Alpha 33.
Had to revert to Alpha 32.

I'm gonna try to use your suggested &quot;sendlog&quot; app.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1155 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open google translate
2. Get a translation
3. Press menu -&gt; send -&gt; ankidroid, ankidroid launches
4. The card contains information in the wrong fields


I would expect to see language 1 in field 1 and language 2 ( the translation ) in field
two
Instead I see 

Message traduit par Google Traduction in field 1

 and

 Traduction automatique (français) :
ce qui est mal avec ce soft.

Texte original (anglais) :
what is wrong with this app.


...  In field 2

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

The issue happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

Version 1.1 from market
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

3.2 


Please provide any additional information below.

I am not sure of anything else that will help. I am currently familiarizing myself

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1159 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Study deck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

When studying deck ( cards), back to study option.
So I can't study card.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

30-40% on studying card.
but 10-13 cards -&gt; every time back to study option.

AnkiDroid-1.1.2.apk 

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

I uses this android machine.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1163 ## What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install my shared deck 9fe67737c7a5a5a2 (which includes some audio and text from
www.book2.de)
2. Try to review it in Ankidroid v1.1.2 on a Pulse Mini running Android 2.1-update1

## What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect the first card's question to speak the following using audio, &quot;Arabic واحد
(in a male voice) واحد (in a female voice) in Bengali&quot; and to display the following
text: &quot;Arabic: ‪]‬واحد‪[‬ 1 In Bengali ...&quot;

Instead, no audio plays at all, and of the text, only the bits in English are displayed,
plus the text &quot;sound:ar0001.mp3&quot; and some square brackets and some little black-bordered
white rectangles.

## Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

## What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1164 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review with Ankidroid
2. Occasionally deck will break.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect reviewing to happen regularly.  Sometimes The deck will get in such a state
where I can answer a card and that same card will come up again. I can answer it again
and it comes up again.  This repeats forever.  If I try to open the same deck on anki
desktop, it gives a message  that shows it is corrupt (error dialog attached).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?  Not sure what causes it.  It happens sporadically.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

A deck in the broken state is available here:

Windows error message when trying to open linked file is attached as screenshot.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1177 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1.Open the deck

2.Do a few reviews

3.As usual, click any of the four buttons in order to finish current card and proceed

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected: The program properly goes to the next card and keep working

Instead: As normal, the clicked button is highlighted while others are darkened. However
the program would not proceed. Instead it just stucks at the same card interface. Clicking
menu or back etc. won't help. From the task manager it is seen that the RAM usage of
Ankidroid doesn't change much(fluctuates around 0.x MBs). Occasionally(not in all cases)
a window pops out, saying &quot;Activity Reviewer is not responding, Force Close/Wait&quot;.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens every six to seven cards or so.

I figure it's just the same as Issue 277: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=277,
which was already declared as &quot;FixedInDev&quot; in version 0.6. However, it reappeared...

I'm learning in one direction with a deck of approximately 1500 words presently. Deck
created and modified only on PC.

** I don't have an &quot;Android Version&quot;, only a &quot;System Version&quot; (Blur_Version.0.40.0.MB502.Brasil.en.BR)
and a &quot;Firmware Version&quot; (2.1-update 1) and a &quot;Build Number&quot; (BASLA-U3_00.40.0.)

That does explain why I've been seeing Portugese words :-)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1180 This affects Egyptian hieroglyphics. It might also affect some CJK characters on the
Supplementary Ideographic Plane, including some in modern use, but I haven't verified
that.

What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Install AnkiDroid 1.1.2 and Linux Anki 1.2.5. (I have no reason to believe that
the specific version numbers or the desktop OS affect this.)
2. Download the Aegyptus font package from http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ and install
Gardiner.ttf in /sdcard/AnkiDroid/fonts and on the desktop.
3. On the desktop, edit a card model to use the &quot;Gardiner&quot; font a specific field, and
insert U+1300 (a seated man). You can copy and paste from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs#Unicode
4. Sink everything to AnkiWeb, and notice that it works fine from a desktop browser.
5. Sink everything down to AnkiDroid and review the card containing U+1300.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

You should see the same hieroglyphic character that you see in Anki desktop and AnkiWeb.
Instead, you see six black diamonds containing a question mark and the hexidecimal
number &quot;FFFD&quot;.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

AnkiDroid 1.1.2

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

4.0.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

Thank you for such an excellent program!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1184 If you open the attached example deck (or another deck with a high res image) on your
phone, then you should notice the image is not scaled to suit the screen size, and
I need to pan to see the whole image. The same image is correctly scaled in ankidroid
1.

Also notice that the furigana is not displayed correctly on the answer side of the
card (it just shows gibberish). I suspect you already know about this problem so I
haven't submitted a separate error report.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1186 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Using the program :)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Before the upgrade to 4.0 on my phone, the buttons were nice and minimal. Now the answer
buttons, etc are HUGE taking up nearly 1/3 of my viewable area. They're so huge that
when using landscape mode the interface blocks most of the text. There is also now
the title of the deck and a forward and back button that wasn't there before. Basically
the whole interface is huge and cluttered suddenly.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens all the time, doesn't seem to be an option to make it any smaller as it's at
100% and can't go lower.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

AnkiDroid 1.1.3, Android 4.0.3

Please provide any additional information below.
The option to reduce the button size to below 100% would be great, and/or to minimalize
the interface since phones are a small device.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

You should get nicely displayed furigana over the kanji, instead it shows numbers 1,
2, 3 randomly for both the kanji and the furigana.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

cards list which is coloured in Card Browser (even there's option &quot;Show marked cards&quot;)
BUT this information about marked cards IS NOT SYNCING with &quot;Big&quot; Anki (v1.2.8).

The same is in the second way: marked cards in &quot;Big&quot; Anki are not synced and seen in
AnkiDroid.

As of Alpha 49, pictures are scaled down but there it is a few millimeters short of
what it should be. It's as if the program routine does not account for the MARGIN of
the screen , only the screen size.

Everytime. Only way to avoid the issue is to uninstall Ankidroid 1.1.3. This is immensely

No new cards are pulled in to replace the suspended ones. So if I have a limit of 20
new cards and suspend 5 during the review, no additional 5 cards are added to the queue
to make up for it. Going back to the Deck Picker correctly fills the queue again and
I can re-enter the deck and study the 5 missing cards.

AnkiDroid 1 correctly refilled the queue on the spot.

The summary beside Deck1 should show (5 6 8), but it shows (10 12 16) instead, apparently
summing up values for Deck3, Deck4 AND Deck2, thus doubling real quantity of cards.
This is an example pattern. If there is a deck at level Deck2, same applies to it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1221 due to interdependencies with widget updating, the col fails sometimes to load when
ankidroid is started. this happens when widget and normal collection loading occurs
at the same time.

The widget checks if the collection is already open. If not, it opens the collection
and closes it after having fetched the information.

When the widget opens the collection before the normal col loading start, deckpicker
will just take the already opened collection and mark it as opened in order to prevent
the widget from closing it.

That's the basic idea, but sometimes the widget nevertheless closes the collection
although it's requested by deckpicker. In this case, deckpicker reports a db error.

The open collection method is a static synchronized method.

Any guess, why this happens? We should definitely solve this before releasing as it
tells users about corrupt dbs which are actually not.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1226 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have a deck in previous stable version of ankidroid with pictures in it. (Ultimate
Geography chosen here)
2. Upgrade to AnkiDroid2.0beta4
3. Browse the particular deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I should see pictures. I see the question mark, which was shown, when no media folder
for the deck was in previous version. I assume it's because the new collection file.
It probably did not upload the pictures. However I need them and there either is a
way how to do this (couldn't find any manual or something), or this is &quot;under construction&quot;.
If so, than I'll have to revert changes, I think, until this is fixed.

I also thought of downloading Anki Desktop 2.0 mentioned on the start of beta and see
if it would create a media file or folder on it's own, which I would copy then. Either
no such application exist (yet), or I'm kinda blind - couldn't find any.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Didn't try it again, I'm pretty sure it would happen again.

Please provide any additional information below.
Downloading personal or shared decks is the only sane way to get Anki decks on the
Nexus 7. Unfortunately, the device does not register itself as a mass storage device,
so it's tricky to get the decks onto it. I used a Dropbox workaround, but this is probably
too involved for beginners. I know you guys are concentrating on AnkiDroid 2 right
now, but the Nexus 7 is an incredible device for ankiholics and finally shipping in
large quantities.

The correct number of due cards.

The problem occurred twice so far while testing. I haven't imported any other decks
yet, so the tutorial deck is the only one affected (the Default deck doesn't have cards).

Repairing the deck doesn't help. After doing some reviews, it will switch back to the
right number.
Any idea how to reproduce this?

5. Click on &quot;Start reviewing&quot;
6. After clicking on &quot;Show answer&quot;, select &quot;Good&quot;
7. The card will be shown again (cards to review: 1)
8. After doing the card again, it will show the Congratulations screen

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The review should be over after step 6. The answered card should be in the next day's
session.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
2.0 beta 4

On what version of Android?
4.1.1

Please provide any additional information below.
Maybe things changed in Anki 2, but this seems fishy to me.

			<bugID>Issue #2137</bugID>
			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1235 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review one deck on AnkiDroid with a wide screen, such as a tablet, sync.
2. Sync on another system. Review another deck, sync again.
3. Sync on the AnkiDroid device again.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The deck highlighted in the list on the left and the one shown in the overview on the
right should be the same.
Instead in the list the last deck active on the remote system is highlighted, on the
right the last deck you reviewed on this device is shown.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
AnkiDroid 2.0.beta6 on Android 4.0.3.

For extra nastiness, when you delete the deck on the other system, the right side shows
a non-existent deck after the sync. (For this you may have to force a full sync on
the remote system.)
Pressing &quot;Start Reviewing&quot; in this situation crashes AnkiDroid.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1236 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Outside of AnkiDroid, create a deck with an interrobang[1] (“‽”) in it. 
2. Sync this from AnkiDroid

The interrobang shouldd appear in the deck name.
Instead nothing (left) or a little box (right) appears.

I know this is rather low priority and not so much a problem of AnkiDroid, but this
box did appear in my issue report 1235, so i thought i’d mention it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1242 What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
AnkiDroid v2.0beta6

On what version of Android?
2.2 and 4.1 (emulator)


Any elements that have been given a font-size style do not scale if using &quot;em&quot; as the
unit.
E.g,. 
.card
{
  font-size: 2em;
}

On the desktop client, the fonts in the card are scaled accordingly. On AnkiDroid,
they do not scale. Changing the &quot;Relative font size&quot; has no effect on the text size,
whether it's 10% or 150%.

Using pixels instead does indeed scale the text. I.e., the following does get scaled:
.card
{
  font-size: 25px;
}

The issue is present in cards where the usage of px and em is intermixed among different
elements, where those that use px are scaled, and those that use em are not.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1247 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set it up so cards use some specific bold fonts.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The fonts should appear bolded, like in the &quot;Sinngehalt_desktop.png&quot; images done with
the desktop client.. Instead they appear with a strange border effect, as seen in &quot;baumaterial_android.png&quot;

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens with some fonts and not with others.
But with those fonts, it happens all the time.

Please provide any additional information below.
I am not 100% sure that it is related to otf fonts, but it appears that ttf-fonts are
bolded correctly and otf fonts are not.

In the image, the three good looking kanji are done with the fonts
IPAPMincho.ttf
MotoyaLMaru.ttf
EPSON Gyousho.otf

the offending kanji is in
Moon font.otf

The left part of the bottom line is in 
IPAPMincho.ttf

The ugly right part in 
Praxis LT.otf


Unfortunately, the bad looking fonts are either large or non-free, so i can't really
append one of those.

I'll try it with a few other fonts.

I suspect this to happen when an actual suspended card is displayed somehow, though
I cannot image a case where this might happen. Countidx will then return a negative

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1265 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card template (mine are for Japanese Kana) using only characters (i.e.
fonts, no images)
2. Change size to whatever you feel like. I've tried up to 200px (I can now study using
the desktop client from the other side of the room)
3. Ankidroid presents the characters of both question and answer in what appears to
be the smallest font size which Android is capable of rendering)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- Character size should scale according to template information?
- Tiny, tiny characters.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every. Single. Time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
v2.0beta9

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.0.3 (ASUS Transformer TF-101)

Please provide any additional information below.
This is a deck which worked as expected on: the web (iphone to be exact, desktop (win
and osx), and Ankidroid - all 1.x. The *converted* deck looks normal on the beta web
and on win and osx clients. I've tried editing the templates as many ways as I can
think of (although admittedly I don't really know that much about how templates work)
and I still get tiny fonts in the Ankidroid client.
Screenshot attached.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1268 Using AnkiDroid v2.0beta9 on Android 2.2

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a deck with some suspended cards. In the summary screen, the due count might
indicate something like &quot;Due today: 10 0 10&quot;.
2. Open the card browser and unsuspend a card, then close the card browser.
3. The line still reads &quot;Due today: 10 0 10&quot;, when &quot;10 0 11&quot; is expected (if the card
wasn't new).

This error follows through into reviewing:
4. Click &quot;Start Reviewing&quot;.
5. The due count is now &quot;10 0 9&quot;, which is neither of the two values from before. The
unsuspended card does actually show up in the reviews, which means the due count can
end up with negative numbers.

Bonus bug:
If you have finished reviewing, and your due count is &quot;0 0 0&quot;, then unsuspending some
cards leaves your due count still as &quot;0 0 0&quot;. This means when you click &quot;Start Reviewing&quot;,
your lesson ends immediately, even though you have some cards waiting to be reviewed
since you just unsuspended them.

The due counts are corrected when you return to the deck picker screen.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1270 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review some mature cards
2. Look at the graphs &quot;Review count&quot; and &quot;Review Time&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect that the graphs show the number/the time of mature reviews in dark green.
Instead all reviews are shown as young cards (light green), on both AnkiDroid and Anki
Desktop.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time that I review mature cards.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
Ankidroid 2.0 beta 10

On what version of Android?
Android 2.2.2 (HTC Desire) and Android 3.2 (Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1).
Anki Desktop beta 18.

2. Review cards.
3. After 5 or so reviews, you should get the error message below.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected result is for the cards to review properly and not break the deck.

The output I get is this error message (attached BreaksAnkiDroidError.png):

&quot;An error occurred while writing to the collection.  This could be related to a corrupt
database or insufficient disk space...&quot;

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1274 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Select Default deck
2. Click on the &quot;Add card&quot; symbol
3. See that the note type is &quot;Cloze&quot;
4. Go back to the deck browser without creating a new card
5. Click on the &quot;Add card&quot; symbol in the deck browser
6. See that the note type is &quot;Basic&quot;

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The default note type of the Default deck should always be the more useful &quot;Basic.&quot;

Doing it the other way around gives the expected result, i.e.
1. Click on the &quot;Add card&quot; symbol in the deck browser
2. See that the note type is &quot;Basic&quot;

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1281 This crash is probably caused, because a font file is corrupt or just not a font file

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1285 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set up a deck that uses some special fonts. See below
2. After starting AnkiDroid, start reviewing
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
All text from the card should appear.
Instead, only parts of the text appears at first.
When the card is redrawn, for example after rotating the tablet, the text missing at
first is finally shown

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I am not quite sure. It may not happen every time, but quite frequently.

Please provide any additional information below.

I have attached one deck/model/card where i saw this problem.

The first image shows only a German word.
For the second image, i just rotated the tablet by 90⁰. Now there are two lines of
text. The upper line should have been there in the first image, too.

The IPAPMincho font of the first image can be found at http://ossipedia.ipa.go.jp/ipafont/index.html
the font of the German text (Demos LT) is a commercial font that i won't attach.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1288 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. For me, this happens every day.  I review all my cards in the morning (around 9
or 10am) until there are no more reviews.
2. I check again in the evening (I know it happens by 3pm, exact time unknown) and
I see 20 or so more review cards due (my usual daily dose for this deck)
3. If I review all of these and then check the next morning at 9am there are no new
reviews.  Reviews and also the new-cards seem to replenish in the middle of the day
instead of the middle of the night.

I'm wondering if it has to do with some time-zone or UTC issue?  I'm in the Pacific
time-zone on Android 4.0 and my phone clock shows the correct local time.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect that if I review at 6pm the previous day I can see more review cards
by 9am the next day.  And I wouldn't expect to get ~20 new reviews in the middle of
the day.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

All my decks show this every day.

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

I was using beta 2.4, but recently upgraded to 2.11.  The problem appears to persist.
 FWIW, one of my decks was originally created on my phone at the previous anki1 release,
and another one was created on my computer and synced through ankiweb to ankidroid.
 Both decks see the issue.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

No crash.  If there is any data (logs etc) I can collect though, let me know.

Please provide any additional information below.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1291 
What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. I made same tests with Anki Desktop (import, delete,…). I finished test with empty
all collection and synchronization.
2. I run AnkiDroid without synchronization and revise.
3. I run AnkiDroid synchronization. This one rewrites AnkiDroid collection with Anki
Desktop collection without any massage. 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I think that AnkiDroid has to warning if it wants to rewrite different collection and
offers possibility to choose what and where I want to synchronize.
I usually use both, Anki and AnkiDroid. If I am not sure about synchronization to web
and I want to keep collection on AnkiDroid for example I usually revise a few words
with AnkiDroid and run synchronization. AnkiDroid display a warning message about different
collections and I have a possibility to select collection for synchronization.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one
time?

Yes, I tried it again with the same result.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1293 First of all, please ignore Issue 1292 as I mistakenly hit the enter button while typing
the summary.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Using both Anki desktop and Ankidroid (synchronized)

3. Clicking either the new subdeck's options or parent deck's options

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the normal options window to appear. Instead, I get the following error which
Damien says comes from a mistake in Ankidroid's code ( https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ankisrs-users/DmH-EG_QRxQ/maAGhIZg72sJ

Please provide any additional information below.

Example template: 'Spanish term for &quot;{{English}}&quot;?'

In the above example, pressing the &quot;Play&quot; button only replays &quot;Spanish term for...&quot;
and then it stops. This seems to only happen if there is preset text in the template.
If the template contains only fields with no other text, I can replay the cards to
my heart's content.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1299 I have a Spanish and Catalán deck, and I've noticed when I try to add, for example the
word &quot;fence&quot; to one, I can't add it to the other because Anki thinks it's a duplicate.
Maybe my understanding of duplicates in Anki is poor, and if so, please correct me
on how to properly do this. But I think it would be able to use the same word in separate
decks. Thanks for all the hard work!

I would like to see the new cards I made on Windows show up on Ankidroid. They are
not displaying however.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes every time.

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1317 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set up a synced deck on Windows and Android
2. Change a card in AnkiDroid
3. Sync
4. In Desktop Anki's Card Browser, search for the card by name

What is the expected output?
The card should be found.

What do you see instead?
The card isn't found (but it still exists and can be found browsing manually through
the list).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happenend several times for me and I'm quite sure it's repeatable with above steps.
Maybe it also occurs under broader conditions.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
1.1.3

On what version of Android?
4.1.1 on European Nexus S

Version of Desktop Anki?
Windows 1.28

Additional information:

1. My guess is that AnkiDroid somehow stores the card data in a slightly different
way so that Desktop Anki has problems searching through the fields.
2. A workaround that works for me: In Desktop Anki do Tools -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Check Database...
Although it always states &quot;no problems were found&quot;, it consistently fixes the issue.
The drawback is, it forces a full sync with the server which causes unneccessary traffic.

Every time.

Ankidroid:
It worked all right with AnkiDroid 13, up to commit d9cec83cff2a2ddeaa92b4b823e47b5b3239fbd5
The commit 525f6238a80b7c78488f9d77173fa7f28a163f2e broke it.

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

The three images are:

 * The setting, with the font scaling set to 150%
 * The one card with the font at 150 %, using beta 13
 * The same card, with nothing changed but using the &quot;Improved relative font scaling&quot;
commit for Anki 14. The font is smaller.

The deck should contain the card shown.

The card does not use relative font sizes, even less nested relative font sizes. (Those
were mentioned in the comment which called the code &quot;not bullet proof&quot;.) The size is
set only once, in the .card{} bit.

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1325 I did install Anki 2.0 beta 18 on my Samsung Galaxy SII and did a backup of the database
before. Then I followed the instructions for conversion (let AnkiDroid upload the decks
to the web, convert them, download). Download produced an error and instructions followed
that I should try to repair my database with the desktop version. 

Unfortunately the desktop version also only shows two of my previously existing decks.
Then I logged in to Anki web and there I could find all five decks, though not the
most actual version (which is not so problematic).

Logging in to new Anki web I do see the same two decks that I see now in my desktop
version, but not more.

So my question is: How can I restore the backup on my Android device and synch ALL
decks to AnkiWeb and Anki Desktop (Win 7, Home Prof, 32 bit)

Kind regards and thank you very much in advance for helping me!

If this post is obsolete or in the wrong place please just let me know where to post
to get help and delete this post. Thank you very much!

Of course If I set it up to &quot;hide question&quot; it work for all cards. But I only want

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1336 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start reviewing with whiteboard and the tablet in portrait orientation. (Almost

2. Rotate so it is landscape orientation
3. Draw in the extreme right of the screen

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
What you draw should stay visible.
Instead it is clipped when you lift the finger


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens all the time.

(...)


Please provide any additional information below.

Screen size is 1024x768. The tablet is a cheap generic one. The actual type name is
TAB-PROTAB2-IPS9.

This appears quite similar, but not identical to issue #72.

I get similar problems when i start in horizontal or in vertical mode. But there seems
to be a small difference:
When i start in portrait and rotate to landscape, the clipping edge seems to be quite
close to what was the old right edge.
When i start in landscape and rotate to portrait, there is still clipping but the clipping
edge is a bit away from the old bottom edge.

The image names should explain what happens in each one.

P.S. There is a 「聞いて。」 missing in image 5. That is issue #1285.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1338 On Anki 2.0-beta18 on Windows, I renamed the default deck to &quot;US Presidents&quot; and moved
my US Presidents cards to the renamed default deck.

On AnkiDroid 2.0beta16, I tried to review that deck early, which is supposed to create
a temporary filtered deck, I think? But no additional deck was created, as far as I
can tell. However, the 16 cards it added to the review queue did appear with a due
date of (filtered) in the desktop card browser, even though they're still in the US
Presidents deck.

When I tap &quot;show answer&quot; on the first of these filtered cards in AnkiDroid, I get a
database error (&quot;An error occurred while writing to the collection...).

When I click &quot;show answer&quot; on the same card on the desktop, I get the following error

When the reviewer loses focus and is then re-focused, the timer that appears in the

Two common scenarios that reproduce this while reviewing a card:
1 - Push power button to turn off screen
2 - Push power button to turn on screen
3 - Unlock screen
4 - Back in AnkiDroid reviewer, timer is still paused.

or

1 - Bring up the recent apps list
2 - Select an app to open
3 - Close the app (either back button or app's own exit button)
4 - Back in AnkiDroid reviewer, timer is still paused.

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1345 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Not sure, happens during media syncing.

It means that after media syncing we have the wrong number of media files between ankiweb
and AnkiDroid

Which means that at least one of the following cases is not handled properly by Ankidroid
when media syncing:
- Add a media file in anki, means that while syncing AnkiDroid didn't manage to create
the file locally.
- Delete a media file in anki, means that while syncing AnkiDroid didn't manage to
delete the file locally.
- Add a media file in AnkiDroid, means that after syncing the server the server didn't
create the new file correctly.
- Delete a media file from AnkiDroid, means that after syncing the server hasn't deleted
the file.

The problem could be due to local FS issues not handled properly, or not sending the
right instructions to ankiweb when syncing (eg asking to delete wrong filenames that
don't exist).

Or due to hidden files in media folder not being picked up during syncing, but still
counted in the sanity check.

In other words this needs lots of investigation.

It's currently the most frequent problem in beta16 and although it doesn't cause crashes,
it triggers full media syncs which can consume a lot of bandwith both for the users
and ankiweb.

So it needs resolving.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1348 Using AnkiDroid 2.0beta16 on Archos 28 4GB, firmware 2.4.83, Android 2.2.1.

Steps:

1. While reviewing, tap the Home button to go to the Android home screen.

2. On the Android home screen, tap the AnkiDroid icon to return to AnkiDroid.

Observed behavior: Sometimes, when returning to AnkiDroid, I am returned to the same
card I was reviewing when I tapped the Home button. But at other times, the &quot;Opening
collection, please wait&quot; screen is briefly shown, and then there is a force close.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1350 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Learn with AnkiDroid on a tablet until you are done with a subdeck

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The due count for that deck should read 0 0 0
Instead, it shows the count from before you started reviewing.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens every time.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

It is not.

This may be related to issue #1235. At least it is a similar effect. My guess is that
both might be fixed in one go.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1354 AnkiDroid v2.0beta16 on Android 2.2

From this forum thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/anki-android/r0PeLQ1JZQ0

Setting this options:
Wrench --&gt; New Cards --&gt; Order --&gt; &quot;New cards in random order&quot;

...has no effect on the order of new cards. After setting this option and syncing with
Anki Desktop, the option remains ticked over there but the order is still not randomized
even in Anki Desktop. (So it seems the order is supposed to be set once the option
is ticked, not when reviewing starts.)

Going the other way around does work as you'd expect, however. That is, on Anki Desktop,
selecting &quot;New cards in random order&quot; then syncing to AnkiDroid results in new cards
appearing in random order on AnkiDroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1355 AnkiDroid v2.0beta16 on Android 2.2

(This behaviour was present in beta15, so it wasn't broken by this change http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=1343)


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set a timebox interval of 1 minute.
2. Review for several few minutes
3. Observe only the first notification


The desktop client continues to show timebox notifications even after the first period
has elapsed.


Please provide any additional information below.
Apart from the notification itself, the desktop client also informs you how many cards
you answered during the time period, whereas AnkiDroid does not.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1359 Hi,
I've only got one very simple question. I created several collections of cards on Anki
Windows. These cards contain pictures or soundfiles and they use special fonts. I thought
I could import all that on my Android pad in order to sometimes learn a bit on it and
then later copy back the Anki file to this main computer. But it seems that Ankidroid
is a completely different program : it doesn't recognize anki files and I can see no
way to convert easily one into the other. Even worse : Ankidroid doesn't take pictures
and sounds. Is it right to think that it's hopeless?
Thank your for your answer.

and the rating buttons remain colored texts on white ground. White backgrounds cost
a lot of battery-energy and the bright background blinds and hurts my eyes. And the
texts on the rating buttons are difficult to read.

Please make the Cards and the rating buttons of the &quot;Android dark&quot; layout with white
text on black background. Only then the &quot;Android dark&quot; layout is in accordance with
the well chosen standard Android layout with white texts on black background for best
ergonomics and energy saving on mobile phones.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1369 I've submitted this issue before (1293), but although Norbert updated the status there
to FixedInDev, I'm still having the problem.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Using both Anki desktop and AnkiDroid (synced)
2. Creating a subdeck in the desktop client
3. Syncing with AnkiDroid
4. Clicking either the new subdeck's options or parent deck's options in the desktop
client

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the normal options window to appear. Instead, if I choose &quot;Options&quot; under
the gear menu in the Decks screen, I get the following error:

Damien says the error comes from a mistake in Ankidroid's code ( https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ankisrs-users/DmH-EG_QRxQ/maAGhIZg72sJ
)


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one
time?
Every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)
V 2.0 Beta 16

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android version) 4.1.1
(tablet), 2.3.3 CM (phone)


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

Note: I have attached two screen clippings. Please refer to them to understand the
explanation below.

First of all, please note that this error doesn't occur in AnkiDroid. I'm able to access
the options in all the decks and subdecks without a problem in AnkiDroid. Instead,
it occurs in the desktop client, although apparently AnkiDroid is responsible for causing
it.

Second of all, the problem started when I created a new deck called &quot;textmem&quot; and moved
382 cards to it from &quot;Default&quot;. I then made &quot;textmem&quot; a subdeck of &quot;Default&quot;. The problem
probably started after I synced with AnkiWeb a few times from both Anki and AnkiDroid.
When I filed issue 1293 and Norbert was looking into it, I remember that if I made
&quot;textmem&quot; an independent deck, I could access the options in &quot;Default&quot; just fine. If
I then moved &quot;textmem&quot; under &quot;Default&quot; as a subdeck again, the problem returned. I
verified this a few times. Norbert then had me send him my deck. He said that he found
the problem and fixed it. He then gave me steps to resolve the issue. It didn't work.
After a few weeks, for some reason, I had to format all my electronics - my laptop,
tablet, and phone. So, I reinstalled Anki and AD and downloaded the content from AnkiWeb
again. Since then, the problem doesn't go away, regardless of whether I make &quot;textmem&quot;
an independent deck or subdeck of &quot;Default&quot;. In fact, it got worse. I recently added
a bunch of subdecks to &quot;Default&quot; to organize the introduction of new material. Now,
trying to access the options in either the parent or any subdeck (all 12 of them) results
in the two errors listed above. Please refer to the screen clippings to understand.

Thank you for your help.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1372 I'm sorry, but I can't reproduce this issue. It happens sporadically to me (seems to
be at least a few times a week), but I haven't been able to pinpoint the conditions
to reproduce the problem. I get a &quot;known issue&quot; response when I send my error logs
so maybe you already know about it.

It seems likely that the database is not actually corrupted because if I choose &quot;clear
all errors&quot; and then force close the app using task manager, then upon restarting the
app I no longer get the corrupted database error and continue reviewing as if it never
happened.

I think this is a really serious problem, please let me know if there is anything I
can do to help with debugging.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1383 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. load beta.ankiweb.net for first time 
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expect to see all my decks from www.ankiweb.net. But I am still decks missing. One
is called 'Nederlands', the other is called 'English'. Can you please help me out?!

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I can only do it one time. So please help me out moving them (or give me a workaround?)

cards of the next day are shown and then I cannot continue because I would repeat cards
after three hours or even less.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. ?? maybe the problem is that the webserver is somewhere overseas and there it is
right. 
2. Maybe giving the cards exactly 24 hours * days to be repeated
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

But since I noticed Ankidroid is making an order in case of the alphabet, I´d like
to have Numbers in the title. But now the numbers sticking with the title &quot;02Les Champs-Elysées&quot;,
I´d like to have it like this &quot;02 - Les Champ-Elysées&quot;.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1393 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Set new card steps to &quot;1 10 100 1400&quot;, and set graduate interval to 2 days.
2.After learning for 1 day, and open the application on 2nd day
3.In deck summary, the due count is&quot;20 6 50&quot;, however, in all decks list, the due count
of this deck is&quot;20 0 50&quot;, the 2nd number is always 0.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The 2nd number should be also 6 which is identical to real situation. But in my configuration,
it's always 0. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes, every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
Ankidroid 2.0 beta 17
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
android 4.0.4

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
Not crash.

Please provide any additional information below.
I set the graduate interval to 2 days, because the words are a little difficult to
remember and need more time to learn.

I expect Anki to place one-field data in the first field. Instead, it places it in
the second field. I have to press Swap twice (potentially more based on the note) on
each new card before adding it, wiping out benefits expected from using saved data.

In the default &quot;Basic&quot; note, the one-field text is sent to &quot;Back&quot; instead of &quot;Front&quot;.

two fields.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1397 What steps will reproduce the problem?
These are the steps I took, I don't know if they can be reproduced with any deck.
1. I had a deck of 400 cards that I was reviewing daily.
2. In preparation for a test, I chose &quot;Review Early,&quot; chose 2 days, and created the
filtered deck. I then opened the deck and chose &quot;Start Reviewing&quot; and the app crashed
(I submitted a bug report).
3. I then tried again, crashed again, and submitted another stacktrace.
4. I then tried 1 day instead of 2, but it crashed again.
5. Finally I tried to create a Cram deck manually, but trying to review it also crashed.
6. Each time I tried something new, I deleted the old review/cram deck and started
again.
7. At the end of the process I noticed my Default deck (which I've never used) had
30 cards in it. I opened it up and saw they were some cards from my original deck of
400. I then opened my original deck and saw it only contained 303 cards. I immediately
did a full sync from my desktop and downloaded that sync to my Android to revert the
damage, but something went seriously wrong here...

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Working filtered/cram/review early decks. Instead got a serious of crashes and data
corruption.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happened consistently each time I tried.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

You should have received 4-5 stacktrace reports from me in a row, about 15 minutes

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time. Also it's reproducible from the repetition view.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1412 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have previously detected Anki 1.0 format decks on first run of Anki 2.0.
2.Select the third option of zipping and uploading deck.
3. When you receive progress box, use accelerometer to reorientate the screen from
landscape to portait or vice versa.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to still see progress information. Instead it disappears and an unknowing
user may unwittingly think it finished and click continue or something else that may
be an ynfavorable action.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Didnt bother to repeat

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1419 Issue 778 and issue 1415 are related.

AnkiDroid currently seems to have its own feature for adding custom fonts, but that
feature doesn't seem to work when the font is explicitly set for a current field already,
and it relies on the filename for the font name instead of using the native font name.

Unlike Anki 1, Anki 2 documents a way to add fonts to the media folder. Not only will
this also set the fonts up properly for the desktop, but it will ensure the fonts are
included as part of a normal sync and means that no further setup is required on the
mobile clients or web client. More info:

http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#installingfonts

Two questions:

- does this work on AD already? If the html base tag has been set to the media folder,
the AD webviews should be able to pick up the font automatically
- is there any point to having the separate fonts folder on AnkiDroid now that such
a feature exists? It seems silly to have to configure it more than once.

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1429 I'm trying to add support for creating flash cards in AnkiDroid from my dictionary app.
It works fine with 2.0 but with 1.1.3 (but the current version in Google Play) it just
crashes.

It is crashing with a null pointer in line 595 of CardEditor.java, which is this bit
of code:

    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        MenuItem item;
        Resources res = getResources();
&gt;&gt;HERE&gt;&gt;    Lookup.initialize(this, mDeck.getDeckPath());

I guess mDeck is null. It looks like it's trying to launch a dialog to allow the user
to select the deck but this line is trying to use the deck before it has been selected.

The same crash is replicatable with the Indiclash sample code here:
https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/Indiclash

As a side note, it looks like the name of the intent has changed from     org.openintents.indiclash.CREATE_FLASHCARD
to org.openintents.action.CREATE_FLASHCARD in 2.0. I think I'm going to make my app
just try both strings. Is there a good reason to change the name? Isn't that just going
to break any existing apps that are already using the old string?

It's not clear from the description on openintents which string is the canonical one.

I created a filtered deck on Android (beta 19)

Synced with my desktop (2.0.0)

On my desktop, I clicked on deck options for the new, filtered deck and got the following
response:

===========

An error occurred. It may have been caused by a harmless bug,
 or your deck may have a problem.
 To confirm it's not a problem with your deck, please run Tools &gt; Maintenance &gt; Check
Database.
 If that doesn't fix the problem, please copy the following
 into a bug report:
 Traceback (most recent call last):

line 98, in loadConf KeyError: 'delays'

=========

I ran Tools &gt; Maintenance &gt; Check Database and it didn't help.

This was originally posted on the desktop bug list as No. 130, but closed and I was
told to repost on Ankidroid bug list.

Regards,
Paul.

of the text that I'm trying to memorize is put in a cloze. I'm usually learning those
cards by suspending the last cloze (which includes the whole text) until I've learned
the single portions and after some time unsuspending it again.

This works quite well in the desktop version of Anki2, but on the current beta version
of Ankidroid those cards always show the content of both fields, one with the cloze
working properly, the other showing the whole text (nothing blanked out), so I always
see the answer, which is rather counter-productive.

I'm using the following syntax on those cloze deletion cards:

{{#Field1}}{{cloze:Field1}}{{/Field1}}
{{#Field2}}{{cloze:Field2}}{{/Field2}}

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1451 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a deck where the front side has a photo that wouldn't normally fit on the
phone screen in portrait orientation (I believe I've been using ones that are approx.
640x440px).
2. If starting to review in portrait orientation, everything works as expected. The
image is sized to fit, and if you rotate the screen to landscape orientation, the image
is resized to fit the new screen.
3. However, if you start the review with the phone already in landscape orientation,
the photo isn't sized appropriately (you have to scroll down some to view the entire
photo). It gets even worse when you then switch to portrait orientation (you have to
scroll left/right and up/down to see the whole photo).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Resizing photos should be consistent regardless of the orientation when entering review
mode. It seems like the photo should always be sized to fit the screen (or if not,
at least be consistent in all cases).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It is consistent every time.

Onn the new web interface I see all decks but I dont see any media files (it says &quot;0.00

All media files on the PC are &quot;next the deck&quot;. 

How can I set Anki PC to upload also the media files?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1454 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Attempt to sync on versions higher than (not including) v17

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect it to sync successfully, instead, it often ahngs at 0 on both down and
up. Sometimes it goes a little higher, sometimes a LOT higher, but it always seems
to eentually stall before the sync is completed.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Almost every time. Out of my dozens of attempts, syncing only succeeded once.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)

v18 and v19 are the bugged versions. I'm forced to stick with v17 for now in order
to sync.

Please provide any additional information below.

Syncing never completes, and I am unable to use the application without forcing a close,
which then seems to corrupt something, forcing me to uninstall and reinstall to even
launch the application again. I also have to delete the AnkiDroid folder most time
(though not always!).

The other way around it works. When there are two files and the second one is missing,
the first one is played.

I have made a short deck with two &quot;[sound:NN]&quot;s on each card and only one file in the
package to demonstrate. Two cards, one with the extant file first and one with the
file second.
(It is hard to tell if one of the file that are not in the collection is played or
not ;) .)

Happens always. With different decks.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1470 What steps will reproduce the problem?

2. Proceed to new cards
3. Either answer card or bury card
4. The cards will not be in a random order, regardless of settings.

What is the expected output? Cards which have review order set to &quot;Random&quot; should be
random.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? It did not use to happen,
it only suddenly started to happen. Now, as far as I can tell, it happens almost 100%
of the time. There are rare occasions where re-importing the deck will fix the issue.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.0 v18

On what version of Android? 2.3.5


Please provide any additional information below.

If indexing can cause issues (see below), it would be nice to know when a deck does
not have an index, and then be given the option to regenerate one.


Note from Damien:

Damien Elmes November 6th, 2012 @ 11:45 PM

I've had a look into it. This is happening because the collection is
missing an index, which is causing the cards to appear in creation
order instead of honoring the due column. Please report this issue on
the AD issue tracker.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1487 Sibling Spacing does not seem to be obeyed in Anki Droid (beta 20).

I have the settings for AD and the desktop (Anki 2.0.3) set the same, i.e. minimum
sibling range 5 days, space siblings by up to 50% (whatever that means). And “try not
to show new cards next to each other” is checked.   

Nevertheless, siblings continue to arise very close together (i.e., same day/study
session).

Other questions or advice, please? Thank you.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1489 On AnkiDroid 2 beta 20. Nexus 10 with Android 4.2.

The graphs on the summary screen don't update properly. These might be two different
bugs.

1. After going into the reviewer and tapping the back button, the graph ends up looking
like one on top of another (see screenshots). Touching the graph makes the top one
disappear, so it looks like a painting issue instead of two actual graphs.

2. The graph (that remains after the top one is cleared) isn't updated. If you do some
reviews and tap the back button, the graph you get is the same one as before the reviews.
Selecting another deck and then back to the one you reviewed with updates the graph
as expected.

Reproducible every time.

If you complete a deck and choose to review early, a new dynamic deck is created. The
first screen you are taken to is not the usual screen for dynamic decks, but for normal
decks. Thus, it's not possible to change options and rebuild without leaving the screen
and going back into the dynamic deck.

IIRC, the desktop Anki always goes back to showing the question when you return from
the edit dialog, even when not moving cards. That seems a reasonable approach to dealing
with this.

I get the actual number when I revert back to beta 20.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happens all the time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) Ankidroid 2 beta 20
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) &quot;Jellybean&quot; 4.1.2


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

The results of typed answers (on the answer side) always appear the top instead of
being inlined in the original location in the template. 

There's also no complete comparison with the proper answer if the typed part doesn't
match, which the desktop version shows. See screenshot comparisons. I don't know if
this was intentional (to save space on mobile screens, for example).

If AnkiDroid is killed where the last activity had been the reviewer, then, when resumed,
you can't go back to the deck picker.

Pretty sure this was introduced in beta 21.

Note that putting the same font with Hebrew glyphs into /Ankidroid/Fonts makes the

glyphs.

no harm. But my phone is mips-based, so installing fails. But if I manually remove

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1524 Thanks a lot for all the time you've put into fixing the display problems for Hebrew
vowels! It's already looking much better, but there are still some serious issues.
I've mentioned everything I spotted but not all of the issues are equally serious.

I've create a small deck for testing: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2812525236.


CARD 1

The first card of the deck uses two fonts, which have been included in media and css
via @fontface: &quot;Ezra SIL&quot; for the whole card and &quot;Cardo&quot; for the transcribed words
(in green). I've taken screenshots on Win7 (Anki and AnkiWeb) and two Android devices
(AnkiDroid and AnkiWeb): see attachments.

In summary:
1) Display on Anki: perfect.
2) Display on AnkiDroid:
   a) With Tohu.ttf (AnkiDroid workaround for Hebrew vowels): very good (but see below).
   b) Without Tohu.ttf: for some reason, on Android 4 (tablet), even though &quot;Ezra SIL&quot;
is for the card overall, the Hebrew words are displayed in the system font. The vowel
positions are reasonably good, better than on Android 2 (HTC Desire with Cyanogenmod),
which uses &quot;Ezra SIL&quot; for the Hebrew words.
3) Display on AnkiWeb:
   a) Chrome on Win7: perfect.
   b) Dolphin on Android 2 (Cyanogenmod): perfect.
   c) Dolphing, Chrome or native browser on Android 4: same as 2) b) above.

Have you got any idea why 2) b) and 3) c) happen?


The other cards demonstrate some issues I have encountered with the AnkiDroid Tohu.ttf
solution.


CARD 2

This card contains a list of all consonants and the main vowel-combination. Anki displays
all correctly (except for pure vowels, which are only needed for grammar decks). But
AnkiDroid has the following issues:

- Dageshes are not displayed correctly, especially for the narrow letters, but also
for צּ and שּ.
- Shevas and central, lower vowels (qames, hireq etc.) are not in the right position
for גְ, דְ, וְ, זְ, יְ, ךְ, נְ, רְ
- holem overlaps with לֹ


CARD 3

This card has a few lines of Hebrew text, which also includes accents. It shows that
Tohu.ttf has inherited the Cardo.ttf-bug of overlapping lines. Also, it displays the
line from bottom to top.
And, in addition to the issues of card 2, it doesn't distinguish holem waw (the central
letter in יוֹם) from waw+holem (וֹ).


CARD 4

This card demonstrates that AnkiDroid does reverse the order of letters or letter groups
within words, if they are contained in span-sections (e.g. because they are highlighted
in different colors).


CARD 5

This card demonstrates that AnkiDroid sometimes revereses the order of letters, if
they are separated by dashes or spaces.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1527 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Create a new deck within AnkiDroid; it'll only have 2 facts set.
2.Add some cards.
3.Import the deck to desktop Anki.
4.Adjust layout to have more facts as needed (3, for instance); this step probably
&quot;corrupts&quot; the deck and I'll provide more details about this step below; I'll refer
to the deck as &quot;corrupted&quot; later on.
5.Export the deck back to .anki file, overwrite it in AnkiDroid.
6.Try adding new cards for the corrupted deck (different ways tried - from within deck's
main window and from cards browser).
7.See excuses about unfortunate stop.
8.Loop to step 6.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected is card edition window with 3 empty fields to type in. Crash dialog is seen
instead.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time for any &quot;corrupted&quot; deck.

AnkiDroid version: 1.1.3
Anki desktop version: 1.2.8
Android version: 4.0.3 (release5a), on Sony Tablet S

Please provide any additional information below.
&quot;Corruption&quot; step details: additional fact was added, fonts, colors and font sizes
were changed; new fonts were Glyph-oriented - MS Mincho, KaiTi (for aesthetic perception);
exported deck shows all glyph characters on droid-device correctly, though fancy fonts
are not working - it all casts down to plain Arial (I don't know, if AnkiDroid does
the conversion, or the fonts are missing on my device, or the Android itself doesn't
allow messing around fonts... Couldn't figure out). Now the corrupted deck may be edited
- all existing cards are shown properly, one might browse them all and edit any facts
as wished (though I havn't actually tried to save changes); the deck may be reviewed;
nothing seems wrong until you try to add a new card - it crashes instantly.
I tried to &quot;fix&quot; the corruption: opened the deck on desktop Anki, switched all fonts
explicitly to Arial and exported it; it WORKED in 1 particular case - the deck containing
just 1 single card was &quot;cured&quot; and now works fine. But this didn't &quot;cure&quot; my other
deck with 68 cards; I finally had to convert it to plain tabulated text and re-import
it to Anki desktop, loosing all schedule and layout info. This new re-assembled deck
works fine currently on Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1528 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Launch Ankdroid Samsung S3 that has clipboard bug
2. Open saved deck
3. Click &quot;Start reviewing&quot;
4. Watch it crash!

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect it to open my deck, but it crashes instead. My S3 currently has the 'clipboard
bug' http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1781060 but I don't want to root
my phone yet, so I have to put up with having no clipboard.

When I start Ankidroid, anki.Reviewer.onCreate calls into anki.Reviewer.clipboardSetText
which goes to ClipboardManager.setPrimaryClip and that eventually leads to a NullPointerException
because of a bug in Samsung's clipboard code.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

I know this problem isn't your fault, but I'd like to be able to keep using Ankidroid

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1532 AnkiDroid beta 22 on Android 4.2.1 on Nexus 10 (tablet).

If AnkiDroid remains open while the next day (in Anki offset terms) ticks over, then
AnkiDroid seems to enter some bad state. The counts on the decks are not updated, and
if you try to review, you only get a white screen in the reviewer with the spinner
in the top-right. It looks like it's stuck re-loading the collection.

At this point I hit back enough times close AnkiDroid (which I believe closes the collection).
Opening AnkiDroid again shows only the splash screen, and it appears to be stuck on
it. Hitting back at this point crashes AnkiDroid.

2. Select &quot;Dots -&gt; Share page -&gt; AnkiDroid card&quot;

What is the expected output? 
A new card is created

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1537 Start tutorial deck, and go through it.
Cards have a dark bar on the right which cuts through the text.

I expect either dark bar not to be present, or text to word wrap.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Only tried on new install of AnkiDroid.

Ankidroid 2.0beta22, android 4.1.2


De-installed Ankidroid 1.x, and installed above straight from http://ankidroid.googlecode.com/files/AnkiDroid-2.0beta22.apk
 - no previous 2.0 betas present.

showing up more than once even during the same round.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1550 In anki 2, ankiweb lists an empty deck named &quot;default&quot; which can not be deleted. This
deck does not show in the anki desktop client, but it does appear in ankidroid. I assume
there is some technical reason why this deck has to exist.
Since this deck does not contain any data, I would prefer it to be hidden from the
deck list.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1558 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.did not import old decks after update.

file. All my decks have always been .anki
3.Kant start any of the .anki decs and have no idea what the .apkg file is.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see all my decks that I was studdying to be there after the update. What
I get is a new anki with no decks. 


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

I now have the new 2.0 Don't know what the version what that I had before. But I had
it set in googleplay to automaticaly update. I assume its predisessor.


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

It does not crash. It just didn't bring over the decks I was using before.

Please provide any additional information below.
I have spent now 3.5 hours trying to get my old decks working. And I am vary unhappy.
I can not understand why they would not make the update in a way that would just bring
over all the settings and data of the older version of Anki. Any why wold it not open
the old files .anki whey the previous version would do it every time. I also keep the
files on my MicroSd card that way I could study at school on there computers with the
wondows version of anki. That still works just fine. It opens that files no problem.
but now it does not work anymore on my Azus Transformer prime tablet.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1559 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I created a new deck with my Windows-PC (Anki 2.0.3),
2. synchronized it with my account@Anki and than
3. I synchronized it with my Android-Phone.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I created on my pc on the front-side of the card two {{type:&quot;xxx&quot;}}-fields, which are
used at the backside too (to compare the answers). At my PC works everything very well.
But if I open the deck on my Android-Phone, it doesn't work (enclosed a screenshot).
For example, Ankidroid shows only one of the two input-fields. The second-one appears
as code-line. And the process of comparison doesn't work also.

happen only one time?
Every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1562 On AnkiDroid v2.1alpha1

The Import Cards option brings up a menu telling you to place your apkg file into a
certain directory. When using internal storage, the suggested directory is wrong (from
a user's perspective).

On phone with SD card: /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid
On tablet with internal storage: /storage/emulated/0/AnkiDroid.

The message should also say that this directory is &quot;the AnkiDroid directory&quot;, so at
least the user knows what this path is supposed to mean. Some (most?) file browsers
don't show you the /mnt/ part.

If you select the Import Cards menu option, you get a dialog box telling you to place
your apkg file in some location and then clicking &quot;OK&quot;. If you leave this window (say,
to go to a file manager to move the apkg to the right place) and go back to AnkiDroid,
that menu disappears, so you can't click &quot;OK&quot; to continue importing. Going to back
to the menu and clicking Import Cards doesn't show a dialag anymore. You need to close
AnkiDroid (back button) and open it again for the dialog to start working again.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1569 Recent Anki desktop versions make it easier for people who previously used the Anki
1.2 selective study feature. While users in many cases may be able to create subdecks
for each of their lesson tags, that requires the desktop version to set up.

- AD currently only shows 'custom study' from the finished screen, meaning users can't
use the 'limit to tags' option until they've finished the deck first. It should be
in the menu (or even on the screen).
- The 'limit to tags' option currently presents a very tiny input box where users have
to manually type the tags. The desktop version instead displays two lists of tags allowing
users to select and deselect the tags they want (just as in 1.2's custom study), which
makes selection a lot more user friendly. A similar feature is coming in the next AM
release as well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1577 Anki 2.0 manual (&quot;Changes in Anki 2&quot;) recommends the following method of selective study
instead of tag-based one:
==================================================
If you were using selective study to control introduction of new cards (such as blocking
lessons 5-18 from being displayed), you could also convert each lesson into a deck,
but that’s somewhat cumbersome. An easier method would be to suspend the cards you’re
not ready for, and then unsuspend them on a per-lesson basis when you’re ready to study
them. You could do it like this:
    1. Search for &quot;tag:lesson* is:new&quot; to find all new cards with a lesson tag. Select
them all, and suspend them.
    2. Assuming you were halfway through lesson4 before upgrading, search for tag:lesson4
is:new&quot; and unsuspend any cards that got suspended by the previous step.
    3. When you’re ready to move on to lesson 5, search for &quot;tag:lesson5&quot; and unsuspend
the cards. 
==================================================

But using expressions like &quot;tag:NNN&quot; or &quot;is:new&quot; seems not working in AnkiDroid Browser.
I also did not find interface elements like &quot;Select all&quot; and &quot;Suspend&quot;.

How to suspend the cards I’m not ready for in AnkiDroid?
If there is no way to do it in AnkiDroid, I'd like this to be added to the TODO list.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1582 Shared deck handling in 2.0 would originally add decks to an AnkiWeb account, but that
is no longer the case. For that reason, AD should no longer force people to sign up/in
to AnkiWeb prior to downloading shared decks, as an AnkiWeb account is only necessary
if they want to rate or comment on a deck.

The Default deck should disappear, but nothing happens. When I try the deletion on
the website, a message informs me that the default deck can't be removed - which seems
stupid (my other decks are organized by language, so what's the point of having a &quot;default&quot;
deck?); but even more stupid is the current AnkiDroid behavior.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1597 I have 37104 files in my collection.media/ directory on the desktop version of Anki.
 When I try to move them to the sd card of my phone to use with AnkiDroid (either through
the sync functionality of AnkiDroid, or through manually copying them over), I get
errors that there are too many files in a single directory (the collection.media/ directory).


Is there any way to work around this?  I would be happy with an option like &quot;Don't
Download/Sync Media&quot;.  Or maybe an option not to download/sync specific decks from
Ankiweb.

My trouble-shooting steps thus far:
I have deleted and reinstalled AnkiDroid, re-synced my decks, and followed the trouble-shooting
advice provided by Tim on the forum (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/anki-android/Bxfw37_j-rw/6GQXeMTKg4YJ).
Also, I followed the upgrading instructions posted on the website and have had no issues
with the version of Anki I'm running on my PC.

I am including my collection of cards and the SendLog, in hopes that it helps you to
solve the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1608 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. open the card list for a single stack
-- list all stacks
-- open a single stack
-- click the second button to list all cards in that stack

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Observere that with ankidroid v2 the list is no longer usable as a personalized dictionary.
If you have the fact that &quot;blue&quot; translates to &quot;blau&quot; in German, while &quot;red&quot; is &quot;rot&quot;,
with ankidroid v1 this would appear as:

blue    - blau
red     - rot

Now it appears as:

blue    - German Deck Name
red     - German Deck Name

Obviously it is no longer usable as a personalized dictionary that way.
Moreover the presented information is totally useless,
as it will be the same for every single entry.
Thus it does not provide any additional information,
and is redundant with the title of the screen.

Expected output:

a personalized dictionary, e.g.
something similar to the output of ankidroid v1



Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?
Or did it happen only one time?

100% reproducible, seems to be by design

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1614 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a new card by dragging a 300 by 300 pixel jpg image from a web page to the

2. Type text for the &quot;Back&quot; field of the card.
3. Study the deck with the card and view the answer screen for the card. The text from
the &quot;Back&quot; field is mostly covered up by the buttons with &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, or &quot;Easy&quot;.
To see the answer you need to drag the image up.

What is the expected output? I expect the image and the answer to fully display at

What do you see instead?  The answer is mostly covered by the response buttons.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1619 Anki Desktop uses the term &quot;filtered deck&quot; which I think is more clear. Can we change
the term to be more consistent with Anki Desktop? 

I don't think there's any difference a &quot;filtered deck&quot; on Anki and a &quot;dynamic deck&quot;
on AnkiDroid right?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1627 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. App was working fine prior to last update.
2. When app was updated to 2.0 I could no longer see the decks that I had previously
been using.
3.  Decks now no longer show up.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I should see the decks that I had created on the previous version, I don't see any
decks at all.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
All the time.

3. Entered my email address as Firstname.Lastname@gmail.com and got invalid username/password
twice.
4. Tried a third time with lower case email address (firstname.lastname@gmail.com)

My keyboard automatically uppercases the first letter in the username field so this
could be a common reason for login failures.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1654 If any of the media contain wildcards (i.e., '*' and '?') or invalid characters as far
as the FAT filesystem is concerned (like ':') sync will fail. For the user this might
seem to work fine if they are using platforms (like Linux and Mac) where these characters
are allowed.

Note also that this would fail on those devices where the file system is FAT, but would
work on those that use ext3 or ext4.

Not sure what the solution would be. Maybe communicating this better to the user?

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
Found on 2.0.1beta14, also present on 2.0

Please provide any additional information below.

- Also note, that the app will allow me to enter whatever string there, such values
clear the existing text, but I assume internally a more sane value is chosen.

--&gt; This is a separate issue but renaming the first &quot;Custom steps&quot; to &quot;Enable custom
steps&quot; will improve the ui.

Alternatively the interface can be reworked to use one single Custom steps entry, in
which an invalid/empty value enables the default values.

1. Open a deck from deck picker
2. Menu -&gt; preferences -&gt; General -&gt; change the collection path
3. Click back twice (close general, and preferences activities)

What is the expected output? 
Closing the preferences activity should open the deck picker with the new collection,
as it does if the preferences menu is accessed from the deck picker.

What do you see instead?
In this case chosen deck is kept &quot;open&quot;, leaving the app in an unstable state. It is
even possible to &quot;do reviews&quot;, although did not check if the review answers where stored.

Going back, goes to the old (already closed?) collection, and selecting a deck produces
the errors reported in the triage tools as:
http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_bug?bug_id=4412051

Please provide any additional information below.

The fix for this issue is important to prevent errors if the profile switching get's
implemented. I assume similar issues could be observed if it is not done carefully.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1665 AnkiDroid 2.0.1beta14 on Android 4.2.1.

AnkiDroid has started crashing when a deck (normal or filtered) is deleted on my tablet.
The same collection on my phone (Android 2.3) doesn't crash.

Triage: http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/view_crash?crash_id=4414049
Forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/anki-android/_gKUpnWAJfQ

I've attached the collection that causes this. Checking the database on the desktop
client makes the problem go away.

Attaching a debugger reveals this detailed message at the point of the exception:
Couldn't read row 4799, col 0 from CursorWindow.  Make sure the Cursor is initialized
correctly before accessing data from it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1666 What steps will reproduce the problem?
0. This is only reproducible on devices with soft-menu button on the ActionBar.
1. Open a deck (going to Study Options Activity)
2. Change language: Preferences-&gt;Langugage-&gt;...
3. Go back to Study Options Activity
4. Click menu button

What is the expected output?
Menu list is displayed

What do you see instead?
App crashes

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1668 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Accidentally write three opening and two closing braces in the card template (`{{{Field
name}}`)
2. Don't notice the error because desktop Anki shows the field 
3. Review a card like that on AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

What i saw:
The field text is not show. Text after the the field also disappears.

What should happen?
Not sure. Maybe
*Parse things the way the desktop client does
*Or show an error
*Or show one opening brace and the field. (That's what i think would be the Right Thing.)

But i think it should not eat up other fields or text from the template.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1671 Bug 3561092 has assigned 5 crashes that correspond to a different issue... or does it
have 113 crashes with a different cause?

For crashes on 2.0, exception &quot;android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabaseLockedException:
database is locked (code 5): retrycount exceeded&quot; was thrown,

In the same Bug, crashes 4067466, 3926164, 3929170, 3716036, 3563097, failed for &quot;java.lang.IllegalStateException:
database /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/collection.anki2 (conn# 0) already closed&quot;.

Currently the signature is generated by looking into the offending line in com.ichi2.anki
package, but between versions that is likely to be different code.

So, it could be improved by taking into account either:
- The exception class, the message could contain variable data (paths, numbers), or
- The stack of calls inside anki package (com.ichi2...). Ignoring the line numbers.

So for instance crash 4255054 has a signature:
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.queryString
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDatabaseManager.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker.handleDbError
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker$40$1.onPostExecute
at com.ichi2.async.DeckTask.onPostExecute
at com.ichi2.async.DeckTask.onPostExecute

An crash 3926164 has signature:
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.queryString
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDb.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.AnkiDatabaseManager.closeDatabase
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker.handleDbError
at com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker.onActivityResult

Hopefully that signature could be a little less version specific (i.e. the call chain
of similar crashes in different version should be the same), and help to distinguish
different crashes happening on the same line in different versions.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1675 As of AnkiDroid 2.0.1

A quick way to reproduce this is to open a deck, go to Options -&gt; Reviews -&gt; Space
siblings by up to, then enter &quot;4&quot;. After tapping &quot;OK&quot;, you will notice the value is
read back to you as &quot;3&quot;. 

Internally, that value, which is divided by 100, is being stored as 0.03999999910593033.
When you sync and open the options on the desktop, that value is also parsed as 3 (but
fixed when saved again). 

It's possible this can cause problems elsewhere, but for now I've only seen problems
with the options group values.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1678 First of all, I'm not sure if this is a problem with AnkiDroid or AnkiDesktop. I'm glad
to transfer it to AnkiDesktop if the problem is not with the Android version.

When I check the &quot;Review Time&quot; graphs on both system I notice there's a mismatch between
the values. In the attachments, this is clearly visible for &quot;today&quot; (i.e. the most
right bar): the AnkiDesktop version shows that my review exceeded 10 minutes, while
the Android version thinks its under 10 minutes.
My suspicion is that the ticks are not drawn correctly on the vertical axis, since
the other bars show conflicting values if you focus on the 10 minute mark.

AnkiDroid version: 2.0.1
AnkiDesktop version: 2.0.8

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1679 What steps will reproduce the problem?

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

  I would expect this to be a per-deck setting, and that would be useful, since I want
a smaller number of reviews for a phrasebook than for vocabulary words. Instead setting
the max-reviews setting for one deck effects all of the others too.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

 It's reproducible every time.

Instead, it seems as if the width is fitted to the zooming while the height remains
unchanged, making the image very long and thin and in many cases unreadable.

When touching the screen while reviewing, no whiteboard markings will appear on the

No change after choosing &quot;Clear whiteboard&quot;.


It's the same basically every time. 

I have only been able to use the whiteboard once (suddenly started working after using
the app for a while, switching between decks) but not been able to make it work again.

The added vocab is still in the &quot;saved data list&quot;, maybe this causes the crash?
To add more than one vocab, I have to go back twice (to the menu) and do the procedure
again. By this way, the saved data list is updated, the afore added vocab is, like
it should be, missing.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1692 Since the auto update to Ankidroid v2.0.1, I just can't seem to get the keyboard to
come up when I am trying to write my answer even though the &quot;write answer&quot; option has
been checked in preferences.

If anyone can help it would be much appreciated.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1693 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open software
2. go into tools on the right and select Sync
3. Enter login information,
     screen then shows LOGGED IN AS :jeffmtl@ 
     log out


but nothing happens.  Must log out to be able to do something and the sync is not done.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

    would like to sync information that was done or created on PC

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

     Everytime


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

     Jellybean 4.0.3

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

     I tried reinstalling the software but the problem still occures.
     Seems to refresh up Decks that I have on your server the first time installed.

1. Create a Cloze note with the following content:

{{c2::(x-\mu)^2}} }{ {{c3::\sigma^2}} } }$

2. Sync to AnkiDroid
3. Attempt to review it.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is what I see in Anki. It displays correctly there. In AnkiDroid,
I see a box with a question mark for all three cards generated.

I would expect the front of Forward cards to be displayed, and the back of Reverse
cards. It is impossible to scan for a card if you only know the back word. Also, there
is no column that identifies if a card is reverse or forward.

If I Force Stop the app and re-run, everything updates correctly.

AnkiDroid version is 2.0.1

This never happened on my old phones.  My *guess* is that AnkiDroid expects/needs to
occassionally get bumped out of RAM/stopped by the background OS stuff, but this never
happens on my phone because OMG so much RAM.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1719 I love the android Anki app and use it on the go very frequently. However, I am unable
to view a card in its 'normal view' (as if during review mode) when I search for it
through the inventory of the mobile app. I'm not sure if that makes sense. For example,
when I see the cards during a review session, I see the picture I included, the format
looks normal, ect. But when I search for the card individually through the inventory,
the card does not the show the picture but seems to be in some odd format (html?).
Is there a way to view the card normally without having to go through a review session
on the Anki app on android? I know I can do this through the browse button on the desktop
version. If this feature is available that would make this the mobile app so much better
(sometimes you forget a detail and want to go to that specific card rather than having
to go through a whole deck in review mode just to find it)!!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1726 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I m using AnkiDroid to memorise some personal stuff and i dont want that personal
decks in my phone. So im changing path to a UsbDrive in Galaxy S3.
2. In first working it works well. But if you work AnkiDroid without UsbDrive it gives
fault and never works again.
3.even you plug your UsbDrive it wont work.At previous versions i didn't see that problem.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Its not working. I expect if you dont use UsbDrive it still works so i can change the
path to phone drive.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I tried many times and result was the same. And please add password support to phone
version.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1729 1. With Anki-PC (Version 2.08) I created a deck of 248 cards (text and pictures) and
everything worked fine.
2. I exported a apkg file for the Tablet-PC (Android 4.1).
3. As in the FAQ mentioned I copy this file to the Ankidroid folder, in my special
case
mnt/sdcard/Ankidroid
4. Then I start Ankidroid (Version 2.01) on the Tablet-PC and when I start the import-function
the pop-up tells me that the apkg file must be situated in the folderstructure
/data/data/com.ichi2.anki/files
and Anki reported 'No apkg file fond'!
This folder does not exist!
5. I created the folderstructure under
mnt/sdcard/Ankidroid
as well as under
mnt/sdcard
and copied the apkg file and tried again.
Same result: No apkg file found!
Where is my mistake?
Thanks for help.

1、I download the ankidroid new version 2.08 for PC.
2、My computer system was window7.
3、I keyin enlish words to the excel and save as *.CSV .
4、Than I open the csv file from notepad and save as *.TXT(UTF-8)
5、I use the ankidroid(2.08) try to improt the *.TXT,but I can't improt it,because it
can't find file.

6.But if I try to use the old version 1.2.8(PC),it can improt the files,so I think
this is a bug for version 2.08.

Please fix the bug and Ankidroid was a very good software for me.
I can use it to study English words.
Thank you very much.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1748 Hello!
I've been using Anki for quite a while now and I wanted to switch to Ankidroid... I
have a problem though.
In the Anki Desktop, I changed the note type [like in the video in the Manual] to the
one with the additional field where you can type in the answer, and it doesn't work
on Ankidroid.
Have I done something wrong or is it unavailable?
I've attached some pictures to make it more understandable!
Thanks in advance!

I'm using HTC Cha Cha, Android 2.3.5, the newest version of both Anki and Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1753 Now my anki database has a peculiar behavior:

1. On ankidroid, create a new note; while creating select a deck
2. Open a list of decks and see that the new note appeared in a different deck, called
&quot;Svenska::Phonetics&quot;
3. Edit a list of notes and move a card to the deck you need
4. Now it looks as it should

I need to change the deck for each new note I create.
It never goes to the right deck during creation.

I believe it started after I tried to edit card templates.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1760 release 2.1 alpha 4 editing is absolutely impossible to use.

I understand 2.1 is in alpha stage, but I just wanted to mention at the outset that
the way the editing goes in 2.1 is not workable. For most of us, especially if we are
creating cards on our android device, we will simply copy from one source and then
paste all the information in one note space, then divide that information among the
note spaces. The 2.1 system makes that simple process almost impossible.

It looks like you've tried to add greater functionality to the card editing process
in 2.1 , but I'm sorry to say you've lost the most basic functionality in doing so.


ALSO, it looks as though even in 2.1 the spacing (both new and mature) issue is still
not resolved. That is, no matter what the settings, new card siblings will continue
to be shown in the same session, and mature sibling cards (no matter the settings)
will also be shown very close together.




That all being said, let me also thank you sincerely and heartily for all the incredibly
great work you've all done!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1766 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Wireless router set to the wrong time (eg. incorrect adjustment for daylight savings
time).
2. Sync in ankidroid give &quot;sync error&quot;. Sync works fine on ankimobile.
3. Set router to correct time, sync works properly.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Normal sync.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Consistent.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1770 No specific steps to reproduce; problem seems to occur randomly, at least a few times
during an average usage session. Very short (but clearly visible; it's pretty disturbing)
flickers of the entire display. Not specific to reviewing, it also happens in menus/other
screens.

This issue occurs on my LG Nexus 4 with stock Android 4.2.2 while using AnkiDroid 2.0.1.
AnkiDroid is the only app with this issue, so I don't think it's a device problem.
Factory reset didn't make a difference either.

Apart from that the quick update seems to work :/

3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The cards are being shown in prefixed order, from the first added fact, always in the
same way. Moreover, the cards are being shown without meanings, only words and readings
are visible. I would like to fix this problem because that's completely useless to
have an app like this. I use ankidroid for japanese language, I would like to view
my cards on android in a random order and with all the infos on them, including words,
readings, meanings and notes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens all the time I managed to transfer my decks on my mobile phone. Sometimes
it worked correctly but I don't know what was different and maybe that was another
version of the app, maybe this one have some bugs.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1776 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Add a new cloze card with the following:

4. Attempt to review the new cards.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I should see a LaTeX image, but all I see is a blue box. I don't have this problem
for LaTeX cards without cloze deletions. This is a problem as of Anki 2.0.9. I have
checked the media folder on my phone, and I can see the new LaTeX pictures there, so
I know that they're being generated and are syncing correctly.

Please provide any additional information below.
Cards with cloze deletions within LaTeX blocks displayed correctly when generated in
Anki 2.0.8. 2.0.9 added functionality so that they would be generated whenever the
user selected &quot;Unused media...&quot;, so the modified code may be a worthwhile place to
start looking.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1779 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Change the collection path to one that is invalid. This is easy to do since the

  I would expect the app to fail more gracefully, saying &quot;collection path is invalid&quot;
and to allow the user to correct it through the apps GUI.

  Every time.

The only way to correct an invalid collection path setting is to delete the app and
reinstall.

Being able to browse to the collection and set the path that way would greatly help.

Would you be able to provide more details about your device and the exact steps you
take to trigger the crash? I'd like to know how you first got a file with that name
on your device (USB, sync from desktop, etc), and whether it works on the desktop client.

Can you also tell us the language set in AnkiDroid and the system language as well?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1804 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Just open the app, it doesn't open
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It happens randomly.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) I cannot tell because I cannot open the app.
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1806 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. It is not reproduceable; sometime it works, sometime not! But when, then is the
problem with the smartphone.
2. there are two problems: again and again there are hang-ups of the App (also with
the tablet, Nexus 7)
3. and again and again, when I start the synchronisation with my smartphone (Samsun,
Galaxy S3), suddenly I become requested to make a full synchnronisation (because the
dates would be too different - but they aren`t!! Only one change, and this could happen!)
That means then, that I loos all changes - here or there on the server!!

Now in the meantime I have the bad situation, that the same files (on the smartphone
and on the tablet) become more and more different!!



What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title): 4.1.2

thank you in advance for your help - with best regards,
Hans

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1807 If AnkiDroid is not closed with the back button, intents targeting DeckPicker are ignored
because the activity for DeckPicker already exists. So if an import is attempted, AnkiDroid
simply raises the original DeckPicker activity and doesn't proceed with anything more.

The error log shows this line:
DeckPicker - onCreate: Detected multiple instance of this activity, closing it and
return to root activity

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1808 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Synching Ankidroid takes hours.
2. Ankidroid downloads the entire media catalogue repeatedly, uses up all data bandwidth
(media is over 200 MB). It says:

Receiving media from server... 
Up: 28 kb, Down: 220179 kb

Then:

checking media counts... 
Up: 28 kb, Down: 220179 kb

3. It seems the entire media catalogue is downloaded again on every sync. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

This happens during each sync since i installed Anki on Android.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

Latest AnkiDroid from 15. July 2013.

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

2.3.6 on Samsung Galaxy Ace 2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1809 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Log into Android with multiple user accounts (Nexus 7 with Android 4.2.2 here).
2. Try to setup sync account for non-primary tablet user.
3. Receive &quot;A network error has occurred&quot; immediately after clicking  &quot;Log in&quot;, regardless

4. Switch to the main user on the tablet.
5. Try to setup sync. Everything works.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Sync account should be setup correctly also for non-primary tablet user. It cannot
be setup. It works correctly only for the primary user.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1816 Whenever I try to review a deck, the screen starts to flicker (sometimes briefly shows
&quot;Opening collection, please wait&quot;) and then it returns back to the deck screen (the
one with the &quot;Start Reviewing&quot; button).

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Happened with a few, imported decks of my own, and with the Default deck with 2 cards.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
Tried 2.0.1 (currently available at Google Play) and the 2.1 alpha4 version from google
code.
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Rooted 2.1 on a Nook Simple Touch.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

I was unable to open any deck for reviewing. To isolate the issue, I have restored
the device to the factory state, rooted, installed anki 2.1 alpha4, added 2 cards to
the Default deck. Now the Default deck still won't open. The same thing happens when
I import my personal decks - none of them will open for reviewing.

I have an SD card; also tried to force anki to use internal memory (with no luck).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1817 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Launch Ankidroid
2. Starting a Study Session causes a force close

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Happens every time. I've cleared app data, cleared databases, resynced, but it always
crashes. Even crashes with an empty study deck.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 

I've tried both the latest 2.0.1 and the latest 2.1 Alpha.

On what version of Android? 

4.3 (on Nexus 4, build JSS15J, the latest AOSP build).


I've sent the crash logs via the reporting tool.


I haven't seen any further reports due to this, and I imagine this happens a lot during
new Android version releases, but it would be nice if I could continue studying my
flash cards!

Thanks for the great work so far!

If I download the mp3 and put in the collection.media it works but it would take me
to many time to download all my mp3, I have thousands of mp3 links in text files.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1831 ** What steps will reproduce the problem?
The problem is unfortunately intermittent. I'd be tempted to blame the AnkiWeb server,
except that Anki for Windows usually can successfully sync when my phone cannot--both
over the same WiFi network. It's actually working at the moment, but has been an intermittent
issue for the last several weeks. 

1. Hit Sync on AnkiDroid, especially after doing a few reviews.
2. It will either hang early on in the sync process, at 0K up and 0K down.
3. The usual result is that it will eventually simply give a failure message saying
sync has failed. Alternately, at least once it crept up by a few K, then failed--corrupting
the deck and giving the options of restoring from backup or doing a full sync from
server.

** What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: successful sync. Encountered: usually sync failure apparently due to timeout,
but once a deck corruption.

** Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It's happened intermittently over the last few weeks.

** What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

2.0.1

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

Please provide any additional information below.
I'm on a relatively high-latency connection to AnkiWeb, having moved a month and a
half ago from the USA to Bangladesh. If my memory serves me correctly, syncing worked
well for about the first month, but began to intermittently flake out in the last couple
of weeks or so. Though it may be entirely unrelated, I've also been occasionally getting
prompts within AnkiDroid to submit error reports, though I haven't encountered crashes
that I've been aware of. I'm on a Google/LG Nexus 4 running Android 4.3.

If there's any information that would be helpful to obtain the next time I see this,
I'd love to know what to record.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1839 Hello, I've tried looking for this answer online but couldn't find it. I downloaded
Ankidroid on my tablet and on my phone but all of my cards are on my tablet. How do
I sync them or transfer them so that I have them on my tablet and phone? If this is
possible, can it be updated between the devices for example, if I add a card it will
automatically show up on the other device?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1843 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.create a deck with cards online
2.sync the deck to your mobile anki app
3.try to study the deck the cards will be reversed

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
i would hope the front of the card online would be the front in the mobile app. i see
just the opposite i see the back instead of the front when synced from online

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? happens everytime


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)2.0.12 online
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

apparently isn't used, because the combining diacritics don't combine.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1849 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Select any deck from the main menu screen.  To simplify this issue, I only have
two decks that I made myself in August in Anki 2.0.12

2. Select &quot;Start Reviewing.&quot;  

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
After I select &quot;Start Reviewing,&quot; I expect to see the first card in my deck for that
day.  Instead, the screen stays still for a couple seconds, then goes black for a few
seconds.  After that I am back in my phone's main menu screen and there is a message
indicating that AnkiDroid has crashed.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every time.  I used AnkiDroid for about two weeks--starting in August 2013--before
this happened, and it worked great.  One day I tried to edit a typo in a card using
the AnkiDroid interface.  After that, the program ran but felt unstable for a few minutes,
then this crash happened.  Now, as I said above, I can't open any deck without the
program crashing.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) v2.0.1
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

Please provide any additional information below.
All decks work just fine when I use Anki on my laptop.

I loved AnkiDroid while it was working and think it is an incredibly useful program.
 If I can be on any use trying to work through this problem, please contact me any
time.  

Thank you very much for creating this program.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1856 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use Tanuki Ultima deck
2. See yellow text on white background
3. Switch to night mode and see dark blue text on black background.

I'm sure this is an easy fix, but I don't work with HTML much.  All posts about text
color are for those who want to do spiffy things with multiple colors on their decks.

I just want to read the text on my Android, and these color combinations make that
impossible.  How can I change all the text on all the cards to a simple black text
on white background for this deck?  

Or, ideally, have the deck use other color combinations that are more visible?

Please provide step-by-step directions, not &quot;change the HTML code&quot;.  I am very much
just a user, not a developer.

Someday, I hope to have time to figure out all the neat features Anki has, but right
now I just want to see these cards.

Thank you!

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1857 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.  On Desktop, create a card with cloze deletion within LaTeX.  e.g. [latex]$\frac{{{c1::1}}}{{{c2::2}}
{{c3::\pi}} {{c4::i}}}\oint_{{{c5::C}}} \frac{{{c6::dz}}}{{{c7::z}}}$[/latex].
2.  Click Unused Media or Check Media from Desktop.
3.  Verify that the proper png files are created in the Anki directory on Desktop.
4.  Sync on Desktop.
5.  Sync on AnkiDroid.
6.  Attempt to view the cards on AnkiDroid.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Since Anki on the desktop has created all relevant media, you expect to see the images
rendered properly on AnkiDroid.  Instead you see an image-not-found icon.

happen only one time?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1871 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Complete all scheduled cards for the day
2. Leave Ankidroid running, do not exit it
3. When the next day arrives and there are supposed to be cards available, no available
cards are shown
4. No amount of backing up to a higher level screen and re-entering the deck screen
will show that there are cards to study
5. Forcing an exiting the program at the OS level, then restarting the app will finally
reveal the new work to do

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- I expect that once work is available I will be told there is work to do and I will
be able to do it.
- I instead, I must force a halt of the program and then restart it to check if there
is any new work to do.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
- Happens every time

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

- Ankidroid 2.0.1

3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

- Not a crash

Please provide any additional information below.
- A minor annoyance.  Whether is it is big problem is TBD.  E.g., forcing a halt of
a program could cause it to leave data or metadata in a bad state, later corrupting
or immediately corrupting a database.  Only the program architect knows the answer.
 For safety and user's piece of mind, it should be addressed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1881 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Turn on text-to-speech in preferences
2. Open a deck and chose 'start reviewing'
3. Problem occurs

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It will do one of two things. Either it will (1) have a pop-up with an exclamation
point that says &quot;Text-to-Speech: No text-to-speech language available&quot; and continue
to review, or (2) go to a black screen and then after a while say &quot;unfortunately, AnkiDroid
has stopped&quot;. If it does option number 2, then going to preference and reseting text-to-speech
seems to help some, but instead of going to the blank screen and exiting it doesn't
work it just goes to option 1 again...


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Happens every single time, either (1) or (2)...yet there may have been some kind of
initial problems with the setup because I haven't gotten to work at all yet. It seems
to work fine without text-to-speech though.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

I'm not sure if it is...if it goes to option 2 it opens up a problem window and lets
me send a report somewhere. Not sure where it goes but I sent one.

Please provide any additional information below.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3...just got it a few days ago. Has an SD card in it.
I installed the HQ samsung voices, not sure if they have anything to do with it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1883 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use Nexus 5 (KitKat)
2. Create a card with a field that has the following properties:
   a. There is at least one Kanji and one Kana character
   b. There are Furigana markers (in square brackets) over a Kanji, but not including
the Kana
   c. Use furigana: to display that field
   d. Examples:
       奥行[おくゆ]き
       やせ 細[ほそ]る
3. Review the card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expect the bottom and top of the Kana and Kanji to be horizontally aligned,
with small Furigana on top of the Kanji. Instead I see the bottom of the Kana aligned
with the center of the Furigana, and the top of the Kanji is vertically lower than
the bottom of the Kana.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens reproducibly, with different fonts and font sizes.

1. Enable the setting not to switch off the screen when in review mode
2. Start reviewing

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
If I'm not in review mode, the screen is automatically switched off after attaching
to power cord after about 1 minute. In review mode it is never switched off. You can
always see the login screen.
The same happens when I receive a notification e.g. because of incoming emails while
I'm in review mode and the screen is switched off. Only that it takes a few seconds
until the screen will be switched on after the notification sound.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1888 My cards have double questions and the answers of the cards have the double questions
and single answers, meaning if the question is &quot;gato&quot; and the answer is &quot;cat,&quot; the

gato
gato

and the back shows:

gato 
gato 
_____ (separator line)
cat

The first incidence of the question is in my chosen font and the second instance is
in something that looks like Times New Roman (serif font). The answer is back in my
chosen font. 

Is there something that I am doing to cause that? I looked at one of the cards in edit
view and didn't see anything unusual (no doubles there).

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.0.2.b6 (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)

On what version of Android? 4.3 (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.
I want to put more of a description so it is clear what happened. I have a temporary
holding deck where I initially put cards when they're first made before they're checked
and finished. Then when I have time I go through those cards and finish them. When
they are finished I sort them into other decks. This is a process I have done about
a thousand times and it normally works without fail but I had one card that was stubborn
and misbehaved. I would open the card in question and change its deck and save the
card and when I looked in temporary holding deck the card was still there. If I opened
up the card it showed the right deck (not the holding deck), and it also appeared in
the correct deck when I looked into that deck, but it never left the temporarily holding
deck either. If I looked at the list view of the holding deck the card was still there
even if I hit the magnifying glass liking short notion to refresh the view. I finally
processed all of the other cards out of the temporary holding deck and the only hard
that remained was the problematic one. At this point I decided to go ahead and delete
the temporary deck even though it's still held the problematic card, to see what would
happen. Because the problematic card was also appearing in the correct deck I assumed
it may remain there after deleting the holding back. However, after deleting the holding
back the card in question was gone even from the correct deck.
I often use the check database feature just as good preventative maintenance, and I
did it many times while this problem was on going, but it did not fix the issue of
the card which did not want to change it's deck.
normally what would happen is I would finish a card, change its deck, save it which
would return me back to the list view of the temporary holding deck and then I would
hit the magnifying glass sort button to refresh the list view and the card I had just
edited would disappear out of the list of cards in the temporary holding file as it
should. The card in question would not. It would remain in the list view of the holding
deck even though it showed that it did not belong in that deck.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1892 Hello,

I'm a developer of the Acapela TTS Engine for Android.
Some users reported that Ankidroid didn't work with our TTS.

So I did a look in the code and the main problem is that AnkiDroid doesn't wait that
TTS is well initialised (TTS init is async) before trying to read a card.
We did some improvement to speed up this but AnkiDroid really needs to wait TTS is
initialised before trying to speak a card.

I did some code modification on Anki-Android-2.0.1 source code.

I cannot attach it here (quota exceeded) but please send me a mail or reply here and
I will send it to you.
Maybe this is not the right way to do it but this might help.

Modification made on ReadText.java et Reviewer.java

Regards,

Sebastien

Happens every time. And also when marking a card Hard/Good/Easy/Again.

Note that I just updated my device (an original Nexus 7) today, and didn't experience
any noticeable lag earlier. I find it a bit jarring now. For what its worth, this even
happens on small decks (about ~50 notes).

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1902 I have been using Anki for a long time but recently when rebuilding filtered decks from
main decks, the cards I have already reviewed will come up as new cards. When I look
at them in the browser though they will have an interval and not appear as new cards.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. rebuild a filtered deck
2. already revised cards act as if new.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
expected output is for the already seen cards, when reviewed again to have good, easy
and hard, instead of just the 1min,10min,3days outlook that new cards have. instead
of the last &quot;3day easy&quot; mode, it will be the interview for the card that can be seen
in the browser.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
yes, but everyday the number of new cards and cards which appear reviewed changes (for
the same cards)

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)v2.0.1

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1903 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create new Type called V1.0(I use french version: Types de notes)
2. Add some cards with the new Type and with the default Type
3. Create a filter on Windows version -&gt;note:&quot;V1.0&quot;
4. Synchronize
5. From Ankidroid, synchronize
6. Study and synchronize multiple times (3 or 4)
7. On Ankidroid, the number of cards is 0 after the synchronization

To solve this issue, you have to come back to Windows version and click on the button
&quot;Rebuild&quot; (Reconstruire in FR) in the filter. 

I reproduce this bug more than 20 times

Version of Windows : 2.0.18
Version of Ankidroid : 2.0.1

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1905 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Since I can't seem to find a way to reset the values, trying to reproduce the error
is out of my reach, but it occurred after having reviews opened and leaving the phone
idle for quite some time.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is obviously positive and within reasonable reach, what I get instead
are huge negative numbers, pretty much alike to the problems of signed/unsigned number
conversion.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
As stated above, it happened once, but the estimates are staying this way for some
days now, probably because old data needs more time to be discarded, if it is discarded
at all for this purpose.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1907 What steps will reproduce the problem?
I do not know an assured way to reproduce the problem. It happens to me after some
continued practice. (Maybe after half an hour of practicing.) And it started when switching
to Android 4.4 (KitKat):
After some time of practicing the content of the second side of the card does not get
shown. I just get the buttons. Even if I wait some seconds nothing happens anymore.
When I hit the back button, I can go back in the application. But as soon as I try
to get forward again or I reopen the application, I get the message, that the application
crashed. Asking me whether I want to send a bug report. (I confirmed this several times,
by the way, so you should have stack traces.)
Problem is there on my new Nexus 5 from the beginning (Android 4.4(.1)). On my Nexus
7 2012 WiFi it started after the upgrade from Android 4.3 to 4.4.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I'd expect to just continue practicing. I.e. seeing the next card or its backside.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens again an again. But it is not reproducable, as it does not happen at the
beginning. Just after you continue some practicing.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1908 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Install Ankidroid on a phone with very high display resolution (e.g. Nexus 5 has 480
dpi). Open some of the staticis. All text in these graphics is that small, that you
cannot read it.
It seems to me, that the font size in this graphics is selected by physical pixel dimensions
instead of the dimensions in density independant pixels (dip).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I'd expect the application to select larger fonts (measured in real pixel size) on
displays with higher resolution. Specifying the font size in dip (the Android unit
for sizes) should fix this automatically because a dip in display density independent.
On displays with a higher DPI number, the same dip size automatically selects a bigger
font.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
The problem always exists when the application is used on the Nexus 5.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1910 1. Create a custom cloze note on the desktop.
2. Make a simple cloze {{c1:: hiding}} something.
3. Add another text field that {{c2::continues}} that cloze, and add that field to
the template.
4. Sync, try it out on the desktop -- works.
5. Try it out on Android, and the second cloze is completely ignored and displayed
unescaped with the {{, etc.

This happens every time, and I can reproduce it with 100% consistency. It works just
fine on the Desktop, but not with v2.0.1 on Android.

This is useful when learning long texts where you blot out some words (in one text
field using clozes), but having the entire line in another field (blocked out by a
second cloze). This is also the recommended way by the manual to build these kinds
of cards.

happen only one time?
It has happened to me repeatedly over the course of several days. I sent numerous bug
reports via the AnkiDroid bug reports system and via Andriod OS.



What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
2.0.1

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)


It would help if Ankidroid would write more often to the database file or automatically
sync to the server. Then I would not loose my progress.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1917 AnkiDroid 2.0.2

The sound playback image has a style rule that sets the outer span as display:inline-block;.
This inlines the span and it ends up below card content, making it untappable.

It manifests in this manner on Android 2.3, but the style rule is wrong nevertheless
(it applied to the older table layout which we don't use anymore).

1. Use constantly the app

Ankidroid shouldn't crash, even less make my device to reset itself...

Happened to me at least 4 times, it seems like some serious memory leak or something.

I always send my crash logs, and it seems this may be known, but didn't see the issue
listed here (although I may have missed it).

Can I rollback to the previous version? that one was working fine...

Thank you.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1939 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1.Using Ankidroid on a Samsung Galaxy 4 phone.
Phone is Samsung Galaxy SC-04E
Operating System is Android 4.2.2
Ankidroid is version 2.0.2

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
On previous versions of Android it is possible to use the standard two finger stretch
function to increase the size of a display.  This works for other applications such
as the picture gallery but not for Ankidroid.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This happens every time.

Given the function works for other applications it is not a complete operating system
failure but seems to be something about the way Ankidroid is working with the operating
system.

Android 4.2.2 has a separate feature which increases or decreases the display size
when the screen is tapped three times rapidly.  This does work with Ankidroid.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1941 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review a card as &quot;Again&quot;, which correctly changes its rating to 1 (&quot;Relearn&quot;).
2. Bury this card the next time it comes up.

Expected Outcome:
Card keeps the same due date and shows up again the next time the deck is opened.

Actual Outcome:
Card is rescheduled as if it had been marked as correct. (Though the rating remains
the same.)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? 
This happens every time.

The same problem used to occur when the card to be relearned was part of a custom deck
and that deck was rebuilt but I haven't checked that for a while.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1943 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start reviewing cards which have to type in correct answer.
2. Whether or not I have written anything, after clicking &quot;Show answer&quot;,
3. Anki tries to &quot;Open collection&quot; and stays in this state.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It should compare the typed in with the correct answer and show me if mine is right
or wrong. Instead it remains in the state of opening collection for infinite time.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Almost every time. But if I didn't type anything and also didn't open the keyboard,
there is a high percentage that this issue doesn't occur.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1944 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Place 1K_vocab.apkg, Ultimate_Geography_Countries_Capitals_Flags__Oceans.apkg, and
deutsch_-_russisch__-__A1_.apkg into /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/
2. Open AnkiDroid, select More-&gt;Import cards-&gt;OK-&gt;1K_vocab, wait for import to finish.
3. Select More-&gt;Import cards-&gt;OK again, but now choose, for example, &quot;deutsch_-_russisch__-__A1_&quot;.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: &quot;Whould you like to add the content of file /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroid/deutsch_-_russisch__-__A1_.apkg
to your collection or replace your collection with it?&quot;
Actual: &quot;Whould you like to add the content of file /mnt/sdcard/AnkiDroii/1K_vocab.apkg
to your collection or replace your collection with it?&quot;

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes. The question still mentions &quot;1K_vocab&quot; even though I already deleted it from AnkiDroid
directory.
After restaring AnkiDroid I also got &quot;Whould you like to add the content of file null
to your ...&quot;. The actual import is working and uses the correct file.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1947 Here's what I did:

1. uploaded the AnkiDroid collection file, media, and backups folders to my laptop
desktop with AirDroid.  Uploaded material is correct with the correct dates and times.

2. opened the collection file collection.anki2 with desktop anki, by double-clicking
the file, or right-clicking and choosing &quot;open with anki&quot;.

The file does open, but the number of due cards is not correct, and the two decks I
imported from the public website do not appear.  However, the media files from the
newly imported decks are present in the media folder, and the collection.anki2 file
has the correct date and time.

anki Version 2.0.20 Qt 4.7.0 PyQt 4.7.3

AnkiDroid v2.0.2

Ultimately I want to edit my AnkiDroid collection with desktop anki.  However, syncing
with the server does not work .... the sync begins normally, but aborts after about
a half hour and about 30 MB are sent to the server with the message &quot;sync error&quot;. 


Any suggestions?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1948 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Reviewing my flashcards on ankidroid - at random, the number of cards left halves
- all &quot;new cards&quot; dissapear.

2. I try to sync to get the &quot;correct&quot; review queue back, and one of two things happen.
1: deck syncs without any change (the faulty queue is unchanged) or 2: anki speaks
of a syncing conflict and asks me to chose between local source or anki-web. I choose
local in order to keep the status of the cards i just reviewed. When i sync from local,
the correct review queue reappears. Until the problem repats itself - seamingly without
reason.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect the queue to change normally - instead, a significant part of the cards dissapear
at random.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It has happened repeatedly, however, when syncing, the problem isn't always resolved
(as descibed above)

1. Was using Linux Mint 13 64 bit, audio on Anki worked fine.
2. Switched to Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, restalled Anki, synced with Ankiweb, downloaded
decks from Ankiweb
3. Created new cards with audio. New audio works on Anki desktop. The audio files appear
on Ankiweb and Ankidroid, but never play.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect all audio files to play on all Anki platforms. Currently the old audio is
playing on all platforms. New audio only plays on Anki desktop.

happen only one time?

1. Enter a text with unicode soft hyphen characters in a flashcard, e.g.:
Antidisestablishmentarianism­Antidisestablishmentarianism­Antidisestablishmentarianism
2. Open the flashcard in Ankidroid.

The expected output would only show the hyphens when an actual break is needed (seems
to work on the desktop version), while in Ankidroid, all softhyphens are shown as hyphens.
This happens reproducably

I usually copy context phrases out of hyphenated ebooks on Kindle, so the text contains
softhyphens, which are not displayed on the desktop versions. I don’t care much for
the hyphenation, just hiding them would be ok.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1957 Reported by Damien at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/anki-android/important$20libanki/anki-android/nim3OtkIW_Q/JI4n5NvMLIIJ
:

I'm seeing frequent instances of AnkiDroid posting a successful call to applyChunk
and then failing to finish the sync:

2013-10-11 23:23:38,346 568     200 OK  finish: /sync/start
2013-10-11 23:23:41,967 072     200 OK  finish: /sync/applyChanges
2013-10-11 23:23:45,786 080     200 OK  finish: /sync/chunk
2013-10-11 23:24:04,349 070     200 OK  finish: /sync/applyChunk
2013-10-11 23:26:21,774 896     
    (another sync started)

This causes problems because the existing sync is still running. The above session
key fix will at least prevent conflicts, but it will mean users have to wait a few
minutes until their previous sync times out. I tried to look up related errors on the
triage tool, but it's giving internal server errors for any operation performed on
v2.0.1. At a guess, perhaps something in sanityCheck() is firing a runtime exception.
It would be great if it could catch any exceptions and post null to AnkiWeb, as that
way the server is able to clean up the sync.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1972 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Syncing a deleted deck between droid/ankiweb.
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I want to sync from my droid, but it just syncs from AnkiWeb.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
KitKat

Please provide any additional information below.
I use AD on two different droids: a nexus 7 and a moto x. I was getting frustrated
with one of my decks messing up constantly on the nexus 7, so I deleted it and synced,
thinking it would just re-download the deck. As you can probably guess, it instead
synced in the opposite direction, deleting the deck from AnkiWeb as well. I tried to
go to my desktop version of Anki and change a few things on that end before syncing
(answered a few flashcards). I was hoping that the system would see the difference
and ask which version I wanted to keep, Anki's or Ankiweb's. Instead, it just synced
FROM Ankiweb this time, which means the deck is now gone from my desktop version as
well.

Therefore, the only proper version of the deck is saved on my Moto X. I don't know
how to get the data back onto AnkiWeb. I tried syncing, but it just started downloading
data rather than uploading, meaning it was just syncing from AnkiWeb (and deleting
the deck from the last device that has it). I tried restoring from a backup on my desktop
computer, but it doesn't save my progress. Instead, it makes me start from zero, with
none of my flashcards' progress saved (i.e. they're all new now, rather than most of
them being mature).

I also tried the process laid out here (https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/wiki/FAQ)
under the heading &quot;How can I copy cards from AnkiDroid to my PC without using sync?&quot;
but that didn't work. It only tells me that anki2 files are not designed for importing.

Is there any way to fix this, or am I out of luck?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1983 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Make a large deck, i.e. 1000+ cards in the deck
2. Put a hyperlink on the back of each card, i.e., a custom link that leads to direct

3. Export this deck from your Anki desktop, copy apkg to phone's Ankidroid folder,
and import
4. Import stops at or during &quot;Import of cards&quot;

I'm not sure if it is the hyperlinks causing this, or if Ankidroid has a limit placed
on the total number of cards/decks on the phone? If the latter, what is the limit?

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Successful import of cards. Instead I get crashing during &quot;Import of cards&quot;.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1986 
When I play an mp3 file associated to the answer of a card with Ankidroid, by clicking
the play button, the one or two last syllables are missing. When I play the same mp3
file with Anki on my computer, the mp3 file is complete.
Ankidroid seems to cut the sound too fast.
It doesn't happen when the mp3 file has a few seconds of silence after the last word.
But mp3 files generated but Awesome TTS (for example) stop just after the last word,
so I can't hear the last syllables with Ankidroid.


I'm using Akidroid v.2.0.3 and Android 2.2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1988 We currently have options &quot;Collapse Deck&quot; and &quot;Inflate Deck&quot;, for hiding and showing

Considering even Nicolas wasn't clear on what these do (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-android/Mkfqn1SS4NU),
I suggest the following changes:

1) Change the strings to the simpler &quot;Hide Subdecks&quot; and &quot;Show Subdecks&quot;
2) Only show &quot;Show Subdecks&quot; on decks which actually have subdecks

My statistics have been messed up during the last 6 months - What i am thinking is
that this is exacly the time when ankidroid 2 was released.

Scroll down to see &quot;anmeldelsestid&quot; which is the acumulated time of reviews since i
started using anki two years ago. Some results come up negative and are useless  -
you kan see it reflected on the graph, when the light green line dumps.

I wish i were able to use my statistics from the whole period, but i fear that it might
be corrupted and the the correct number at some point was erased from the database.


Which other info's could be helpful?

This is not completely consistent. A card can start doing this after having worked
perfectly fine for a while, and without me modyfing anything. I usually supend the
cards when this happen. Only solution seems to be to delete the card and start anew.

it) and try to sync sometimes that causes it
2. It will randomly crash and after that sometimes that causes it
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect it to sync properly but it crashes then when I open it again it has a message
saying there is a major update to anki which I need to install even though I have the
latest version already. I tried everything like not choosing not to upgrade trying
to go back to the old deck, trying to install back ups (it says they are not valid
apk files) then I always end up with no decks left and I have to sync with the deck
online and so lose my progress.
Or sometimes I just open it and the same message is displayed (I think that may be
after crashing but I don't remember as the last one was a couple of weeks ago)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens sometimes.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title) v2.0.4
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version) 2.3.5


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

The method selectAndCopyText() from Reviewer.java is broken in Jelly Bean... I don't
know how to fix it, and couldn't find anything on the net except for this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7581131/how-to-enable-the-default-highlight-menus-in-android-webview)

But do we really need to have a menu item for this? Does long-tapping on the text and
selecting copy work on all Android versions? If so, instead of having that menu entry
double as &quot;select text&quot;/&quot;lookup in x dictionary&quot; , we could just remove the select
text functionality entirely.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2022 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Open AnkiDroid
2. Press on the Sync button
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The sync (in this case, download of data from Anki computer) process doesn't complete
- it starts up and stays on 
'Preparing syncing... Up:0 kb, Down: 0kb' for quite a while (~30 seconds)
before a 
'Sync log: An error has occurred. Please try again later.' message appears.

Yes, every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

Please provide any additional information below.

I've only been using AnkiDroid for a week (but the computer Anki for a year or so),
synced ~70mb over from the computer the first time and uploaded a few times from the
phone without any problems. Made a new deck and 70 or so cards today and wanted to
sync them on to the phone.

I thought the problem might be caused by a lack of storage space or by a poor connection,
so I deleted 1gb or so of media, and went into a good coverage spot, but no luck, so
it seems these aren't the problems.

Thank you for any forthcoming help.

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2024 What steps will reproduce the problem?
The following steps likely require a source deck with certain properties, namely a
fair amount of new along with some due for review cards.
1. Create a filter deck from some deck, using default values. You want the resulting
cram deck to either be all review cards, or at least have some review and some new.
2. Without reviewing a single card, go delete the cram deck (which may crash due to
issue 2009, which has been addressed and will not be the cause of this issue)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until eventually you have only new cards in the cram deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I would expect the exact same deck to be generated each time, with no changes. Instead,
it is either handing me new cards (I don't know), or upon deleting the cram/filter
deck it is changing the scheduling or some other property of the cards such that they
appear new rather than as reviews. Perhaps, it marks cards as &quot;seen&quot;, such that the
default critera of oldest not seen is selecting a new set of cards, but, the cards
have not actually been seen! So this would not be a proper result.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I don't know and haven't tried.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

I was on a dev version, after the v2.1beta6 bump, specifically at commit 482ee8fb7afbbc...

somehow the download got botched or something.

3. Manually choosing the current deck will suffice only for that word alone. Try entering
another word, again some other deck will be selected as the destination deck. In my
case it's always some other deck that I don't use so often. 

This option was working well until a couple of updates ago, then started happening.
I didn't write down exactly when. 

It happens this way every time now. I tried wiping cache, but nothing changed. 

Running always the latest beta (don't hold me for the word, but I think it started
with beta 7. Latest stock Kit Kat 4.4.2 on N5, with Xposed and GravityBox modifications.

1. Sometimes, for some decks, when creating a new card, the card is added to a different,
apparently default deck. It's a very easy problem to encounter.

The error was introduced by txn iss1400-deck-selection-card-editor, written by myself.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)


If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2050 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enter a Deck (ex: Deck N2)
2. Click the + (add a note)
3. The preselected &quot;note deck&quot; field is not Deck N2 but DeckN1.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
In the previous version, after entering a specific deck and adding a new note, this
note default Note deck field was the deck a just entered, which seems logic to me.
It's not the case anymore.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Everytime.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2051 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.I'm working in a specific deck (ex: Deck N1) and suddenly want to add a note but
for another deck. I change the Note Deck field name to Deck N2 and add my word.
2. Once I added my word, the Note Deck Field is still on Deck N2

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
As I'm still working &quot;under&quot; the deck N1, I expect the Note Deck Field to automatically
select again what should be the default Deck Name (ie ; the current Deck Name). Instead,
after adding my word using a different Deck Name, The field for the next new note still
use this Deck Name. But 99% chances that the next word will be added under the Current
Deck Name.
This was working well in the previous version.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes, everytime.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2067 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. From deck picker, long tap on a deck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- The options menu appears (with show subdecks/rename/delete), but as soon as the tap
is released, the deck is then selected, showing the study options, and preventing an
option from the context menu from being selected.
- However, the menu is still accessible by clicking the back button to go back to the
deck picker.
- Ideally, the screen would not go to the study options, but instead, stay on the deck
context menu.

- I experience the error on AnkiDroid 2.1.2 on Android 4.4.2 (Nexus 5). The problem
continued even after uninstalling/reinstalling.
- However, the problem does not occur on AnkiDroid 2.1.2 on Android 4.2.2 or 4.0.4.

- Not a force close issue

Please provide any additional information below.

- I'm guessing that for whatever reason, both mDeckSelHandler and mContextMenuListener
are being called in DeckPicker.java.
- Thank you very much for looking into this, and I appreciate all the work that has
gone into this!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2074 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install Application on Galaxy Note 3
2. Open Application
3. Wait a couple of hours then entire OS starts to Lag, with CPU Maxed out

Tested with on/off days for around 15 days. Issue occurs on the 7 days that AnkiDroid
was installed, and issues not seen whilst uninstalled on the remaining 8 days. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This is repeatable, however, It seems to take some time for the CPU usage to kick in.
And since the offending issue is running within the System UI process, its hard to
say its definitely caused by Anki, other then the correlation strongly suggesting it.


This is Android KitKat, on Galaxy note 3. 


Whilst I'm not looking for a solution here, or for anyone to start looking into, Mostly
wondering if anyone else has seen the issue or knows anything. 

Since Im an Android developer, I'd quite like to get to the bottom of this myself,
and will keep updates and findings here

As my phone is rather small, this effect is actually noticeable and wasting space that
is in short supply.

I have made a few screen shots. The red line is at the same height in all four of the
images. The button in the first one should be only as high as those in the second one.

Also, i think the idea behind this line:

was to avoid this issue. Either it is not working, or i don’t understand the code.
(The second option is quite likely.)

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2079 When I downloaded some shared decks, a number of new tags appeared on the left side.
This makes sense because these cards use them. However, when I deleted the shared decks,
these tags remained. I tried to remove these tags by highlighting the tag and click
&quot;remove tags&quot; and selecting the tag I wanted to remove. This does not do anything.
I did a test by creating new tags by clicking &quot;add tags&quot;, but again I can't remove
the tags by clicking &quot;remove tags&quot;. Is this a bug or is there a way to remove those
tags from appearing on the left menu if I no longer use them?


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2080 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Review some cards 
2. Later, review other cards 
3. All cards are white. But when you edit them, you can see the content 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Instead of having the content
of the note, the card is blank. When I answer, I don't see the animation. It happen
with every type of cards I have. 


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? It is the first time for me and I solved it with reinstalling
the app, without uninstalling.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2084 On my Galaxy S2 device running Android 4.1.2, calls like the following in the reviewer
only end up playing the answer, because the question is interrupted.

https://github.com/timrae/Anki-Android/blob/feature-replay-action/src/com/ichi2/anki/Reviewer.java#L2543

Sound.playSounds(MetaDB.LANGUAGES_QA_QUESTION);
Sound.playSounds(MetaDB.LANGUAGES_QA_ANSWER);

I think we might need to do the addSounds() work in playSounds() so that we add both
the question and answer when required, and then let Sound.playSounds() deal with the
cascading issue.

Is there any way I can edit the card info to remove the wrong info and actually review
those cards properly.  It has messed up the stats.

Please help.  I've googled and search to no avail.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2096 What steps will reproduce the problem?
creating a new fact in the deck. When I check the card type it shows me both cards
but it creates only the recall in my deck.

I expect two cards for my fact. I got 16 facts with both sides and after I created
them it's only one side now every time.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

It worked before but it stopped and never worked again after that.

Please provide any additional information below.

I tried adding cards on the desktop version as well, same result.
On android it even says that two cards were created but only one shown up in the list
and in the reviews.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2098 When a full sync is necessary, even the settings are overwritten so ankidroid takes
the settings from desktop Anki. That's unwanted as I only use Anki to create notes,
so even full syncs should not care about settings (there is no reason to sync settings
after a change that forces a full-sync like changing a note type).

Possibly related #680

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set &quot;next day starts at&quot; and &quot;learn ahead limit&quot; to something else then the default
on ankidroid (assuming both Apps used the default before).
2. Do a normal sync from ankidroid - the settings will not be synced.
3. Initiate a full sync from Anki - settings on ankidroid will be lost.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2099 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Every time I try to sync my Ankidroid with my Ankiweb I get an error when I try
to upload my decks from my phone which screen says &quot;Your database is corrupt. Please
fix it before trying again to sync. See 2131231612 for information about repairing
your database.&quot;

Additionally, when I have tried to download my Anki web onto my desktop (new computer
didn't install Anki yet) it won't sync with my web account. It keeps telling me that
my username or password is incorrect... despite the fact that I just used them to log
into Ankiweb.

I wasn't able to figure out which version of Ankidroid as I wasn't able to access the
menu options listed below. I am using a Samsong Galaxy 2 Version 4.1.2

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2105 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Try adding a note of Front/Back type
2. Upon trying to save it you will be greeted with a pop up dialog window saying &quot;This
note shares its primary field with another note. Save anyway?&quot;
3. As far as I can tell it's caused by imperfection of Front/Back type of notes, which
means creating two notes so that the user could be asked both front and back side at
some point while learning.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I do not expect this message when creating Front/Back type note. I have to dismiss
it every time I create a note

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2107 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use a new 2.2alpha version, e.g. 2.2alpha56
2. Use German or, presumably, some other language
3. Go to the deck browser
4. Select the „Frage”, i.e. “Question” in the second column drop down/spinner

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The question should be shown
Instead you see the tags.

happen only one time?
Every time.

I am pretty sure that i have identified how this happens:

At some time the values here: https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/develop/src/com/ichi2/anki/CardBrowser.java#L143-L156
and here: https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/develop/res/values/02-strings.xml#L52-L67
were rearranged. The translations, e.g. here: https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/develop/res/values-de/02-strings.xml#L133-L142
have not caught up.

In the image the spinner says „Frage“==“Question”, the right column shows tags.

Expected: the &quot;flip side&quot; of the card to appear. 
See: the &quot;front side&quot; with the &quot;Show Answer&quot; area outlined in red.  It never changes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time. I can't get it to run properly at all.  And I have done as suggested, which
is to uninstall and re-install.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

AnkiDroid v2.1.3

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

I don't know how to do this, or I would do.

I would really appreciate at least a prompt email letting me know if this can be worked
out and how long it might take.  Thank you.

- standard font text is shown relatively fast (up to 2 sec delay)

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2120 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. First we need to have a database on AnkiDroid that differ in such a way from the
database on AnkiWeb that a &quot;Syncing Conflict&quot; occurs.

2. Try to sync from AnkiDroid. Notice &quot;Syncing Conflict&quot; warning message.

3. Choose the option to replace the AnkiDroid database with the database from the server,
AnkiWeb.

4. Now you will see the message &quot;Full sync from server&quot;. And you can once again (without
reviewing any cards) press sync. No complaint about &quot;Syncing conflict&quot; this time.

5. *However*, now review one card in AnkiDroid and then press Sync again. The &quot;Syncing
Conflict&quot; warning message pops up again. 


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is that the AnkiDroid database should be fully consistent with
the AnkiWeb version, even after one card review.

Instead the database seemingly differs again after full sync if you review one card.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Happens everytime with my current database.


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
v2.1.3 on both tablet and phone.

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.0.4 Galaxy S2 / Tablet



Please provide any additional information below.

* What solved the problem for me was that I reviewed a few cards on desktop Anki. Synced
Anki. Then I successfully synced again on AnkiDroid. The only visible changes in AnkiDroid
database was that the recently reviewed cards were correctly accounted for and removed
from the review-queue.


To summarize: During the whole time I could successfully sync and review cards on desktop
Anki. But even after doing a full sync on AnkiDroid on both my phone and tablet I could
not review any cards without getting a syncing conflict warning message again.

`Disk usage: 42.19MB (42.13MB media)` however I can`t see any cards except the default
one.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2143 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Review/create cards with the desktop version.
2. Review cards on Ankidroid.
3. Sync.
4. Compare review time statistics on mobile and desktop versions.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect the reported review times to be the same each day on both platforms. Instead
they are different.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

I don't know whether it happens every single time I review on both platforms in a given
day. But, it looks like the time reviewed statistic differs between the two platforms
for most if not all days. There are many examples of the time reviewed being over a
specific tick mark on the y-axis on one platform, and below that same mark on the other.
Sometimes the Ankidroid statistic is higher, sometimes the desktop Anki statistic is
higher.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)

AnkiDroid v2.1.3, Anki for Windows v2.0.26

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

Android v4.4.2, Windows 7

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.

I do almost all reviews (and all card editing) on the desktop version. I will often
do reviews on one platform, then do reviews on the other platform without syncing from
the first, and then sync from both.

Should be one level above in the card browser

On the other hand in order to see details on a card, like when it will appear next,
I have to stay in the card browser and make a long tap.

I suggest to switch both items.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2157 &gt; What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Connect the phone to some Wi-Fi.
2. Remove AnkiDroid from the task manager.
3. Open AnkiDroid.

&gt; What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

AnkiDroid should start up in about 1 second, just like it does without network connection;
however it stucks at the &quot;opening collection&quot; screen for about 1 minute.

&gt; Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only
one time?

It happens every time.

&gt; What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

2.1.3, but this also happened with versions at least as early as Jan, 2014.

&gt; On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android version)

4.4.2.

&gt; Please provide any additional information below.

When stuck at the &quot;opening collection&quot; screen, closing and reopening the network connection
(for example, double tapping the Wi-Fi button in Quick Settings) ends the stuck almost
immediately.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2161 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Use a 2.3beta build
2. on an 18cm tablet
3. and rotate that a lot.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It should be consistent what happens when, for example, you touch the back button during
reviews.

Instead, depending on which way you held the tablet at the moment you started AnkiDroid,
a single touch of the back button brings you either to the deck options or to the combined
deck picker/deck options, a double touch brings you either to the deck picker, or to
the Android home screen/launcher.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time. That is working as designed.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2165 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Write a new card with a latex formula on pc, sync it
2. Sync android device, see that the formula is being properly displayed
3. Change the latex formula on pc again, sync it
4. Sync android device

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Android device should have the corrected latex formula,
instead it does still show the old formula

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

v2.1.3

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
4.4.2

Please provide any additional information below.
I suppose upon sync it is not being checked/recognized that the latex equation has
been changed.
So I would suggest either to check the picture data more accurately (size, date added
/ modified) or to give the card a new state &quot;graphicChanged&quot; or &quot;LatexChanged&quot; or similar.

Workaround for now:
1. Delete the latex equation on pc.
2. Sync pc.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2170 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. With a recent version (see below)
2. Type the answer
3. and touch either the keyboard done or the &quot;Show answer&quot; button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The soft keyboard should hide.
It does not.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

Android 4.3, CM 10.2.
The keyboard hiding worked fine with commit 8268620,2.2alpha83, but it stopped working
with 27f5bcc or, 2.2alpha84, pull request 374.

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.


Please provide any additional information below.


The keyboard hiding is done via the IME action &quot;done&quot;.

1. Went to preferences

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I am trying to study more every day.  I have a lot of cards to study and want to spend
a long time every day reviewing.  Anki's preset amount of cards that I get is too little
for me.  I get a congratulations screen that says there is a way to increase the study
amount.  The above procedure was my attempt to resolve this, but it doesn't seem to
have worked.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

Please provide any additional information below.

Only would comment that setting the daily card limit should be a very easy thing to
do for flashcard programs, and not require technical support, so I hope that this can
be improved in previous versions.  I have seen many comments on the internet saying
this is a known issue with anki not having this most basic flashcard feature working
very well.

It does not, at least not at once. The setting *is* applied (showing non-styled cards)

no crash

Please provide any additional information below.

I tried it with the &quot;Simple interface&quot;, but this may be a somewhat more general problem.
Looks like settings are applied/loaded into the reviewer only when it is opened. Which
worked OK when you could reach the prefs only before you opened the reviewer, not during
reviews, which you can do now.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2231 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Sync on Ankidroid. Don't sync on Anki desktop after that.
2. Reduce your available bandwidth (e.g. have a shitty ISP or set your torrent client
to unlimited DL/UL)
3. Review a few cards
4. Sync again.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect it to sync correctly or time out. What happens instead is that after a long
time sending little bits of data up and down, Ankidroid decides that after all, it
needs to do a full sync.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens often enough that I try to remember to close my torrent client when I'm
going to sync... for the shitty ISP, I unfortunately have no solution. So not 100%,
but clearly many times.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
The latest version (but it's been doing that for a couple of months, since I moved
to a new place and have a shitty internet connection). Android 4.3

It is extremely annoying: if this happens when my available bandwidth is low, then
replacing a sync of a few kilobytes by a sync of dozens (/hundreds?) of megabytes is
not pleasant at all.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2244 When I use Anki, either on desktop or on my android device, two temporary files are
generated as long as Anki is open : one ended in .wal, and the other one in .shm
On the desktop, those files disappear as soon as I close Anki. But they remain on my
Android device. When I manually copy my deck elsewhere, the lastest changes are not
included in the deck, unless I erase those files manually (which can corrupt the deck).
Even if I kill Ankidroid with a task killer, and clean the cache, those files tend
to remain (even after reboot sometimes). Would it be possible to have a proper &quot;close
anki&quot; button in the menu, cleaning up those files ?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2245 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.'Start Reviewing'
2.Tap 'show answer'
3.Cancel with Android's back button
4.'Start Reviewing' same card again
5.May repeat from 2 to 3 or...
6.Eventually evaluate ease of card - ie 'Again' / 'Hard' / 'Good' / 'Easy' 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The card should have the review 'time' according to the last time of the above loop.
Instead it gets a zero.
This may also cause it to be elevated in interval 'ivl' because of the falsely low
review  'time'.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
The frequency is often enough for me to constantly look at the sql revlog table to
ensure cards are not falsely speeded up to zero review time.
Of just over 10000 revlog entries, there were about 400 zero review times and one negative
review time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)
Ankidroid 2.0.1
Android 4.3

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.
Not applicable.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2255 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Enter deck
2.View first card
3.View card answer - media is visible and can play.
4.Do anything other than hit one of the answer buttons.  Some examples:
 a) Dismiss the card (via bury card or bury note)
 b) Use the back button to go back to the deck summary screen.
 c) edit the card.
5. View next card
6. View next card answer

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the card answer with the multimedia image associated with that card.
Instead, I see no image.  No other card in the deck will view images ever again, until
AnkiDroid is forcibly reset, or the phone is rebooted.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2264 Hi,

I have just upgraded and noticed that in 2.2.3 moving the 'statistics' and 'browse'
buttons worsened the user experience.

The release notes mention simplifying the menus and buttons. Unfortunately in this
case it means that the user has to *click around more* so the simplification is purely
visual and detrimental to the usability.

Instead of having a direct access to these options from a deck's 'home page' (see attachment)
now every time you want to access them you have to go to 'StudyOptions' hidden menu
first (unnecessary extra step).

I personally access the browse feature frequently enough to find the new way quite
annoying. I think that these two buttons should be back where they were before (see
attachment), especially that there is plenty of space available there. Why hide then?

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2265 What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Open a deck A for review. Say it has 1/1/1 cards to learn (new/forgotten/to recall).
2. Using the slider select the Card Browser and browse a *different* deck, say B.
3. Using the hardware Back button go back to your review. The reviewer shows you that
you are in the deck B (wrong) but you are still reviewing the deck A (correct).
4. Now edit the current card, change something and save. The card disappears from the
review (wrong) and the counter shows either 0/1/1, 1/0/1 or 1/1/0 depending on the
card type that was changed.
5. Complete the review regardless and go back to the deck list. You can see that the
gone card reappeared and the counter shows either 1/0/0, 0/1/0, or 0/0/1 respectively.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

As above. I like the idea that the system remembers the last browsed deck, i.e. if
I review deck A and then go and browse deck B, then go back to the review, then go
and browse again the system will show me deck B in the browser. But obviously this
shouldn't have any impact on the deck being reviewed.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?

every time

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2266 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Simply opening the deck. Every note in this geography deck has an image in the front.

Sometimes what should be, mostly no image in front but text in back. If the front includes
text, the text is visible but the image still isn't. The image sometimes disappears
when I reveal the back.

If it reaches the bottom of the list, when I'm not touching the screen, it removes
the bottom bar's shadow. I can see it flashing fast. Because of that, instead of stay
at the bottom of the deck list, it returns to the middle.
It doesn't happen keep touching the screen while scrolling down.


Using Anki 2.3 alpha 8, and android 2.3.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2271 Bug 1:
1. Try to do import (add) into fresh collection with typical shared deck such as this:
https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1687853
2. Take note how deck &quot;Current Study&quot; with subdecks is created
3. Repeat step 1 but doing import (replace) instead of import (add)

Expect to see same result, but import replace ends up with all cards in default deck.

Bug 2:
Try to do import (replace) with a fairly large collection.apkg generated by exporting
your whole collection in Anki Desktop. AnkiDroid immediately crashes:

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2272 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Open the application
2.select a deck to study
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Every day I want to study my decks I have to go to :
setting &gt; advanced &gt; reset languages
and then when I open a deck a question will pop up asking me what kind of language
do I need to play ( I am studying for my TOEFL exam and I need the pronunciation of
the words). After that I choose English (United States) and then everything is OK and
without any Internet connection my Galaxy note 2 can pronounce the words ( the words
don't have any sound attached to them).
But the next time that I open the application, when I want to study a deck a message
pop up:
&quot;No text-to- speech language available&quot; 
( I have attached the picture of the message for you)

and then to solve the problem I have to follow&gt;
setting &gt; advanced &gt; reset languages
and that happens every day that I want to study my English words.



Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happens every day!

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2278 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. tap on any deck, even the &quot;Tutorial deck&quot; works after a fresh install.
2. tap &quot;Study&quot; button.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expected a normal anki study session. Instead, phone reboots within ten seconds,
like the whole OS crashed or something. When it doesn't crash instantly I can see &quot;The
clipboard history was cleared&quot; toast and a study session starting, with buttons working
as expected. The reboot happens within ten seconds even if I exit ankidroid by rapidly
tapping back or force stop ankidroid through application manager/app info settings
(which is hard to do within 10 seconds btw). No other app has triggered this effect,
just ankidroid's &quot;Study&quot; button.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

AnkiDroid v2.2.3
Android v4.1.2

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

I'm not sure if the logs persist through a reboot. I don't know what SendLog format
you want, but I'll try the default &quot;time&quot;.

Please provide any additional information below.

It's a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, T-Mobile, I have root and Xposed installed. I have uninstalled
ankidroid, deleted AnkiDroid folder and cleared databases in Android settings. After
fresh install, old decks are absent and I'm no longer logged in to ankiweb, as expected.
I created the offered &quot;Tutorial deck&quot; whose study button causes the same issue. Every
time.

Oh, and sometimes the blue LED notifier stays on after reboot.

Ankidroid is completely unusable in this condition. I cannot possibly be expected complete
a study session in less than ten seconds. When an app crashes it really should not
take the whole operating system down with it.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2283 Hi, I am learning indonesian and downloaded the 5000+ flashcards. I am taking classes
in parallel, through which I am learning a lot of vocabulary. I would like to use Ankidroid
to review the words from the lessons, and avoid forgetting. Unfortunately I cannot
find an easy way to select the flashcards that come up for review in my daily Ankidroid
study. Learning new random words on top of what I'm trying to remember from my lesson
is increasing complexity and I'm getting lost. Not to mention the words learnt with
the teacher are selected in a more meaningful way than the Ankidroid suggestion (although
I realise it's not totally random). Please help me to select the dozens of words that
I'm trying not to forget, instead of giving me more new words!! Only once the words
I pre-selected are exhausted am I ok to take on new words selected by the app.

Using Ankidroid 2.2.3 on a Nexus 5 operating Android 4.4.4

Thanks in advance for your help!!

I'm looking for some way to create a backup or something of at least one side (phone

of decks on a different profile or something so I don't lose it.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2291 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start a study session in a deck containing type-in answer cards
2. Answer the first card, proceed to subsequent cards.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
   On the first card in a study session, the soft keyboard shows automatically, however
on subsequent cards the soft keyboard does not -- this is an inconsistency. Since the
soft keyboard shows opens automatically on the first card, the expected behavior is
that it should open automatically on every card. (After all, if a user doesn't want
to type on a card, they can simply remove the &quot;type&quot; field from that card.) Perhaps
this is an Android bug? Note that enabling/disabling fullscreen did not fix the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2303 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. I am in a filtered deck and go to edit a note
2. after editing I save (via new check mark)
3. Note disappears.

I would expect to be taken back to the edited note for study/review.
Instead the Note disappears from deck.

I tried this several times with same result.  I can find the note via browser search
so it is not deleted but it is no longer available for review in my filtered deck and
the deck count is down by one.

I cannot get it to work not matter what I do, every time some latex images appear and

I have tried completely removing AnkiDroid from my phone, as well as force closing
it and clearing the data, however all data remains either way! After reinstalling it,
the problem repeats exactly as described above. I also tried going on the desktop and
forcing a one-way sync, then doing a one-way sync on the phone. The same cards remain
just small gray boxes.

This problem has been discussed before
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/anki-android/drawer$20whiteboard/anki-android/UPS89D6fmzc/BYMkiW_624oJ
and the navigation drawer was only shown through the app icon (top left) during reviews
with whiteboard. This looks like a regression.

Afaik there has been some changes where code was moved from the AbstractFlashcardViewer
class to the Reviewer. Maybe that bit got lost on the way?

Also, when you tap whiteboard on/off 「あ」 button twice to switch the whiteboard off
and on again the swipe gets disabled.

to China, the app is only available when the internet, including WIFI and cellular
data, is off.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

- Yes it happens again and again. It is inconvenient, however, I can still use the
app when I turn off the internet. Once you turn the app, it does not shuts off even
if I turn on the internet.

- I guess the bug is somehow related with China blocking the web. It would be great
if there is an option to prevent the app from sending data to somewhere.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2331 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.When adding a card, Click on &quot;Cards&quot;
2.Cut and paste the &quot; {{Back}}&quot; field into to the upper &quot; front&quot; box, and add &quot;type:&quot;
in the brackets of the back field to make it look like this &quot;{{type:Back}}
&quot;
3.close

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I want to do this to individual cards within a deck, but when I do this it turns every
card I make in a &quot; type in the answer&quot; card, unless I change the fields back to how
they were. 

How do I make specific cards &quot; type in the answer&quot; cards leaving the rest of the deck
as regular front/back cards? Thank you.

3. After some time AD will crash

It seems like the runtime pauses or stops the app after a certain timeout. This will
mess with the sync in progress. Will have to investigate if the timeout can be disabled,
or if the sync process can happen in a more robust way in the background.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2350 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Have several decks with lots of media (17k in my case) on the Anki central server
2. with only changing the decks (not adding/removing media), sync ankidroid
3. wait for several minutes for Ankidroid to check for media changes.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

It seems that the code for checking out whether there were any media changes does not
scale well. I'm sure there's a much faster way to check for changes. Right now, it's
quite unpractical to sync, with every time having to wait for many minutes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2358 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open a cloze card containing latex equations (either within or outside the cloze)

It happens with most, but not all, of the cards I have that have latex on them. It
is not consistent per-card: a particular card may show all its equations one time,
but not show its equations the next time I view it. Some cards do seem to have the
problem more often, though (usually cards with lots of equations).

1. Install ankidroid 2.3
2. Load shared deck. e.g. Mastering Chinese Characters 01: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/959998085
3. Run through flashcards. Occasionally a card will appear with _no text_, just the
picture. When a rating is given and the card is &quot;flipped&quot;, no text appears either.
See screenshots.

Expected output: text should appear.

Repeatable: yes

Software version: ankidroid 2.3

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2362 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. study lots of cards on the ankidroid client
2. sync ankidroid to ankiweb
3. sync windows client.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

After sync, both versions should show the same studied cards. Instead, while I studied
&quot;1454 cards in 152 minutes&quot; according to ankidroid (which is accurate), with all of
my 20 decks displaying &quot;0 0 0&quot; (also correct), the windows client shows &quot;823 cards
in 84 minutes&quot;, and has some green numbers at some decks still.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

This is a consistent behavior since the upgrading to 2.3 Ankidroid yesterday.

I'd be happy to help with debugging if needed.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look
at the title)
On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android
version)

Ankidroid 2.3, Android 4.1.2 (Galaxy Note 2)

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this
report. That will make the bug much easier to fix.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2365 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open the card browser for any deck and search for a word
2. Press back without clearing the search box
3. Go to search again, but this time clear the search box before pressing back

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
In step 2 the search results remain on screen and you cannot easily get back to the
main card browser screen. You have to follow step 3 to do so.

This happens every time, not sure if the behavior is intended or not but it doesn't
seem intuitive

Version 2.3 of AnkiDroid, version 4.4.3 of Android

Cheers,

Ben

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2366 Hello, I'm sorry but I'm a bit confused about where to leave this feedback. There is
only 1 thing I would change about this app otherwise I love it. Please allow the user(me)
to turn on and off the deck control settings when I want to. I would love to just be
able to tap a deck and then start studying without have a daily limit notification
or having to do custom study and figure that out etc. It's inconvienient, I'm sure
it works and all but I like having more control over my education.

Thank you for your great app, enjoy your evening

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2374 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Make sure ankidroid is properly synced with the server
2. Study all the cards available for the day in ankidroid (in my case around 150) 
3. Sync with the server

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Since there is no conflict sync should work just fine.

I installed AnkiDroid 2.3 three days ago and every day when I synced after finishing
studying AnkiDroid said there was a conflict and forced me to do a full sync. Today
AnkiDroid had synced several kB of data when it decided that there was a sync conflict,
usually if there is a real sync conflict it detects this before it starts syncing data
for real.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It has happened for me 3 days in a row when syncing after studying all cards. I've
tried syncing after just studying a few cards and then it hasn't been any problems.
Adding a few cards on desktop and then syncing them to Android is never a problem either.

Please provide any additional information below.
This behavior began yesterday, happens every time, for all my card types, but only
for this one deck. It never happened before and makes the deck useless to me. 
Background: I'm using &quot;Safe display mode&quot; but it makes no difference. Switching to
&quot;Simple interface&quot; displays only a small box for the question.
I've used Anki for over 2 years, which means I upgraded the deck to migrate to Anki
2.  
Please help. I've enjoyed Anki on Linux, Windows, iPhone, and Android (note that I
happily paid $10 USD for the iPhone app). But for me, this bug is critical and shakes
my confidence in the software.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2390 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. almost completing a study session and then finding that the again cards are left
2.Then it goes back to deck itself without completing those cards
3.Then when I tap Study, the cards don't open at all.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expected the deck to open the again cards for study so as to complete them so that
at the end it shows - congratulations. Instead, the deck doesn't show those cards to
complete them unless I go back to all decks and then enter and do a thing or two to
make it show me one card and then again a few cards are not shown. I have to go through
this process again and again. Earlier there was no such problem. 

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
It happened in three chapters I reviewed. And it tends to happen everytime I repeat
those steps.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

i didn't really do anything that needed the check.)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2403 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.  Run a Anki Droid from a phone without an SD card (in my case, I was trying to use
an AVD but the SD card doesn't work for some reason)
2.  See text: SD card not mounted.\n\nYou can store your collection in the internal
memory too, though it\'s not recommended as you cannot access the file that easily.
You can activate this in the preferences (open them by touching this text).
3.  Click the link, go to settings

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect to see a setting that would let me use internal memory.  But I cannot find
the setting.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It happens every time.


What version of Anki Droid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look

On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android

4.4.2


Please provide any additional information below.

I suppose I'd prefer to use internal memory, but thats only for the AVD scenario. 
As you've determined it makes sense to remove the setting, its probably appropriate
to remove the UI referencing the setting.

flick straight back to your study session. Now you have to scroll to the deck and reopen
it, plus you don't always return to the same study card this way.

Anki currently shows me cards from the deck in groups of ~5.
When a card is learnt, a new card is added to learn and the remaining four continue
to recycle.

I would find it more beneficial to study a larger number of cards in thie 'block' at
once. I can't figure out if it is possible to edit anki in this way however?

I'm using the latest downloaded PC version from the Anki website.

Thank you very much in advanced for you assistance.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2421 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.open decks with a custom font (a japanese one and a chinese one, well displayed in
Anki and in previous Ankidroid versions)
2. the fonts are not displayed and replaced by default font


What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.4 Alpha 14 
On what version of Android? 5.0


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The ttf fonts are in collection.media. It worked well with Anki 2.3.2 but as I had
new TTS problem with 2.3.2 after installing Lollipop, I decided to get 2.4 alpha 14.
Now TTS works well, but I lost the custom fonts :-) 
I'm using epxorting/importing apkg to communicate with Anki desktop. Did I miss something
?

Change the number of new cards/day for a deck, and you'll find it changed for all other
decks.  What this should do is change the amount of new cards/day only for the current
deck.

I (and I expect many other people too) am learning multiple decks at different rates,
so I currently need to readjust this setting for each deck every day, which is inconvenient.

- expected: undo command being executed
- instead: nothing happens


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

- all the time since an AnkiDroid update some weeks ago. Before it worked fine.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2434 I add a card with some colored words using Anki for Windows (color is picked from the
standart set).
After moving the card to my Android device the color isn't displayed.

Maybe it's not a bug, but I am sure it's crucial to maintain colors in the Android
version as well. For example, it's very convenient to use the colors to identify and
to memorize the gender of the foreign nouns.

Android 2.3.4, last update of AnkiDroid installed

What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create deck in Anki for Windows. Style front field to use custom font, per instructions
in Anki manual. Deck works on Windows.

2. Export deck as .apkg including media (file attached) and transfer to Android device.

3. Open .apkg file using AnkiDroid. Deck installs without problems, font file is present
in AnkiDroid/collection.media folder, but fields styled in custom font display in default
font instead. 

Problem has persisted through complete reinstall of Ankidroid and recreation of deck
from scratch using Windows Anki.

1. Click synchronize
sync result seems null after transferring all the data and waiting for the finishing
steps. following up/download changes.

then if i try resyncing right after that it says only one client can access at a time.
so i had thought maybe it was a timing thing or a null data for one deck i deleted.

happens consistently every sync now.
maybe this comes from using Android booster that came once while the Ankidroid Sync
got stuck without sufficient connectivity.

This has been since 2.3.0,1,2 and still present with the 2.4 beta 2

If I put the files in a container, (e.g. .7z), it takes some seconds to transfer the
files to the sd card on the android phone. That's how fast it should be. But unfortunately,
I have to unzip the container to the correct collection.media folder of AnkiDroid.
That takes a long time (~1h).

It would be nice if Anki could somehow handle the files that are in a container (no
compression) like 7z or zip, without the need to unzip the files.

This would also solve the problem with limited number of files in FAT32.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2459 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Trying to change the settings to that I can type an answer in using the basic note
setting
2. cut {{back}} to the front part of the card and change it to {{type:back}}
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I wanted to be able to type the answer in and followed steps on youtube, but decided
it was too much hassle. When I tried to use the basic note to make normal cards, the
answer either wont show up or {unknown field back} comes up instead of the answer.
This has therefore made it impossible to see all the answers from decks using the basic
note type


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It happens each time

It happens every time, regardless of whether I do a regular sync or a full re-upload.
However, it only affects uploading; when downloading changes it never gets stuck.

--------------------------------------
1. Open the attached deck in AnkiDroid (minimal test deck; one card with three fields)
2. View card

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
-----------------------------------------------------
The card notes should be self-describing (three fields: one with clozes only, one with
furigana only, and one with both).
Expected: All three fields should show correctly.
Actual output: Cloze-only and furigana-only fields are shown correctly. Field with
both clozes and furigana is not shown at all.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

What version of AnkiDroid are you using?
----------------------------------------
Tried with 2.3.1 and 2.4beta2, no difference.

On what version of Android?
---------------------------
Cyanogenmod 11.0 (Android 4.4.4).

Please provide any additional information below.
------------------------------------------------
The test deck works fine on the desktop version of Anki.
It can also be downloaded via AnkiWeb: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1123769585

I've tried switching the &quot;cloze:&quot; and &quot;furigana:&quot; tags in the fields around, to no
avail.

I have been making flashcards for study but wanted a more convenient, quick method...
this app looks fantastic but I can't get images to display correctly.  After I had
issues, I went to Browse --&gt; Cards... --&gt; and added the following string: 
&quot;
img
{max-width:none ; max-height:none}
&quot;
but images are still incorrectly displayed! I need to memorize over 600 anatomical
features for a pinned final and this is the app that will save my butt if I can get
it to work!

About &quot;Cards due &quot; notification number, 

(a) When the deck list is being shown,
   it means &quot;the number of the due cards of the collection at that time&quot; .

(b) When a deck overview screen (or its study screen) is being shown,
    it means that (a) + &quot;the number of the cards which are not ready to be reviewed
in the deck&quot; 

(c) When the home screen of Android is being shown,
    it means (b).
    (To be more precise, (a) + &quot;the number of the cards which are not ready to be reviewed
in the last selected deck&quot;.) 

    (the number of the widget is the same as it.)


For example, a short time ago, 
the number of the notification on my AnkiDroid changed one after another as follows.



    home screen (199)...(c) 

--&gt; deck list (190)...(a) 

--&gt; overview of deck &quot;A&quot; (199)...(b) (this deck has 9 cards which are not ready to
be reviewed)

--&gt; overview of deck &quot;B&quot; (193)...(b) (this deck has 3 cards which are not ready to
be reviewed)

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2498 What steps will reproduce the problem?
hard to reproduce probably:
1. have a large set (116k cards, c. 30 decks), using windows client + ankidroid. full
sync from windows -&gt; clean slate.
2. after a while (doing some editing in the browser? exporting/importing data?) of
syncing between the 2 clients, there's a database problem in the win version. I repair,
then sync again.
3. probably after that, the two versions (win/droid) are not perfectly in sync. For
one, I sometimes get cards as &quot;new&quot; that I already did the day before for sure. One
other strange thing: I can press Sync on win, then droid, then win, then droid, over
and over, without ever telling me there are no changes. it always syncs some kilobytes.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

If it is a crash or &quot;Force close&quot; and you can reproduce it, the following
would help immensely: 1) Install the &quot;SendLog&quot; app, 2) Reproduce the crash,
3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2511 What steps will reproduce the problem?

My database got corrupt today as usual (see issue #2484 discussion for context) during
reviewing. AnkiDroid displayed a dialog asking me whether to close it or do something
else. Simultaneously, on top of it, it displayed another dialog asking me to report
an error and kept displaying it and reporting time and time again until I finally clicked
&quot;Cancel&quot;. Then I managed to click &quot;Close&quot; in the original dialog and close the application.

I have restarted the tablet and tried to run AnkiDroid again. It has shown the loading
screen and immediately asked me to report an error. I did and then it just kept loading
- I think it just hung. I tried it several times with exactly the same result.

When I rebooted again the application started properly despite the corruption. Curiously,
the collection passed AnkiDroid's database check. When I restarted the application
and tried again, it failed it as expected.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

If it gets an error on startup because of the corrupt database, it should display the
&quot;can't open collection&quot; dialog and let me remove the collection or do a full sync.
It should not get stuck on the loading screen.

I was advised never to touch the collection files because it can lead to corruption
so I can't clear the database manually. If the application hangs on startup, the application
becomes unusable without any way for me to get it back to a state from before corruption.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

It was reproducible until I restarted again.

The reports I have sent should contain specific line in code and exception type. I
hope it'll be enough to find out why the handler did not display the dialog and let
the application hang instead.

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

AnkiDroid Version = 2.4
Android Version = 4.2.2
ACRA UUID = 87b6eb50-f685-426e-b948-bbf8619ea1cf

My cards are zoomed to about 2x by default. I know this because with each new study
card, I am able to zoom out.

I am unable to view my entire cards because wrapping is disabled while zoomed. Very
frustrating

If I center-align my card, I have to scroll over very far to the right to even see
the card

With each new study card, the zoom is reset to about 2x

All my scaling settings in AnkiDroid are set to 100%

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Trigger a caught error, for example when syncing (access a non-existant property
of a JSON object for example in media.java)
2. You will see a message on screen, but no stacktrace


If you know how, could someone add a Stacktrace to Anki's error message window? It
is a problem because I got last night a socket error and I don't know where it was
from (I dimmed the screen, so I think it was due to Android turning off something).
There is no way to report errors caught within the application. I'll maybe post this
to the other site as well.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2532 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create custom study limited to a particular tag that ends with ')'
in fact it ends with '!)' if that makes any difference.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: Generates new filtered(? - don't think it's an actual deck) deck that includes
notes matching selected tag
Instead: Generates empty deck with no note. Says congrats, finished studying for today

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time

AnkiDroid Version = 2.4

Android Version = 5.0.2

ACRA UUID = efcb96f4-eceb-4e0f-a8c6-bbdc5546fa4e

/!\ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION /!\

The problem seems to come from the fact that the generated search field for the custom
study limited to a particular tag doesn't have quotes around the tag: it goes:

deck:&quot;Deck1&quot; (tag:foo(bar) )

and fails, whereas it would succeed as:

deck:&quot;Deck1&quot; tag:&quot;foo(bar)&quot;

I don't know why there is an added space, I also don't know why it isn't:

deck:&quot;Deck1&quot; tag:&quot;foo(bar)&quot;

Maybe '))' acts like a specific syntax and the space is to avoid that, but it fails
because ') )' registers as the same syntax?

anyway, it should be an easy fix. I would gladly do it but I'm not a developer.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2534 What steps will reproduce the problem?
Reviewing cards.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It seems that the first card reviewed doesn't count to change the number of cards due.
For instance, if at the start it states that I have four cards due (at the top: 0 0
4), then after correctly answering the first card I still see 0 0 4. Then after second
card: 0 0 3. After third: 0 0 2. After fourth: returns to main screen. 

The bugginess is also there but a bit different if there are incorrect cards involved.

It seems to happen every time.

3. Choose a TAG on left side bar to delete.
4. open help, examine forum, search for how to delete a miss-spelled tag.

 I expected to find a step-by-step procedure which will allow me to delete a specific TAB from Anki - at least a TAB from an individual Deck. Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one time? I am able to reproduce this problem consistently.

 Sorry no debug information generated. Please provide any additional information below. This appears when using the online version, and the Linux version of Anki.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2540 The attached deck (with only a single Cloze card) was created on Anki for Linux where
it works fine, but when synced to AnkiDroid, the Cloze card displays the error message
&quot;Edit this note and add some cloze deletions.&quot;

I'm not entirely sure how to reproduce it. I have been able to reproduce it a couple
of times, starting with a basic Cloze template, then adding/renaming fields, and changing
the FrontSide template. Eventually, having multiple fields on the front side causes
the above mentioned error.  If I delete the second field from the template, leaving
only {{cloze::Text}}, it starts to work again.

Since the reproduction steps are (at least so far) unclear, I suggest trying the deck
I have attached, hopefully running AnkiDroid in a debug mode (I hope such a thing exists!
:)

If I can be of further assistance in reproducing this, please let me know.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2544 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a Cloze card with multiple cloze fields, and multiple &quot;extra&quot; fields
2. Create a template using {{#cN}} ... {{/cN}} markup as described here: http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#cloze-templates
3. View the card on AnkiDroid, and all the fields are shown; the {{#cN}} .. {{/cN}}
fields are never hidden on the back side (I haven't tried on the front side of the
card).

I have attached a Test.apkg file with a single 6-field Cloze card for demonstration,
as well as a screen shot from my phone demonstrating the problem.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2550 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Load this deck and open the one card in it. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
&gt; expected output: In Desktop Anki, it shows the card without any problems (both during
learning and as preview).  

&gt; output in Ankidroid instead: it says, that the template contains an error and that
I should correct this error in Anki Desktop (both during learning and as preview).


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Yes, it happens every time. You can try it with the attached file. 


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the

The template (and therefore the card) is quite big and contains a lot of, but necessary,
information. Furthermore, the information is structured good, so that you only see
the information that you need.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2556 I have a deck where most of the cards have 2 cloze c1 and c2, and it worked before 2.4.1.
Now AnkiDroid displays the text twice, once with [...] and once with the answer already
there each time, side by side.

For example, the field foo{{c1::bar}} will show up as foo[...]foobar

The deck works on Anki for Windows still.

Alternatively, this could be related to {{#c1}} conditions I have in the cards, I'm
not sure. Maybe the wrong true/false is being set for those now.

			<description>
		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2557 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create an ImageOcclusion card on desktop Anki using the ImageOcclusion plugin
2. Sync cards to AnkiWeb
3. Download cards to AnkiDroid
4. Study deck containing ImageOcclusion cards

What is the expected output?
Card should display the original image with the missing term blocked-out with a red
box. (see attached desktop.png file)

What do you see instead?
Card displays the original image, but the overlay box is white instead of red and therefore
appears invisible when viewed in AnkiDroid. (see attached ankidroid.png)

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
This began recently and may have been associated with the an update to AnkiDroid or
with the Android 5.1 update.  The error affects all ImageOcclusion cards, whether created
before this problem began or after. In attempting to resolve this problem, I uninstalled
AnkiDroid, deleted the data folder, and then reinstalled and resynced Anki. The problem
persisted. I also tested new and old image occlusion cards and confirmed that the problem
does not occur with the AnkiWeb online card viewer.

Each card in a subdeck should be counted only for the top level deck. 
Instead it is counted twice, for the subdeck and the top level deck.

Every time.

I think this is a regression. I think it was fixed in 2.1 or something.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2573 On a rooted Barnes and Noble Nook Glowlight (Android 2.1), when &quot;Safe Display Mode&quot;
is enabled and &quot;Simple Interface&quot; is _not_ enabled, Anki crashes when opening the review
screen with a message similar to this: 
&quot;Ankidroid has encountered a problem. We are letting the developers know.&quot;

However, I do not see the crashes here:
http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/report_crashes/

This is with Ankdroid 2.4.1beta14. AnkiDroid 2.4 had the same issue on
this device.


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enable &quot;Safe Display Mode&quot;
2. Disable &quot;Simple Interface&quot;
3. Click on a deck to review it.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see the review screen. Instead: crash.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
Every time.

Please provide any additional information below.
I understand that Android 2.1 is no longer supported. I would appreciate help in diagnosing
this bug to see if maybe I can fix it.

1. If we reposition the Cards in Anki (Version 2.03 on Linux) so that the cards are
siblings ... (Order 1-1,2-2,3-3,4-4) The Linux Version does not show the other Sibling
immediately after the other Sibling like Ankidroid does.

Ankidroid is showing me My Card1 and right after my  Card2 - but since they are siblings...


The PC Version is programmed to give it several more cards before a sibling reappears,
which is key for forward-backward learners.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2588 I am using a Samsung galaxy Tab 4 when I synced media on to the internal memory it worked
fine, as soon as I moved media onto the external SD card Ankidroid can't seem to find
the media so I can't get an audio to work for the decks.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The &quot;Reschedule&quot; checkbox is not ticked and even though &quot;Due&quot; was selected AnkiDroid
puts in &quot;Random&quot;. In Anki Desktop, the checkbox is ticked and &quot;cards selected by&quot; is
indeed &quot;Order due&quot;.

1. Sync AnkiDroid with AnkiWeb
2. Reset Smartphone  and reinstall Android on Smartphone
3. Download AnkiDroid
4. Reset your collections by syncing with AnkiWeb

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect that after syncing with AnkiWeb, my collections show the number of cards to
repeat (green number). But instead, the number is always 100 or the maximum number
of cards, even if didn't have due cards before formatting my smartphone.
Furthermore, befor reinstalling my phone, each card displayed the number of days above
the buttons (difficult, easy, …), but now there are only the buttons, so I don't know
when to re-learn this card.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Yes, I just re-installed my phone. The bug is still there.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2637 Installation of the app through kindle-store worked fine. 

Installation of a smaller deck also worked without a problem because I hit the popup

I tried to install a larger deck then. The download took 15-20 minutes. I missed pushing
the button. When I accessed the file through the File explorer I had the message that
the 'apkg' (?) file was faulty and couldn't be installed. I tried this twice using
different methods. The third time I erased the files on the file explorer, downloaded
the files again and watched the downloading process closely on the pulldown menu. When
the download was almost finished I went back to your website, the popup appeared and
after hitting it the decks were installed. 
I'm very excited about this appband will give you a great feedback. 
Thank you for developing this.

The buttons at the bottom should be bigger.
Instead they stay the same size, but the ease buttons get uglier.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the

Exact version 2.5alpha36, b9a59ec 
Android 4.4.2

Please provide any additional information below.

It looks like extra space is added between the time and the ease on the ease buttons,
or above the ease when you have showing the times off.

In the left half of the image the size setting is at 100%, in the right half at 170%.
The only difference is that the text is shifted, breaking the symmetry and looking
not as nice as on the left.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2642 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a card with katakana and furigana readings, preferably one where the width
of the katakana expression will be larger than the width of the furigana.
2. Review the card.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
You would expect to see the furigana above the katakana without additional spacing
within the composite expression. Instead the furigana is formatted so that the width
of the katakana and the width of the furigana are equal.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1.Using ES File Explorer, move Ankidroid file from internal memory to SD card
2.Using ES File Explorer, copy path of newly placed file
3.Enter Ankidroid and paste in new path
4. Receive error - &quot;Collection not opened&quot;

Always - please see below
Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).

Please provide any additional information below.

I have a Galaxy S5.
I am trying to move AnkiDroid and my decks from the internal storage to the SD card
because I have run out of room.

However, I cannot seem to replicate the success stated in either of these pages: https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=2209
and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/anki-android/F__t9kxW5DE

Can someone please provide me with a step by step method for doing this? I'm usually
very good with technology but this has got me stumped. I've tried every combination
I can think of, but it either says it is an invalid directory or it doesn't but still
throws me an error stating &quot;Collection not opened&quot; and &quot;Collection loading failed&quot;.
I have tried about 20 times with no success.

Using ES File Explorer, I move the Ankidroid folder from the Internal memory to the
SD card. 
From there, I copy the path using ES Explorer, so unless it's doing it wrong I know
there should be no errors.

/storage/extSdCard/Android/data/com.ichi2.anki
/extSdCard/Android/data/com.ichi2.anki

/storage/extSdCard/Android/data/com.ichi2.anki/Android
/extSdCard/Android/data/com.ichi2.anki/Android

Am I missing any steps or anything?
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Seriously, thank you for all of your help in
advance.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2661 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. (Spend some time in other apps so Android closes the flashcard webview)
2. Touch the “STUDY” button to start learning
3. Immediately press the home button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

AnkiDroid should switch tho the reviewer in the background, so that when you go back
to the app you see the first card due.
Instead it crashes.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Pretty much every time, when you are quick enough. 

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Import a deck with just a single card.¹
2. Look at the dialog after the import


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The text should use a singular form.
Instead you get the one-case-fits-all “import_log_success” string “Imported 1 cards”

happen only one time?

I’ll skip this. The text has been this way forever.

Please provide any additional information below.

¹ This problem is of course not visible when you use an UI language that doesn’t use
plurals, like Japanese, but probably *is* visible for other card counts in e.g. Eastern
European languages with more complicated rules.

Maybe the fix for #2594 overcompensated and now thinks some avi with video are audio-only?
No idea if this video file has an embedded thumbnail. I think that was used as a test?
In the past (AnkiDroid 2.4) similar videos were played.

(Also, it is the same deck as i uploaded for #2668, and it can be used to trigger #2667)

I mentioned this once in the forum, and the image is done with a build a few version
older. Still the same on α41.

The menu you get when you touch the vertical … at the top right is OK, black on white.
This only happens when you use the hardware menu button. Or rather a menu hardware
button. You need to have one.

Up to alpha40 it was white on dark in night mode. Maybe this element was missed during
the otherwise laudable themes clean up.

(And my quick attempted to fix this myself was too quick and didn't really work.)

Ceterum censeo answer_field esse delendam. If the input tags worked on Android 2.2,
that is.

Looks like a light gray background or coloring the text in blue would be the way to

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2689 What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. hit the &quot;add note&quot; button
2. In the add note screan, select the &quot;saved data&quot; option to see the words I've added
from a dictionary.
3. There is no Clear list button.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
-I know there should be a &quot;clear list&quot; button, but it does not appear. The only way
to erase them is actually making every card, one by one, but I don't need them anymore.
And it's a really long list.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
-It happens every time, I've been trying to erase the list for a few days now, but
it seems to not be possible.

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2691 I elected the notification option to notify when &quot;Pending messages available&quot;, but I
did not get a notification when new cards or due learn/review cards became available.

I ran a couple of experiments to characterize the issue and have included them in the
reproduction steps.


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Out-of-the-box (no settings altered), the option to notify when &quot;Pending messages
available&quot; is selected by default.
2. Added a deck and ~80 cards to Anki, resulting in 20 new cards pending.
3. &quot;Study&quot; the deck until Ank says I'm done.
4. Wait until next day 11am for new/learning/review cards to become due.
5. Observe that a notification does *not* appear, even though, in the AnkiDroid app
it clearly indicates I have 35 cards due (20 new and 15 to review).
6. Change the notification option to notify when &quot;More than 10 cards are due&quot; and return
to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
7. Observe that a notification appears, indicating 35 cards are due. 
8. Change the notification option back to notify when &quot;Pending messages available&quot;
and return to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
9. Observe that the notification persists, indicating 35 cards are due.
10. Change the notification option to notify when &quot;More than 100 cards are due&quot; and
return to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
11. Observe that the notification disappears.
12. Change the notification option back to notify when &quot;Pending messages available&quot;
and return to the AnkiDroid &quot;Decks&quot; screen.
13. Observe that the notification does *not* reappear.


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Expected: When selecting the notification option to notify when  &quot;Pending messages
available&quot;, a notification should appear when there is at least 1 card due.
Actual: The presence of a notification seems to be determined by the previous notification
option selected, and the &quot;Pending messages available&quot; seems to be non-functional.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?
I've only had one opportunity to observe this once, thus far (since cards become due
every 24 hours).


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).
AnkiDroid Version = 2.4.3

Android Version = 5.1.1

ACRA UUID = 964f8e31-aa12-451a-bffc-097308426af2

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2697 Note: If this is your first time submitting an issue, please read the
following webpage:

https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html


What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install AnkiDroid (2.5beta only?)
2. Look at Settings/General settings/Error reporting mode
3. See that the setting says “Ask me”
4. Crash AnkiDroid

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

An error report should be send.
Instead, logcat produces lines like
&quot;E/ACRA    (21299): ACRA is disabled for com.ichi2.anki - forwarding uncaught Exception
on to default ExceptionHandler&quot;
and you get the standard Android app crash dialog.

Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time?

Every time.

Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).


AnkiDroid Version = 2.5alpha47

Android Version = 4.4.4

ACRA UUID = fa28bbf1-3e5e-4093-85da-8409da7acd68

Please provide any additional information below.

This seems to be a problem with the prefs value.
When you switch it to &quot;never report&quot; and back to &quot;ask me&quot; and *then* crash AnkiDroid,
the ACRA crash reporter comes up. But somehow only once. When you uncheck the &quot;Send
error reports automatically&quot; in the &quot;⚠ Feedback&quot; dialog, send one report and crash
again you seem to be back on square 1. ???

		Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2699 This pertains to the 2.5alpha46 BETA. If this isn't the right forum for that I apologize.
Please point me in the right direction.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. create a new card and edit a text area so the onscreen keyboard appears
2. while editing it, try to scroll to something that's behind or below the keyboard.
3. sometimes the entire card scrolls you can get to content that's off screen, sometimes
you can't.

What is the expected output? You should be able to scroll to get to something off screen
like the tags section. What do you see instead? Sometimes you have to make the keyboard
go away to get to what you want.


Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it
happen only one time? It often happens.


Paste the &quot;debug info&quot; from the AnkiDroid &quot;About&quot; dialog below (see the
above help webpage for detailed instructions).


Please provide any additional information below.
I'll see if this happens in 2.5alpha47 as well.

Settings looks fine and when doing the actual reviews it looks fine, it's just the main menu that has this problem. I'm running 2.5-beta2.

We could do some dependency forcing with Gradle if really necessary, but it might just be easier to wait for appcompat 23.1.1 to come out, which hopefully doesn't break something else. I don't remember the last time a version of appcompat was released without a major regression tbh. :-/

		I'm not 100% sure if it IS the root cause, but it is the only thing i can think of that would be a smoking gun. What happened was that, at 4AM local time (with start of next day set to 5 hours) i noticed in the statistics that ankidroid apparently thought it was already the next day. (UTC issue? I'm at UTC+1.) So i decided to set the start of next day one hour forward to 6. Afterwards i noticed that in the statistics the forecast was empty. I figured it was a display error and went on my merry way. 2 days later i noticed that i wasn't getting any &quot;young&quot; review cards. I synched to desktop and inspected the data in the card browser, and found that numerous cards were suddenly scheduled for 2018, some with only an interval of a few days. So, something messed up the data in the sqlite db itself. Inspecting the data, the relevant cards come up with: select * from cards where type = 2 and did = 1403740766368 order by due 
 For now i've fixed my own data by applying the following, where due - 858 sets it roughly to ivl - age_in_days. update cards set due = due - 858 where type = 2 and did = 1403740766368 and due &gt; 800
 It's also notable that &quot;check database&quot; did nothing in this case. In the next post i'll try to attach a file with backups of the desktop and ankidroid clients respectively before and after the corruption.

If you're in landscape mode when you do this, you'll find that the three-vertical-dot menu icon is hidden beneath the Android controls (back, home, running apps). The timer is also hidden.

			<label>bug</label>
			<description>
		On 2.5.1: Turn on gestures and set swipe up to answer recommended, tap to show answer (i.e. touch top, bottom, left, right all set to show answer). Set automatic display answer to On, set time to show answer to any non-zero number, and set time to show next question to 0 seconds. Review a card. Touch 'show answer' button and the answer will be displayed indefinitely. AnkiDroid will not advance automatically to the next card. In contrast, try the gestures: Start reviewing a new card, and tap anywhere other than the show answer button to display the answer, or swipe up. Regardless of which gesture you choose, it'll display the answer for a split second and then automatically rate it Again and show the next card. The behavior for a &quot;time to show next question&quot; set to 0 should not depend on whether or not gestures are used; it should be uniform. But it's unclear which exactly is the desired behavior. Ideally, the desired behavior would be that it would just not show the next question at all - That way, users can have the option to have the answer display automatically without necessarily having AnkiDroid pull up the following card regardless of how much time elapses. Otherwise, the highest value a user can set is 60 seconds, which can lead to AnkiDroid left unattended answering dozens of cards before someone notices.

		Previously cards with multiple videos attached would autoplay all the videos, one after the other, when the answer is revealed. This the current behaviour of the the desktop version of Anki and, at least speaking for myself, is the desired behaviour. I first noticed AnkiDroid stopped doing this in the 2.5 beta and instead started only autoplaying the first video. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/401332/Auslan.apkg (the card &quot;story&quot; has three videos attached so try resetting the progress on that one) PS I hope this doesn't sound to grouchy. I want to say that overall I love the update (the new material interface and auto sync is killer) cheers :D ~Callum Debug Info AnkiDroid Version = 2.5 Android Version = 5.0.2 ACRA UUID = 3f2e021e-15fe-46c1-a133-c20f07a67b06 Moto G

		When recording a sound, if you validate the card by pressing the tick upper right without stopping the recording first, the record does not stop, it is not kept and it crash the recording. Ideal, when record, any key should stop the record and save the recording on the card.

It's also a lot harder to visually compare regular reviews from day-to-day when it's like this.

Actual Result The deck is imported and the card created with the media play button, but there is no sound heard. Editing the note shows that the '$' character is not present in the media file name. Adding the '$' again corrects the issue and the media then plays correctly (meaning the media file itself is correctly copied with the '$' in the name; only the note content is altered). The same behavior does not occur when importing into the desktop program. The same behavior does not occur when the deck is created via syncing through an ankiweb account, only when using the Import procedure.

		onPostExecute() appears to only show syncMessage when a sync fails, which means AnkiWeb has no way to send a message to the user without preventing them from syncing. The behaviour of the other clients when the message is non-empty is to show the message separately, regardless of the sync status. This enables us to give users a warning before an upcoming change (in this case, https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/email-verification), instead of immediately locking them out until they take action. AnkiDroid used to handle this correctly - it looks like it was broken in 82f5a58
