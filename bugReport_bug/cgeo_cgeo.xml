			<bugID>Issue #43</bugID>
			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		When the user deletes all caches of the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list, the caches are deleted from the database BUT they remain in the list view until the user exits the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list and the re-enters the &quot;Stored caches&quot; list afterwards. This is confusing most of the users (including myself). Steps to reproduce : import any gpx file via Stored / Import GPX (e.g. 93 caches are added in the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list) Select Manage/Drop All to remove all caches out of the list (deletion proceeds) .... after deletion: The list of caches (in my case 93) can still be seen in the &quot;Stored&quot; caches list [BUG] For my understandig the list of caches shall be empty after a &quot;delete all caches&quot; command.

			<description>
		The direction of the blue arrow is wrong, if you hold your device in landscape mode. I know that c:geo does not support different layouts. What I mean is a different problem: If you are walking with your device held normally, the arrow will show the right direction. If you continue walking the same direction but start rotating the device, then the arrow on the map rotates, although the map doesn't rotate and you walk the same direction.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		This is similar to issue #66 but I'm logging this separately as this is about visually disabling the nearby button as long as there is the GPSr either switched off or there is no fix. In fact, the button is currently already disabled, yet there is no visual clue to the user. As a possible visual clue I would like to suggest to cross out the button instead of grayingit as this should be more visible even in bad lighting conditions. For instance, it could be crossed out in red.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		It is not at all reproducible, but it now happend the fourth time while logging a cache: After selecting &quot;Besuch loggen&quot; the signature is autoinserted correctly. While I am typing the log-text the app suddenly does not react for some seconds and without doing anything automatically inserts the signature again multiple times (as far as I remember always five times) into the text-field. In my signature I am using [NUMBER] [DATE] and [TIME] fields and my signature starts with a line feed (this is to have space to insert my own text in front of the signature). Maybe one of these is causing the problem. Device: Samsung Galaxy SII with Gingerbread 2.3.3.

		I have reproducibly the following issue on version 15.08.2011: When I use OSM:mapnik in &quot;Live Map&quot; and drive around I see that the trail (Spur) gets disaligned. Example: I drive along a windy road and the trail follows the road at first but after the next turn the trail from some minutes ago seems to drift away from the road. It looks like the trail is averaging to become a straight line from trail start to current position as longer as I use it. However it is not fixed to the position I was some minutes ago. On GM it is OK, I do only see this with OSM.

		To reproduce it: Store a cache for offline use Open default-list Menu -&gt; Manage -&gt; Drop all List is empty Open cache again (search, nearby list) You have two options in detail-view: refresh and delete What I expect: The cache is not only removed from list, but also from memory (at least as stored offline, can stay in cache until it is deleted from our garbage collector). There's another issue ralated to this: After dropping all caches the database-size isn't decreased. I explained it with that it is not possible to reduce pagesize in WAL-mode, but I had also no success after changed it to another logging-mode and run VACUUM. See issue #212.

		I was just using cgeo with logcat enabled, and noticed this warning: W/Database( 1101): Reached MAX size for compiled-sql statement cache for database /data/data/cgeo.geocaching/databases/data; i.e., NO space for this sql statement in cache: SELECT _id, geocode, updated, type, prefix, lookup, name, latlon, latitude_string, longitude_string, latitude, longitude, note FROM cg_waypoints WHERE geocode = &quot;GC1M3C8&quot; LIMIT 100. Please change your sql statements to use '?' for bindargs, instead of using actual values Probably nothing serious, but I guess using parametrized queries is considered good practice wit databases.

		From facebook I am suffering from crashes with the latest version from 26.08.2011, didn't have the issue with the previous version. After idling at the map, my HTC Sensation goes to sleep. When I wake the device from sleep and open the lockscreen, it does not bring me back to the map, but instead arrives at the main menu of c:geo. When I click the Live map from the main menu, the app crashes. And here is a log from logcollector from my Desire. I experienced similar behaviour: 08-28 07:02:35.423 E/c:geo (15064): cgMapOverlay.createItem: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 90, size is 7 08-28 07:02:35.423 W/dalvikvm(15064): threadid=14: thread exiting with uncaught exception (group=0x400259f8) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): FATAL EXCEPTION: Thread-41 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): java.lang.NullPointerException 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at com.google.android.maps.ItemizedOverlay.populate(ItemizedOverlay.java:311) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.googlemaps.googleCacheOverlay.superPopulate(googleCacheOverlay.java:67) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.mapcommon.ItemizedOverlayBase.populate(ItemizedOverlayBase.java:26) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.mapcommon.cgMapOverlay.updateItems(cgMapOverlay.java:80) 08-28 07:02:35.503 E/AndroidRuntime(15064): at cgeo.geocaching.mapcommon.cgeomap$DisplayThread.run(cgeomap.java:1295)

		When I'm using my mobile phone in offline modus and I open c:geo with an other app by clicking on the URL to a cache, it tries to reload the cache, instead of using the stored one. I imported a PQ to c:geo and Locus, cause I only have offline maps for czech rep in Locus. When I click on a cache in Locus, there is a link to the Cache on Geocaching.com, which I can catch with c:geo. But then I get the message, that the download went wrong. So, when catching the gc.com-url, maybe check, if the cache is already stored. PS: Is there a way to see cache-description in locus?

			<description>
		I just tested c:geo on the Android 1.5 emulator, and I noticed there is no reaction to clicking the buttons in action bar. This is because Android 1.5 doesn't recognize the &quot;onClick&quot; XML property in the buttons, so the method never gets called. This is of course fixable, but the question is if it's really worth it. I'll leave that decision to the people who have access to the market statistics and who get the user complaints :-) P.S.: another thing I noticed is that the title bar in 1.5 doesn't disappear like in later versions. I guess this is also easily fixable.

		From what I remember, original cgeo were able to display only caches from a list. Now when you show map into list, all caches are displayed. Reading is then complex (I got a few hundred waypoints stored, because i use offline a lot). May be a new button &quot;show all&quot; / &quot;show list only&quot; could be valuable ( like enable/disable live ) ?

		I have seen this problem today the first time, and it may be difficult to reproduce: I have a list with caches and some of them have TBs shown by the icon in the list. Today I grabbed a TB from a cache on my list and it was the only TB listed in this cache. Afterwards I refreshed the cache-list (by refreshing the whole list as well as by refreshing the single cache). The cache-detail does not show a TB anymore but in list-view the TB-icon is still visible also after closing and reopening the list/app. Version used: NB31.08.2011

			<description>
		Since I use the NB11.09.11 or later, I have the problem, that caches disappear from the saved lists. Reproduce: open live map and save caches shown on the map verify the amount of stored caches in the saved list from homescreen open Nearby Caches, just scroll through the list and return back to homescreen open saved list and you will see that some or sometimes all of the saved caches are gone

		One is cosmetic and one real bug If you enter coordinates with leading zeros (N46 04.005) it's displayed like N46° 4.005 That 0 would be great If you enter the same coordinates in &quot;Plain mode&quot; you always get &quot;000&quot; at the end. And yesterday I misstyped for 1. Instead of 005 I wrote 905. Save it and try to fix it. The dialog has your coordinates not the coordinates written on buttons.

		At least in the compass view you have a negative bearing (e.g. -40° instead of 320°). I don't know if this is a wrong order of calling the bearingTo()-method or if it's the result of using the Android-method. Using build from current HEAD.

		The indices in my database are: CREATE INDEX in_a on cg_caches (geocode);
CREATE INDEX in_b on cg_caches (guid);
CREATE INDEX in_c on cg_caches (reason);
CREATE INDEX in_d on cg_caches (detailed);
CREATE INDEX in_e on cg_caches (type);
CREATE INDEX in_f on cg_caches (visiteddate, detailedupdate); Many indices as missing as compared to what cgCache.cgDbHelper.onCreate intends to create. But this code tries to create separate indices using the same name (in_a for example). Since if not exists is used, later indices are not created. This probably contributes to the slowness of the database.

		got a mail yesterday, I asked him about the error messages... Fist may be #438? Hello Karsten, I am using a SG3 (GT-I5800). I upgrated c:geo from NB 03.09.2011 to the latest revision NB 13.09.2011. After having installed the latest NB, I wasn't able anymore a) to search for the nearest caches (second main menue option) the app was searching caches for about a minute b) to search via live-map (first main menue option) the map showed up, some caches were found and displayed on the map. In both cases the app finally displayed an error message. I tried both options serveral times always with the same result. As I hadn't deleted the NB 03.09.2011, I installed this version again and both (live-map and nearest caches list) worked as supposed to. Finally I re-installed the latest NB 13.09.2011 again and noticed the same problems as described above. I hope this report will help you to find and to fix the root-cause of this issue. Kind regards, Bernd

		We've just used c:geo in anger for the first time over the weekend. A brilliant app (Thank you!). There seems to be a strange issue with GPS accuracy. We have a premium account and were correctly loggged in. However, c:geo consitently gets the cache position wrong by 30-40 metres. This applies for both the compass and the maps (live map and locus). The system recognises where we are perfectly but messes up with the cache position. However, very strnagely, the downloaded static map gets the cache position perfectly (but we cannot navigate on these tiles!) For instance at GC2ZRG4 the cache is next to the main path (as seen on google maps and as found by us). The static map also shows it there. The live map shows our own position correctly but both the compass and c:geo map point us 30 metres off the path. This happened consistently with every cache we did so we ended up just having to use the Garmin...... We are running the most up to date version of c:geo on a HTC HD2 which is currently running Core Droid Desire HD Froyo v 1.7. Any solutions The Sweeney Toddlers

		Sometimes, found caches are still shown on the map (with exclude found caches option turned on - naturally). This seems to be somewhat related to the loading process not being complete. As if the filter is applied AFTER all caches in the view have been loaded. Not entirely sure, but i believe it also happened after the view was completely updated. The caches aren't even marked by smilies. This is particulary problematic when you are moving the map around much, exploring the area. I believe there was a bug some time ago that the found-filter sometimes stopped working at all. A workaround was to disable-&gt;goto map and re-enabled the option (also not entirely sure about that). Could be some problem with already &quot;cached cashes&quot; too?! Regards, Rev

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		If you open the log cache activity without holding a trackable in your GC account, an error is logged in the system log. This is because the parsing expects the table with the trackables to be there always. I would like to fix that, but for a good test driven change I first need test data, that is a logging web page with trackables. Can someone who currently has at least one TB in his account, please open a web page to post a log on an arbitrary cache (http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?ID=****) , save that web page and commit it into the repo or send via mail? I don't really want to hunt some caches now just to implement that fix. :) Alternatively you may also take the issue and fix it yourself...

			<description>
		I can not tell the specific error, but often the storage time in the cache-details (&quot;Stored in device x days ago&quot;) can not be correct. I recognized sometimes that e.g. the las log shown was from 10 days ago and the storage time said 1 day ago. After refreshing I can see new logs older than 1 day. In general the days shown often are less than the real last save date. Mabe there is some operaation resetting the value although the cache details have not been updated. This might be in conjunction with updating the app (by instllaing nightly builds) but I am not sure. If I find a way to reproduce I will post it.

To narrow the error down: When I import a single cache (direct GPX from GC or exported via GSAK) the child waypoint is parsed correctly and also shows on the map. But it doesn't work with a GPX file that contains multiple caches. I can provide you with sample GPX files for testing. Thanks for your work John

 I think there are several things to fix in Progress: methods should be made synchronized because when using background tasks several things can happen simultaneously if the user goes back and reenters a cache details activity for example Progress.show should take a handler rather than a boolean cancelable to install the proper handler in this case (which will ultimately dismiss the dialog before letting another activity / background task use it) in Progress.dismiss, dialog should be set to null in any case A better fix would probably not to have a static Progress but to have a Progress instance as a field in cgeodetail.

			<bugID>Issue #716</bugID>
			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		Google Maps seems not to restrict itself to the range of longitude we deem acceptable. For example, look at a cache, zoom out until you see the whole earth, and you might get: E/cgeo    (11001): cgMapView.draw: cgeo.geocaching.geopoint.Geopoint$MalformedCoordinateException: malformed longitude: -335.1517
 This can even go further as in: E/cgeo    (11001): cgMapView.draw: cgeo.geocaching.geopoint.Geopoint$MalformedCoordinateException: malformed longitude: -560.1517
 where you see the whole Earth several times on your screen. We should fix this in two parts: Geopoint should take care of the modulo operation and accept any longitude as valid when it comes from microdegrees. We should not allow zoom levels allowing the representation of the whole earth as we are not ready to deal (in live map for example) with physical earth locations being present several times on the displayed map.

		From email: I still offering feature &quot;RESUME&quot; The idea for Manage -&gt; Refresh All. After every succsessfull cache downloading put its number (just number in cgeo, not the name) into some file at the disk. If in time of download cgeo is crashes, user could start cgeo againg, then choose Manage -&gt; Resume Refresh All to start downloading not from the 1-st cache, but from last downloaded. As I see it will be a solution for this issue. Every can download GPX file, and Refresh it again and again :) This is something between bug, refactoring and future request. What do you think?

		I think I found an easy solution for the out of memory issue when downloading caches. That code creates bitmaps which are not used afterwards. Mainly I wanted to change something else in cgHtmlImg, so this was merely a side effect (but that's why my commit will include some other refactorings).

		When using c:geo it sometimes forcecloses, it is more probable to happen when I have more caches saved. c:geo is usable with about 50 offline caches, but using more is really pain.

			<description>
		As we generalize the use of Geopoint, we get it by the fact that Google Location objects are not always in the expected bounds. In particular, our current adjustments are probably wrong when dealing with a viewport which encompasses the 180° meridian. Any latitude and longitude should be accepted. Since we use Android methods to compute distances and bearings, we do not have to deal ourselves with wrap around and such.

			<description>
		This seems to be a problem with the OSM offline map view: if waypoints are shown on a map and a waypoint happen to be near the geocache it is associated with (such as a Parking waypoint), then tapping on the geocache marker brings up the waypoint instead, albeit it is layered below the geocache marker and thus not shown. Similar, if multiple waypoints and/or geocache markers are in close proximity the layering of the display is the inverse of the hit-test layering: the user taps on the topmost marker, but c:geo detects the lowestmost marker instead. Probably both issues are related, thus I filed them together in a single issue.

Why is it &quot;Unbekannter Typ&quot; because that is the prompt for an unknown cache-type not the size, which is normally displayed there. I am quite sure, that in older versions the size information was available in live map. At the moment it is only available, if the cache details have already been loaded (and thus stored) before

Also, I tired to delete the cache, and save it again, and then, when I tried to display static maps, I get a Toast message saying it can't find them. Then, I pressed the back button, to show the list of saved caches, and the cache I just downloaded wasn't there, so I guess there is also something broken.

			<description>
		This is related to issue #375: I used to disable GPS to save battery power on bigger trails and while its relatively easy to switch it back on, c:geo takes lots of time to notice that new coordinates can be queried. I wish there would be a &quot;query now&quot; or &quot;update now&quot; button in the compass or - which would be most preferred of course - enough intelligence that c:geo picks up new coordinates much faster than it does now. Most of the time its quicker to completely force quit the app, restart it and open the last cache than to wait for it to get new coordinates...

		Imagine there are several similar caches located in a small area. All are saved in a list, but the names are long with a appending number. So they are hard to distinguish. On the map started from the list all look also the same because they are of the same type. Now during the cache tour every cache is logged offline as found (or DNF) and in the list they are marked. But on the map they look still similar. It would be an improvement to &quot;mark&quot; them also on the map. Maybe an overlay or a slightly changed color could do it.

		Today I went caching with NB3101 7fba2c2 and have seen the following issue reproducibly: I started Live Map and the caches are shown normal after (very short :-) ) loading time. When driving around (with my car) the map starts to scroll and at some point of course an update is performed. At the start of this reload (indicated by the progress indicator in the upper right) all caches disappear some seconds (depending on the network speed) until the reload is completed. After that the caches are again shown normal.

		On yesterdays caching trip with NB0302 I had some problems with the offline-logging. I stored some offline logs (just typed a few words and pressed back). The toast message &quot;Log saved&quot; was shown. After that the following things appeared somehow randomly among the caches: The orange marker was not shown for all caches where I saved a log but for some it worked. If I deleted the offline log the orange-marker stays in the list for all caches where I have tried that After accessing the offline-log again (back in my warm car) and sending the log it gets marked green+orange in the list I assume its related to the latest changes, but I wanted to create a separate issue to test if it is fixed after the problems are solved.

			<bugID>Issue #1115</bugID>
			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		This issue is I think somehow related to #716. If I just continuously zoom out on live-map the behaviour is the following: At some zoom-level (I think depending on the number of caches or a limit from gc.com) no new caches will be shown but the caches from the last zoom-level stays on the map If you zoom out e.g. showing whole europe the icons start flickering and reloading is performed for a very long time (according to the progress indicator) With the &quot;old map&quot; AFAIR the caches just disappeared at some point when zooming out and no more loading was done. The current behavior looks somehow different and I don't know if this might cause high traffic to gc.com ?! A side-issue for this: If I zoom in again to a high zoom-level afterwards and scroll through the map, it won't load caches anymore. It behaves like offline (not trying to load from gc.com) Only If I switch off the update and on again, the caches are loaded.

		I found two problems when editing waypoints, but i believe they are related to each other. I found this in the emulator. Don't know if it's easy to reproduce on a real device. The location is set to Longitude 13,8 and Latitude 51,3. When creating a new waypoint from current location in format DDD° MM.MMM the initial displayed value (grey text) is &quot;N 51 18.000&quot; and &quot;E 013 48.000&quot; (without °). But when opening the popup to edit the coordinates the north value is displayed as &quot;N 51° 17.1000&quot; ! (18.000 == 17.1000?) Create a new waypoint. The proposed value (from current location is X) Then click to change the coordinates to another value Y, press &quot;Done&quot; but not Save. Change the value again and the popup to edit the coordinates is initialized with value X (and not Y as expected).

		This one is from email... So i noticed a new issue on the app. The settings that I've set up is to have maps as the default map source to make it easy to navigate. When I am in a cache detail page and want to view the cache on the map I hit menu and default navigation to open google map to view the location on the map. All I get is a blank map with no cache location. Ok no problem I go back into the setting and change the default map back to radar and go back to a cache detail page. I then click menu and navigation then map to load google maps. I then am able to see the cache location. Kinda weird that it is viewable in one setting but not the other. Thanks for the great app.

		As a cache owner it is possible to let a cache have another visible owner name than the real user name. Cgeo cannot currently open details for the cache owner in this case. Look at my cache GC15593 for an example. Clicking on the user name will open a menu, but it is not displaying the real user name. When I wrote this feature for about a year ago I introduced &quot;ownerReal&quot; in cgCache. This variable was given value from the link &quot;other caches hidden&quot; below the cache description.

		Requesting the needed informations in the Live Map takes somes seconds. It is not clear/visible to the user when the requests are finished esp. in case of an error. If no caches are shown: are the requests still outgoing ? Or are there just no caches around ? With the start of searchByViewport() i'd like to start the indicator, with the return i'd stop it. My idea is to use an counter because there can be more than one call to searchByViewport() at the same time.

			<description>
		The finalDefined flag is not persisted correctly. To reproduce: Store an unmodified cache (without GC edited coordinates) for offline use. Add a final waypoint. -&gt; Cache is shown with flag in cache list, everything ok. Close and kill c:geo (a simple close is not enough to get rid of the process in memory). Restart and open the list containing the cache -&gt; Flag is gone, finalDefined=false. Open cache details, go back -&gt; Flag is there, finalDefined=true. To my understanding the reason is the following: The flag is set when a waypoint is added. Therefore it is correct after adding a final waypoint or after loading all waypoints from the database. But the flag (which was set on adding a waypoint) never gets stored, because the cache itself does not get stored after adding a waypoint. Therefore it is not correct after running a new c:geo instance, where only the cache details without waypoints have been loaded. A possible solution would be to store the cache after modifying waypoints but that may have other bad side effects (like data usage when caching in the wild).

		With NB0503 - 12e87a9 I have seen the following twice up to now but not reproducible: A cache is loaded at the outer range of the live-map (with unknown cache-type at first) I move in to this location and the live-map is refreshed At the end I have two icons representing the same cache: The unknown icon stays, the correct icon on the reliable coordinates is still shown besides it. If I click on one of them, the exact same information is shown in the popup (including the correct cache-type) Please see this example where the unknown-icon and the mystery-icon actually are the same caches. As you see also after zooming in and refreshing by moving the map the problem stays. The problem disappeared after closing and reopening the app. I don't know if closing and reopening the map solves it (did not try).

		With NB1103 I have seen a lot of &quot;jumping&quot; cache-icons (marked as reliable all the time) on the live map. To that time I used the &quot;speed dependent&quot; strategy, which seemed to cause it. On the start I was not moving so the map was filled with the nearby search, then I started driving and the cache positions started &quot;jumping&quot;. Trying to reproduce this, I found the following way: Use &quot;detailed&quot; strategy to populate the map You will get the reliable results from the nearby search (as PM) Change the strategy to &quot;fast&quot; and force update of the map (e.g. by moving a little) Result: Some of the reliable icons may change their position on the map (to a wrong position) Result of nearby search (coords verified with website): Result after update with fast-mode (the multi has moved to a wrong position) :

			<description>
		From Bonemaro. Steps: Go to History view Long press on an entry and select Drop or Move to Other List NPE occurs when the code tries to refresh the list (after drop or move completed) Crash is from cgeocaches.switchListById because app.getList return a null list. I think the fix can just be check for null list and return if present. We don't actually need to reload the history list as dropping a cache or moving to another list doesn't affect the history list. (On a side note, it might be confusing because the user is not actually dropping from history list or moving from history list, but I like the functionality present there as it allows easily taking action on all caches you have found)

		Steps: Load a cache (from search or stored) View cache on map (I am using Google maps, but should not matter) Note that [1] is shown in title bar Move the map around so that the cache gets near edge of screen As you keep moving map around, the count will keep increasing each time cache is reloaded I'm not sure that the cache should be continually reloaded from DB, but that is a different issue. The problem is from the introduction of LRUList in 771dc28 by @blafoo. Previously, a set was used so when CGeoMap line 1154 calls caches.addAll(search.getCachesFromSearchResult(LoadFlags.LOAD_WAYPOINTS)); it prevented duplicates from being added. But, LRUList is based on ArrayList which does not handle duplicates. I'm not sure if best method is to make LRUList based on set or clear caches before calling addAll (which might introduce other problems - I haven't looked).

		Today with NB2003 - 7212666 I had this problem: I was driving on the autobahn with the live map open (speed dependent) and suddenly I got this picture. It stayed all the time and the progress indicator was loading endlessly. It might be, that I had some problem with the internet connection to that time. The app was still responsive and I was able to move around the map. Also my position and trail was updated normal but no new caches shown anymore. Maybe its some problem with the mapsforge map ? I happened to me only this single time and is not reproducible.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		I found a bug, but I don't know exactly how to reproduce it. It happened often enough to discover a few symptoms. Here's what I did: I had a multi-type cache stored on c:geo (http://coord.info/GC2TDT1) I modified the cache coordinates on www.geocaching.com and sent it to send2cgeo On the phone I chose Import -&gt; from web, the cache downloaded again Reference point with original coordinates were added - that was good Original coordinates stayed the same, modified coordinates WERE NOT stored. Only after refreshing the cache a few times, the modified coordinates finally showed up. Maybe it's somehow related when requests for static maps get blocked by google, after you make too many requests, but I don't think that's the case. Anyhow, sometimes it seems that the refresh or re-download operation fails, so modified coords are not recognized. I almost went for a walk in the totally wrong direction, but I suspected something was wrong. Any ideas?

Also from the app gcwatch (with AFAIK uses the GUID to address the cache) the same happens. If I try again with the same link the cache is displayed immediately (no loading) without problems.

		Issue can be reproduces by: opening a multi-cache that contains mutliple waypoint-entries with coordinates (e.g. http://coord.info/GC1TH7Y) selecting Navigate-Map from the waypoints screen change orientation of the device In the changed orientation, only the Icon of the main cache will be displayed, the other waypoints disappeared. Imho a minor issue, as selecting a specific waypoint and displaying on the map works as expected.

		I have seen several posts on FB stating that after installing the RC-version the hiding of found caches does not always work although the relevant setting-option is active. Here is an example: There's a switch Exclude found and own which I have checked. Not all caches that I have found but the most of the caches that I have found still show up with the smiley. I have gone into these caches and they were logged by me. When I first look at the screen they are not there but a few seconds later (about 10) they show up. I notice as i zoom in or out is when this happens. Hope this helps. I can not reproduce this by myself. Is it possible that this problem appears when upgrading from market-version to RC-version only for some reason ?

			<description>
		Today while collecting solved mysteries with the newest RC I have seen the following problem: I stored caches on my list containing modified coords from the website. The stored cache information is correct (WP for original coords, cache at modified coords). When I map the location or open the live map the cache is sometimes shown at the original coords instead of the modified coords. I suspect it is an issue with merging the data coming from the map with the offline data from the DB.

		From email: Hello, There were some functions working in the previous revisions, which are not working now (02.04.2012 revision). Issue: updating stored cache lists not working properly. Start program - Stored - (a stored list of caches opens) - Menu - Manage - Refresh All. It supposingly refreshes the stored list. If I logged my cache as &quot;found&quot; using my PC computer, this function used to add a green vertical line next to the cache name and add a &quot;smiley&quot;. Now it does not do it. It does not update the cache status to &quot;found&quot;, either. It refreshes the logs, but that's it. Start program - Stored - (a stored list of caches opens) - Menu - Select mode - (selecting a few caches) - Menu - Manage - Refresh selected. Same story as above. No green line, no &quot;smiley&quot;, no &quot;found&quot; status on the cache main description page. However, after entering (&quot;clicking on&quot;) the stored cache main page and hitting the &quot;refresh&quot; button, the cache status is updated to &quot;found&quot; and after leaving back to the stored list, the green line is back and the &quot;smiley&quot; (on the map) as well at this cache only. Please, fix.

		If a map view is restarted after having been removed from memory and the map provider has changed, the location and zoom information are lost because they are not stored in the Bundle.

		If you add a cache to your watchlist from the cache details activity, it will be put in your watchlist on the server and displayed as such on your device. However, if you go back to the cache list activity and reenter the cache details activity for the same cache, it will say that your cache is not in your watchlist while it is.

		Since some weeks in the NBs the popup from live map is closed right after selecting &quot;Save&quot;. (It seems the saving is now done in the background). Thats quite OK, because it does not block the app during the cache download. However the icon of the cache to be saved is not updated afterwards. It stays marked unreliable, does not &quot;jump&quot; to the precise coordinates and the disk-overlay is not shown. You have to close and reopen or reload the map to make the change visible. @rsudev: That's the issue I talked about on IRC some days ago.

		While testing the new mapsforge implementation I have seen the following problem: Select offline map v0.3.0 (did not test 0.2.4) for usage in c:geo Reboot device (so that c:geo for sure is not active) Disable all internet-access Start c:geo Select Live Map No map is shown only empty background. After enabling network access again the map is loaded and keeps loading although I disabled network again afterwards. This is NOT a problem of fallback to online map, because once the map is shown I can disable network again and can still pan around on the map through germany.

			<description>
		This morning my battery was at 100% and I haven't opened c:geo a single time. GPS has been disabled all day. After about 9 hours my battery is down to 56% and Android says that c:geo is responsible for 97% of that (battery usage screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/wMjhd.png, detailed battery graph: http://i.imgur.com/Nmb0c.png) The &quot;Use details&quot; for c:geo have Keep Awake at 1 second, which is clearly not right. You can see that my phone has not gone to sleep at all in this period. Phone is a T-Mobile G2 running CyanogenMod 7.2.0-RC0. It's the build that somebody made to fix the voicemail notification error, but I can test with a standard build or different ROM if necessary.

		Using the latest build with mapsforge 0.3 offline map. Steps: Display the offline map Zoom in until the scale is 60m (200ft) or less Change the map source to Mapnik OSM maps You will get blank map and no tiles will ever load. If you look at the log, you will eventually see TileDownloader: java.io.FileNotFoundException: http://tile.openstreetmap.org/19/465485/206885.png The problem is that c-geo is trying to download tiles at a higher zoom level than is available from the website. I believe this is caused by reusing the mapView and mapController when the map source is changed.

		We got support mails telling, that the &quot;Add to calendar&quot; option is not shown for some event caches. I can reproduce that with the NB and market-version. Some are working (GC3G86R) some not (GC3D6YH). Both events are in the future. What I can see additionally is, that the event-date is not shown in cache-details for the non-working case. That -I guess- will be the main problem.

		Found with RC-version 2012.05.30-RC-dd31d83. Test with first RC-version will follow: We have the known limitation that owned caches are identified as multi caches by the PNG-parsing. This is no big deal, but it allows to track the following problem: Strategy: Speed dependent (in stationary environment -&gt; Nearby search used) User: PM After loading has finished the owned caches are well identified (by nearby search): Zooming out a reload takes place and the owned caches change their type to multi and owned marker is gone: I guess this is not limited to owned caches, but due to the limitation in parsing mentioned above it most likely to happen with owned caches. It seems information from nearby result is merged wrong with map parsing results.

However, when the direction is adjusted for the phone orientation through Compatibility#getDirectionNow(), a value as large as 270 may be added. This might be the cause (or one of the causes) of the problems recently discovered with the compass.

		If the List &quot;All&quot; is opened while importing caches with send2c:geo the imported caches will not show up in any list except in the new &quot;All&quot; list.

Perhaps should be moved automatically into another list, if you download them while beeing in the &quot;All&quot; list. Keep up the good work! Best regards, Kratergecko

		With the market release (as well as NBs) the functionality of the limit for waypoints showing on the live map is working almost good, but on some occasions it is not working. I can not clearly reproduce this but it is something like this scenario: Live map is running while driving around A saved cache with waypoints is coming in range The count of caches on live map is below my configured limit (in this case: 20) and the WPs are shown The live map keeps periodically loading Suddenly the WPs disappear although the count of caches is still below the limit Closing and reopening live map makes the WPs reappear in this case Set &quot;Unverified&quot; because the described steps are not always reproducible for me.

		Due to the same logic that causes #1757, often Store Offline in the Live Map is disabled when it should not be. The cause is the check app.hasUnsavedCaches(lastSearchResult) used when checking to disable or not. lastSearchResult could be empty with the new live map, but caches still shown on screen. The check should be made against caches in the viewport. I should be able to tackle this one as well.

		If I do a search using a place name, it brings up a list of the caches. If I then map that location I can see where they are. From that screen, if I choose Store for Offline, nothing happens. If I return to the list view and do it from there, no problem. Still a great app. Thanks.

		With version 2012.06.29-NB-fd3eda7 I found this (but it is probably present longer time): Don't hide found caches Open live map (Strategy: Fast) Click on a found cache loaded by live map (Type: ??, Marked found, Unreliable) Popup opens but does not report it as &quot;Found&quot; Close popup The map now displays the correct cache type but the found marker (smiley) is no longer shown The popup from live map on geocaching.com (where we retrieve the info for our popup) is not indicating whether the cache is found by the user. This means c:geo can not get new information on found-status and thus should not overwrite the found-info in case the popup is opened.

		Found in current master: Be sure &quot;Hide own/found &quot;is active Open live map and wait till loading is complete Only unfound caches are displayed Close live map Go to settings and deactivate &quot;Hide own/found&quot; Open live map again Still only unfound caches are displayed I think this is an issue of &quot;caching&quot; data, because if I move the map afterwards so that an update is triggered it works as designed. Only the initial data after opening the map is not updated as long as c:geo is running. So this is no major issue but just a glitch, however it is happening to me quite often if I am out caching and just want to quickly check which found caches are nearby.

		From support email: It would be nice, if there were a counter somewhere, to show me how many caches I mark as found the offline-log function. When I am on a cache tour with 30 or more cache on one day, I am not able to count them all by myself. I can use the filter for showing all caches with a saved log, but there is still the number off all caches in the list showing. May you have an idea.

		In a recent commit the luve mode of the map was changed to remember the last setting or something similar. Now I see the following behaviour: Open live map (live is enabled) Close live map and go to lists open a cache and select navigate map Map opens with live mode disabled (which is ok for me) Go back to main screen and go to live map Live mode is now disabled This is a changed behaviou which might users think, that the live map is not working. I suggest to enable live by defaukt if the map is started from main screen. Sent via Hubroid

		With current nightly I had the following problem today: A cache was stored on my device I updated the personal note on the website I updated the cache in c:geo afterwards Result: In &quot;Creating view&quot; c:geo freezes After timeout Android reports &quot;c:geo stopped&quot; and returns to the main menu Its not reproducible. My subjective impression is, that it has something to with the content of the personal note. Without personal note I did 10 consecutive updates without problem, after entering a personal note it appears sometimes.

			<description>
		This feature used to work and it was useful to use &quot;refresh all&quot; on caches that were cached for a longer time and then just abort the process, when you've reached a point that all caches were reasonably fresh. Now, I don't know from which update (i'm using nightly builds) this method wasn't working properly anymore, but sort still works and refresh all still does, but caches stored for a longer time are not picked first. Also using refresh all on a large number of caches stops by it self somewhere in the process, it is not dependant on wifi sleep policy or screen sleep - I tried running it plugged in to usb and wifi and screen do not power off when plugged in.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		Hi, I recently installed this app on my phone (Galaxy Blaze 4g) which was running ICS 4.0.4 and it is great, however the compass is really messed up. I can basically make the compass spin by tilting the phone back and forward. If I let it &quot;stabilize&quot; when the phone is on a flat surface (screen facing up or down), it is showing North, where East is. If I keep the phone in my hand in front of my face, North is pointing to about where South is. I updated to 4.1.2 yesterday and the issue remains. As a reference, GPS Status is also going crazy and the author confirmed that he's using a deprecated api because of android 2.2 which has problems with Android 4.0+ Smart Compass (part of Smart Tools) on the other hand, works like a charm when compared to a real compass. Of course, in GPS only mode, things work fine, but need some movement to detect the direction so it makes it more tricky once I get close to a cache :). I'll be happy to provide more data, if you guys let me know what you need. Regards, Georgi

		I played with the new image gallery tab in the recent nightly builds. While it is working normal and stable on my SGS2 (Android 4.0.4) it is really unstable on my tablet (TF700T with Android 4.1). On the tablet sometimes the app crashes while downloading the images. It is not clearly reproducible, but e.g.: Open cache GC12C15 Swipe to image tab Images are loaded OK on the first try (after starting the app) Go back to main menu Open cache details again Swipe to image tab The app crashes while on the progress of loading the pictures Unfortunately I still have to learn how to take a log on Jelly Bean...so no log available for now. Due to the experiences in the past I would assume it is an out of memory problem again. Can someone elese with a tablet (high res display) test this a little bit and try to take a log (or can someone link me a detailed description of how to take a log on Jelly Bean devices) ?

		I just had a NPE in CacheDetailsActivity, line 2083. I'm quite sure I've seen an issue (or stack trace) for that one before, but I can't find anymore. Anyhow, I think I now understand that NPE. The &quot;view&quot; field in the LoadDescriptionTask suddenly is null. To my mind, this happens if &quot;notifyDataSetChanged&quot; is called while some parallel task is running (like the loading of the long description). We do reset the views of all details views in the details view activity when a notifyDataSetChanged occurs, so this might also lead to problems with other parallel access to the views.

			<description>
		Tested with four caches (not my own) and they all don't have a link to spoiler in the cache description. This seems to affect also stored caches with the newest nightly. I am quite sure, that these stored caches had the spoiler link and picture available but now it is gone (cache was not updated). So I guess it is rather not a problem with the recent site-update but a problem within c:geo which came in recently.

		I would assume it has to do with the recent changes but I could not yet start to analyze it. It seems, that if I refresh a stored cache the waypoints defined in the cache get added again on every refresh. Furthermore, if a waypoint is removed from the cache description, the related stored waypoint(s) are not deleted from the stored cache

		Using my tablet (Asus Transformer TF700T Infinity, Android 4.1.1) non of the OSM-maps (neither online nor offline) are working. If I select the map while on live map c:geo crashes. From that point on it keeps crashing anytime I want to access the map (live or from list). The only way back is to change the map back to Google in settings. Unfortunately I am unable to take a log at the moment (because of 4.1.1). Everything is working normal on my phone and on a TF101T tablet , so my first guess would be that the higher resolution of the TF700T (1900x1200) is causing this.

		Since I've updated my Google Nexus 7 tablet from 4.1.2 to the official Android 4.2 release this week c:geo crashes every time I switch from Google Online Map to OSM Offline/Online map. Let's be clearer: I can open a OSM map and I am able to zoom in or out for more or less detail but when I try to move the map to change the position the application is crashing every time. I tried both maps version 0.3.0 and 0.2.4. It was working fine with Android 4.1. Thanks a lot, Vikala2011

		Depending on the system timezone, the ExportTest may fail. This is because the formatting of the SimpleDateFormat depends on the timezone used for &quot;interpretation&quot; of the millisecondsSince1970 value, as documented in the sample code of http://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html Now we can fix the test by adding static {
    fieldNoteDateFormat.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;UTC&quot;));
}
 and editing the expected output. But before doing that, I would like to know if someone knows how GC interprets the timezone of field note exports. Because if they use a timezone different to UTC, it might make more sense to use that one for the date format (but still leave the output format on Zulu time).

		In the last version (2012.12.03) of c:geo I have a problem with the visibility of caches on the live map. I activated the setting: &quot;Exclude own and found caches&quot;, but it only works, if I am in the &quot;live-mode&quot; (live map &gt; menu &gt; &quot;enable live&quot;). If I disable the &quot;live-mode&quot; (live map &gt; menu &gt; &quot;disable live&quot;) all caches are visible. On swapping the &quot;live-mode&quot; the view gets instantly updated with the correct/incorrect results. Anyone else experiencing this problems? Any questions I left open?

			<description>
		I experienced a problem a couple of weeks ago which I wanted to share. I'm not certain, but here it is anyway: My login name on the GC.com site has some capital letters. On my device, I had entered my login name all in lowercase. I had 'found' some caches through the device, and these then immediately displayed the smiley icon. I later 'found' a cache through the GC.com site. I wanted to pull down the 'finding' of the cache onto the device, to get the smiley icon on the live map. However, when I used the 'refresh' option on the cache, it still didn't show as found. I tried several times with no success. It seemed as though the login name was case-sensitive as after I changed the name to have the same capitalisation on the device as on GC.com, then on the next refresh it picked up that it was a 'find'. I'm surprised if this is due to case sensitivity. Perhaps it was due to some other setting I had also changed, but it seemed for me that capitalising my login name correctly was what fixed it.

		I am not sure how this was before the recent changes on gc.com. Can someone check whether we have been able to detect PM-caches from search results before ? I can see in c:geo that when doing a nearby search premium-member caches are not identified as such. That leads to the problem (reported on facebook) that the &quot;All Member Access&quot; filter is useless in this case. Comparing with the website search results I can see that there is a (new) icon which indicates PM-status. I don't know whether this was in form of text before... Sadly this icon is sometimes displaced by other icons for that cache (e.g. Has TB, Needs Maintenance).

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		When caches are imported via GPX, they are not marked as being owned by current user. Initial discussion can be found in #2304. Options as presented by Bananeweizen: A) Move the call to setOwn() from GCParser, line 377 into the cgCache.setOwnerUserId method. Then &gt;the flag would automatically be set when the user id of the cache is set, independent of how the cache &gt;was created (GC parsing, GPX...). That's an improvement as the flag and the user id are then always in &gt;sync during parsing. B) Remove the own flag completely. Instead make cgCache.own a calculated property, for which the &gt;cache asks its connector. The flag and the user name are then always in sync, independent of &gt;changing the user name in the app. Option B sounds best to me.

		We do not support multi-user mode (tablets running Android 4.2+), because in multi-user mode each user gets their own directories (accessible through Context.getFilesDir() or Context.getExternalFilesDir()) while we build the paths using Environment.getDataDirectory() and Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(). The path we use corresponds to the primary user (for example /data/data/cgeo.geocaching), which is unaccessible by other users. The right path to use for some other user might look like data/user/10/cgeo.geocaching and will be obtained through the proper API calls. If this issue is a duplicate of an existing issue, please mark the other one as a duplicate and keep this one as a reference on the problem.

		I am not sure if this is a new bug (since the change of the ownership icon) we never supported it It was already in for a long time Procedure: Be sure to have non of your owned caches saved or cached Perform nearby search where one of the results is a cache owned by yourself Start logging view for your owned cache directly from result by long press on the cache Result: You will see that only the default log types but not the owner specific log type are shown Only if you open the cache details the owner logs are available (Deactivate, Archive,..) This probably means one of the following: The nearby search parsing does not return the ownership status since the change. We did never parse it from search results Its a bug elsewhere in the code that when accessing the log view from list the log types are not shown

		The last few days I am often experiencing that on startup of c:geo an empty notification box is shown for some seconds. After some seconds it either shows me, that a new nightly is available or just disappears (in case the newest nightly is installed). I am quite sure, that with older versions the box was never shown when empty but only visible together with a notification. Did something change in the code with respect to the notification ?

		When rotating the device while on any of the cache detail pages (Waypoint, Description, Logbook,...) the view jumps back to the details page but the footer still indicates the page which was active before rotating the device. So, two problems here: In the ideal case the view should not be reset when rotating but stay on the active page The footer should be aligned Example: Logbook was active in landscape and I rotated the device. Now the details-page is shown but it is still labeled &quot;Logbook&quot;.

		A user reported on our support mail, that the log text on geocaching.com is limited to 4000 chars. Unfortunately it seems c:geo does not limit the log text to 400 chars. If a user in c:geo sends a log with &gt;4000 chars c:geo reports it as sucessfully logged but transmission to the website is not sucessful in this case, thus the cache is not logged. I did not try this but the report from the user sounds reasonable.

		Hi, I'm using self compiled version (now it is same as yesterdays master) and I have discovered one inconsistency (I don't know if it is regression or not, never noticed before). When you create field note (just by log offline -&gt; Found) from list, active map popup, cache details ... it works correctly, but when you try to submit that field note ... Log visit offline -&gt; log visit -&gt; (loggging window) -&gt; Send log button it depends where you start this sequence ... when it is started from cache detail activity it is ok ... it deletes associated field note (cache is not visible in list where you put filter status-&gt;offline log prepared) if it is started from list (long press) or map (cache popup) it sends log online, but never removes that associated field note additionally - field note is not clearable in that case by clicking on clear in offline logging menu

 Trying again (with other caches on list) the problem was not reproducible. Possibly linked to #1350 or #1899. The FCs with &quot;Concurrent Modification Exception&quot; tended towards 0 in the last months.. so I guess the general problem of different sources changing the data is mainly solved but it seems this is a special case. I am sure that no background action was running (such as saving a cache, etc.).

		When having oc.de loading active this is a result of the nearby search: The setting &quot;Hide disabled caches&quot; was turned off to that time. Having &quot;Hide disabled caches&quot; activated I get the following output: I am quite sure, that this once worked after initial implementation. It seems the flags for &quot;archived&quot; and &quot;disabled&quot; got somehow mixed up or misinterpreted. In my opinion &quot;Archived&quot; should not be returned in any case, and &quot;Disabled&quot; should only be displayed if the mentioned setting is not active.

		Today I did some spontaneous caching with live map. Zooming out to 1km and driving loaded several aproximated (orange circled) caches. Zooming to 800m I wanted to get updated coords by opening popup and going back to map. The cache display didn't seem to change on live map. But I got a second cache overlay (without orange circle) below the first almost invisible. I bet, both caches are in the list. NB 2013-03-12

			<description>
		Caches on lists should be initially sorted by distance. After opening the lists or changing between lists I can see, that caches are not sorted by distance initially but seem random. Waiting for some seconds the order suddenly changes to the correct distance sorting. The appearance of this problem seems to be depending on the GPS status for me. If I only work on &quot;coarse location&quot;(i.e. no GPS fix, but position by WLAN/Network) the delay is as described. If GPS signal is fixed the list opens in random order as well but immediately gets resorted. The distances shown in the list are correct at any time, so there seems to be another glitch causing this.

			<description>
		I described something like this already in #2178 but right now I am quite sure what has happened. Today I had the following experience: Started c:geo, waited for Login OK Opened live map and went for a cache Logged the cache from live map popup and returned to live map Then I decided I need a warm up before going for the next cache, thus I &quot;closed&quot; c:geo with the home button on my device Approx 30-50 minutes later I &quot;restarted&quot; c:geo via the normal launcher icon on my home screen It came up immediately with the live map (where I left it) After I moved a bit a reload was triggered and suddenly all my found caches are showing up without found marker (I hide them by default). So it seems the login has expired but c:geo still loads data from the live map as &quot;anonymous&quot; user. We should be able to catch the fact, that the live map is not longer working in &quot;logged in&quot; mode before loading anything from it. Side effect of this: The caches loaded accidently remain in cachecache and thus bother the user until next &quot;cold start&quot; of c:geo.

		There is not enough network input sanitisation. I can look on this, but not now. The problem is, that sometimes you can be connected to wifi network which redirects all http traffic to some page, where you have to insert password. If you are connected to such wifi ... and try to log a cache ... cgeo crashes, instead refusing to log online. (I have suspection that it is something related to trackables, because it works for short period of time (you can type one word or so)).

		With the current RC-version I hav a strange problem today: Perform nearby search 20 results are returned Open several caches from this result (and also store some of them) After return to the cache result the next 20 results see to be loaded each time So after some browsing in the results I finally wondered that the result has grown to 140 caches without selecting to load more results It is not clearly reproducible for me, but has something to do with leaving and reentering the result list. Is this related to #2607 and therefore possibly alreaddy fixed ?

		Reproducible for me only on Android 2.x: I checked the light scheme throughout the app with 2013.03.31-RC2 on a Sasmsung Galaxy Ace GT-I8160 (Android 2.3.6). With my Galaxy S2 (Android 4.1.2) the scheme is correct. When viewing the pictures of a single log entry (not the picture tab of the cache details - this is working fine), the background is still black only the picture caption is shown black on white. As the menu is still usable I set this issue to prriotiy &quot;low&quot;.

		I know a user of c:geo who has visited GC40 and shot a screenshot. She was confused, as the north coordinate showed N 49° 60,000 instead of N 50 00,000. See screenshot. She showed me other screenshots where the east coordinate was wrong the same way. I assume the true coordinate before calculation for display was a very little bit less than N 50 00,000.

		Today I talked to a friend who tried 2 times uploading a log (including an image) and got an error message both times. Afterwards, his log entry was there 2 times in the cache log, but without images. So probably we show an error &quot;Log upload failed&quot;, although in reality only the image upload of the log failed.

			<description>
		I just tried the patch from issue #2640 in the current nightly: I would appreciate having a possibility to filter out stored caches e.g. in search results. It works great. However sometimes the search result does not show full details below the cachename. (&quot;GC... -&quot; instead of &quot;GC... - D 1.5 - T 1.5 - Regular - Offline&quot;) In this case the filter has no effects. If I manually open and close an offline cache the details appear. Is this an intended behavior? Is there a workaround for this?

		Using todays nightly 2013.04.28 I opened the TB33C8K. The newest log contains two photos. If you now scroll down to some older logs you will see, that an older log seems to contain the same photos (same description) which is not the case. Furthermore if you continue to scroll up and down through the logs the link to the attached photos in the newest log is increased by an additional link each time it comes into view. (sorry, hard to describe). So finally if you continuosly scroll up and down you get more and more of the same photo link on the log entries.

		When the nightly is invoked from a mail to open that cache in c:geo, it does only show &quot;Cache&quot; as title below the c:geo icon (instead of &quot;Import into c:geo&quot; or something like that, as before). This is due to my refactoring to let every activity have its title declared in the manifest instead of in the Java code of the activity. To cleanly fix this new problem, I suggest to introduce a new activity for opening a cache from a hyperlink. That new activity would then only handle the intent, and afterwards forward to the cache details activity.

		Some users made me aware, that on devices without magnetic compass sensor our compass wont point to the direction of the cache while walking but does while driving/biking. My assumption is, that we try to get the direction from that not existing sensor (in case the speed is below the coded limit). Is there a possibility to always use GPS for those devices without having the user to select it ?

		Until now I had c:geo 2013.04.05 on my Asus Transformer TF201 tablet.Now c:geo informed me that there is an update (2013.05.16). How ever when I go into the Android Store, it tells me that it is not compatible with my tablet.

		If you leave a personal note, Cgeo seems to save it at first, but if you press refresh or change its status for example after you have found it and log it. It then disappears and you may lose vital information whilst in the field caching! It only remains in place if you have previously entered it from the Geocaching.com website.

		Using NB 2013.05.20: After scrolling several times up and down through the listing of GC4BRWM suddenly the logbook entries were no longer matching the username next to it. This means e.g. that the username &quot;ApproV&quot; who initially published the cache was suddenly shown as the user who wrote the FTF-log. It seems something gets misaligned after scrolling so that username and their corresponding log entries get out of sequence.

		I can no longer use c:geo for geocaching, because c.geo tells me it's unable to log in. I cannot understand it. I can search and watch geocaches, and I can save them to my phone, but I can not navigate to them because c:geo can not log in. I can not use offline maps either. I can use Groundspeak's geocahing.com app, but not c:geo. I am frustrated. I really loved c:geo.

			<description>
		When you click on a cache or trackable in your browser then c:geo is registed as a potential application to handle the url. In a recent change 74fce89 (AndroidManifest.xml) the name of the different activities were changed. Previously the name was always &quot;c:geo&quot;. Now it is &quot;Cache&quot; or &quot;Trackable&quot; depending on the type of url. I think the real application name should be displayed in this dialog. It is currently very annoying that c:geo appear as 1st item (Cache) and 2nd item (Trackable) since the ordering is alphabetical and &quot;Chrome&quot; is the other item in the list.

		We retrieved some mails that logging is not OK with the release version. It could be a result of the site update from yesterday. I just tested it myself with version 2013.05.22 and can reproduce that. c:geo says &quot;Log sucesful&quot; but updating the cache details afterwards the log is not shown. Also on the webpage there is no new log. Feel free to test with GC352Y3 Log will follow.

			<description>
		For testing I also changed to german and tested the switch to english. c:geo switched to english sucessful but I did not see this in the debug logs. It reported 23:20:26.781 Info cgeo 9078  Geocaching.com language already set to English
 but it seemed to have performed the switch. Can someone check the logging for that case ? That could be helpful some time.

			<description>
		During my tests due to the log date problem I have seen that I got logged out while the app was still open but idle. Long time I experienced nothing like this. I opened the log page for a cache I got the error message that c:geo can not load the log page In the log I see a 500 error while loading the log page Trying at the PC I can enforce the 500 by logging out from the page and then trying to load the logpage. So it seems my login expired/invalidated for some reason. I assume this is a fault at the website but we should keep an eye on that. Currently this error is not handled. We could e.g. trigger a relogin in case a 500 error is received.

		c:geo version 2013.05.31a I copied *.zip files to my phone via USB cable. Import folder was chosen. c:geo does not see *zip files. Previously it worked when I changed the extension to gpx even if it was still zip file. a) First of all all found gpx files are shown twice b) importing gpx does not work: 'Cannot parse .gpx file as GPX 1.1: could no parse XML' On the other hand, imports works when I send email myself with changed extension to GPX (gmail does not like *.zip), click 'Download', next c:geo as a program to use with this action. In a new version it could be nice if at least offline logs will be possible for opencaching.pl OC caches which work currently with c:geo. Thanks for correcting it!

		Hello first, sorry for my bad english and sorry too if my post is not an issue and if it's not in the good section. I don't know if i can write it here. I have a problem with distances with a smartphone zopo with android : all caches have several distances for the same point. I saw this in the FAQ : The distance to a cache is fluctuating heavily For some users the distance to a cache in a list of caches or in the compass is jumping between some meters to some kilometers. You are probably running Cyanogenmod ROM. This is a known bug in Cyanogenmod 10. More information can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=6883 So you either have to wait for a fix for this ROM or change to another ROM. The link doesn't work. i'm not using a cyanogen ROM. Do you now if there is an issue for this problem ? Thanks for your answer

		When I go geocaching I just save an offline log on the field and then logs online back at home using my computer. The found caches is now listed in the History List så I know in wich order they were found. But as soon as I view the cache page for a cache found for a time ago it is also added to the list. This messes up the current &quot;found but not logged&quot; count and I have missed a planned milestone cache because of this bahavior. I have two possible change suggestions: Only include caches in the list that was found since the History was cleared last time Add a section for each found date in the list. With a counter for each section. ie: Today [2] Cache name no 1 Cache name no 2 2012-01-03 [1] Cache name no 3

		Activate compass &quot;Start speech&quot; As long as the output is running I can change the volume of the output In the pauses between the output the volume change buttons on my device only change the ringtone volume I was not sure, whether this is a technical limitation, therefore I crosschecked with the original GCBabble and there it is possible to change the output volume also during speech pauses. I think this should also be possible within c:geo. Typically when using loudspeaker you may want to reduce the volume before the next output starts (e.g. in case you walk into a crowd of people) but you actually can not do that but just reduce your ringtone volume instead.

			<description>
		For all settings which require the specification of file paths (e.g. offline map path, GPX import/export path, etc.) it seems there is no longer the possibility to manually enter a path. Bug reports from users have shown in the past that (on some strange devices at least) it can be necessary to do so, because either the dirscanner (offline maps) or the dirchooser (export/import) does not scan/show all existing file structures.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		I first noticed that while caching on the event in Koblenz together with the c:geo team. Today I did some more fieldtesting with the TTS function: As long as I use &quot;GPS + Compass&quot; mode the TTS output for the direction is always accurate (i.e. same as shown on the compass rose). If I use &quot;GPS only&quot; (which is meaningful for using it in some pocket and listen only) the direction shown and TTS output of it is different from each other most of the time. I did not manage to find any logic in it beside one thing: If I am not moving and switch to &quot;GPS only&quot; (this will not get any meaningful direction shown as movement is necessary to calculate the GPS direction towards the cache) the direction shown and TTS output of it are identical. If I now start moving the displayed direction changes immediately but the spoken direction seems to remain as it was or only catch up after a long time. I set this to &quot;medium&quot; as using &quot;GPS only&quot; mode is pretty helpful in combination with TTS output.

		When you choose to sort the caches by name, it doesn't work properly. This bug seems to arrive when there are numbers in the geocache name and a number is re-used later in the name. For example, with the following names : GR8 01-01, GR8 01-02, GR8 01-03, GR8 01-04, GR8 01-05, GR8 01-06, GR8 01-07, GR8 01-08, GR8 01-09, the result will be : GR8 01-08, GR8 01-01, GR8 01-02, GR8 01-03, GR8 01-04, GR8 01-05, GR8 01-06, GR8 01-07, GR8 01-09. The example is real. It occure on a French Southwest serial of geocaches. And there are others same cases. It's not an heavy problem but thank you if you coulde resolve it. Sorry for my english. I send you a sunny memory (36 ºC) of France. Chrono81. PS : I'm waiting to be able to read the whole information of date (and not 26.07.20..) beside the logs.

		I've just seen this on the release version: A non archived cache has been stored locally (and it has an offline log). By now the cache is archived on the website. You can refresh the cache in the app as often as you want, it doesn't get show the archived state anywhere. I cannot reproduce this currently on my own device, because for me the same cache is archived when I download it the first time. Will have to debug into that faking the non archived state first.

		I opened the live map today with 2013.08.03-NB and while loading I noticed the following: In the first phase the map was populated from PNG parsing and caches appeared with orange circle After that a nearby search was triggered and the orange circles disappeared for those 20 caches So far, so good but: I can verify that caches parsed with an incorrect type are not corrected (see screenshot where an Earth cache is shown, but it is an Webcam cache) I am quite sure, that I have seen that none of the icon position moved on the map. This would mean that the precise coords from the nearby search do not replace the approximated coords from the parsing. But I am not sure of this issue right now.

		Hi... Since a few days I have the following problem: Live map = OSM. Choose a cache from map, start navigation (from cache preview or detailed view) --&gt; black screen for 2.. 3.. seconds, then cgeo jumps back to live map. Live map = Google Navigation starts correct. Now I can change the map to OSM, everything works fine. When I go back to the live map, Google is still displayed. Choose another cache, start navigation, cgeo uses OSM. Go back to live map --&gt; still Google. Change live map now to OSM --&gt; same problem like in case 1. Tried: New Installation of cgeo from app store and the current Nightly Builds Version: 2013.08.04-NB-62677dd. Downloaded new OSM maps here: http://download.mapsforge.org/maps/europe/germany/ Using Android V 4.1.2 Help :)

		I would like to take the posting from @BudBundi to the issuetracker to start a discussion: TB Page not correct load with vodafone DE Beitragvon BudBundi » 06 Aug 2013, 23:05 I have told that to some of you on the MEGA Eck when load a TB Page over the Vodafone DE Network it isn't showing correct. So I investigate in that a little and found that the vodafone proxy try to optimize the HTML and delete some empty divs and not used styles. You can change that when load http://perfomance.vodafone.de and change the settings to optimize off or in expert settings optimize html off. Perhaps that is something for the FAQ. Adding this to the FAQ is one point, but another point would be to compare the HTML-output with both settings and see whether we can optimize our parsing so that this optimization does not have any impact to it. As far as I know these performance proxy installation they usually only strip &quot;unnecessary&quot; HTML-content (like comments, unsued scripts, etc.) from pages and additionally compress pictures requested in that HTML before transfering it to the user. So it is somehow strange that these break our parsing. I also met a user recently with the same problem on Telekom-D1 network in Germany. So it is not specific to one operator but may spread widely with all operators using that kind of proxy. Here are the infos provided by the german network operators: D1: http://www.t-mobile.de/speedmanager/0,20641,24079-_,00.html VF:http://www.vodafone.de/business/hilfe-support/vodafone-performance-manager.html E+: Proxy introduction was stopped (AFAIK) 02: Proxy program was live but terminated after a few months (AFAIK)

		(sorry if this should be a douplicated issue, i dont found an other one with my seach before) Sometimes I have to switch from c:geo to an other app and back. For example for calculating new coordinates or making a photo. When c:geo is not active the gps gets deactivated. (Sometimes I even go to the home screen to disable gps and save energy.) After switching back to cgeo the gps needs one second to get a fix again. When I use the live-map I get a trail from N0°E0° near africa to my current position in that moment. When I switch between apps a few times (for example to calculate the next part of coordinates) there comes more and more of this trail-lines from 0° to different positions around me. At least it gets sometimes almoust impossible to see the southern part of the map. Possible solution could be to filter the 0°position from using for the trail or to filter very large jumps of the trail in little time.

In the log I can see that the data is being imported but at the same time the static map download is triggered for each cache. After importing is done (acc. to log) the progress for static map download is shown normally and it seems the maps are downloaded once again. So the fault is: Static maps should not be downloaded during the file import but seperately Progress indicator is wrong

			<description>
		WIth 2013.08.21-NB I experienced this. It is hard to describe, therefore I attached screenshots (First is the map with caches as it was presented, second is the list of the caches (Menu -&gt; Show as list)). It is also difficult to describe how that happend. I have been in the very same map area yesterday with the live map active. So most probably the caches have already been cached. Today I returned there and opened the live map again....this is what I got. The map is in strategy detailed. Due to the fact, that there are unknown cache types without orange circle my assumption is that merging of nearby result with map data is confused somehow.

		Caches which ones got an offline-log that were cleared afterwards remain in the history. In my eyes that is not helpful but a bit irritating. The caches will (correctly) not exported in field-notes but of course counted in the sum of history records. You get a wrong number of caches when you like to know the sum of founds since your last history export/reset. Im am not shure if its related with related to #3081 or a complety different issue.

		From support mail: I am running c:geo version 2013.08.24 and have Light Skin selected. When I go into Settings, the main screen is displayed correctly. When I select any sub-option, the text is not visible. I have to slide finger up or down (scroll) and then text will appear. Running on HTC Incredible Phone. For me on Android 4.x it is working normal. But HTC Incredible for sure has some Android 2.x version which I am unable to test. Maybe someone can have a look on the emulator. AFAIR we already had some version specific problems with the light skin in the past.

			<description>
		In the newest nightly-builds I noticed that the same cache-popup on the livemap sometimes opens a few times. Sometimes it needs a second or two until that popup is open. When I touch on the cache icon again and again in that time (because I don't know if the device had realised my touch) the popup opens again after I touched the dark map to to close it. So in some cases I have to touch the map three or four times to go back to the map.

			<description>
		Sometimes not all stored caches will be shown on the map. I noticed this much times when I zoom out from a center of an imported PQ with 500 or more caches. The round circle full of caches seem to be cutted at the half and the eastern part is missing. If the shape of imported PQ is round that is easy to recognize but if it is rectangular (for example from gsak) that can be really irritating. If its really not possible to display all caches I whould like to get a short error-message.

		If a trackable is in the hands of a cacher then the TB page says &quot;In the hands of XXX&quot;. This text is clickable and should open a menu where &quot;XXX&quot; is used as data. Right now the data is &quot;In the hands of XXX&quot; that will lead to opening invalid links in browser or trying to view invalid data. The problem is that UserActionsClickListener.java is using the full text of the view as data...

		From support mail (did not have time to verify this yet): I think there is some problem with cache attributes (considering opencaching.pl). Before August update I could see the attributes (not sure if all) in text form just below cache description. Now, in new version only few attributes are displayed as icons (changing into text after touching) below cache main details screen. Most of attributes are skipped. Why?

		I just tested the circles feature. To be of any value to owners it should draw circles only around physical stages of a cache. That is a) the coordinates of a traditional cache b) the physical stages of a multi-cache (where a box is hidden to give further clues) c) the final coordinates of a multi-cache (if available) d) the final coordinates of a mystery (if available) I checked the current stable version (2013.08.26) and also the nightly build (2013.09.06-NB-e21a54e) and in both circles are drawn around multi-cache header coordinates and mysteries. That is a bug and should be corrected.

		When I open a cache-detail-page on my devices (latest stable or nightly builds) and than &gt;menu&gt;navigate&gt;map I get the map with this one cache and its waypoints only.

		Filtering for Whereigo or Letterbox (did not try all the other „exotic“ cache types) shows me all OC caches mixed with the correctly filtered GC caches in &quot;nearby&quot; search. As OC does not support these cache types, i propose the OC caches should default to NOT match these filters. Now they seem to default to match the filter &quot;just in case&quot;, or erronously.

So now the user has two finds and c:geo shows them normally. Prior to that the user tried resinstalling,etc,etc. with the same result that 0 caches are shown. So I guess there is really a problem recognizing a find count of 1.

			<description>
		When events are created in the users calendar using the calendar addon, then the coordinates are added as well. These coords has used to open Google Maps or other apps like OsmAnd to view the position. Now it seem like the intent format has changed since Maps don't find anything and OsmAnd indicates that part of the coords are lost.

		I can currently not provide a step-by-step for this but its quite obvious: 2013.09.20-NB Filter for a special cache type (global filter) Open live map Zoom or pan around (I guess zooming out below where gc.com hides them for PM) Some caches of other types (parsed from map, orange circled) appear and stay (also when zooming in again) Solution would be limiting the minimum zoom-level in which tiles are requested (as discussed in another issue) or refiltering after parsing (I guess this is currently only done for BM).

			<description>
		Our OAuth signing is wrong for the reserved characters of RFC 3986. OAuth requires everything except unreserved characters to be encoded: http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#encoding_parameters I found this while trying to add support for name search in OKAPI and failed for a long time, due to us not encoding the asterisk wildcard &quot;*&quot;. Even if our OAuth signing method is only 20 lines, to me this issue (and the hours I spent looking back and forth) makes me think it should be replaced by a ready-made library.

			<description>
		I just made a longer multi cache and used the note taking field below the listing to keep track of the variables i took along the route. It read like A=1
B=2
C=3
 Suddenly when looking again at the list later, it read A=1
B=2
C=3
--
A=1
B=2
C=3
 The content has been doubled, separated by &quot;--&quot;. I could continue editing the (doubled) content without problems, and nothing strange happened any more. I am very, very sure i did not copy the content or type the &quot;--&quot; by myself. Is this a bug or some obscure type of feature i accidently triggered? I cannot reproduce the cause, but perhaps someone can have a look if something inside the note taking field looks fishy or if there is some reference to the string &quot;--&quot; somewhere.

		With NB 2013.10.03 I experienced several crashes in different parts of the app which didnot stop until I deactivated oc.de. NB 2013.10.02 was quite stable. So my assumption (which is totally unvalidated due to lack of logging capability) would be that something with the oc.de interface is broken from yesterday to today. A focus area of the crashes are in the search field when searching for cache name or GC-code. Reproducible for me was: Search for &quot;GC4&quot; Progress window is shown but before cache is displayed c:geo crashes Note: OC.de was activated in parallel to gc.com to that time I am outside the OC.de area (&gt;200km rule applies) Edit: changed title according to description from @AlfredSK

		Today I noticed that the userdefined description text which is shown for each waypoint in the WP tab gets mixed up when scrolling through the list of waypoints. I can not exactly give a clue on when this happens, but if a cache has e.g. 12 waypoints where the first one has the description &quot;This is a small parking spot&quot; and you scroll down and up the list a few times suddenly some of the other waypoints also show the description &quot;This is a small parking spot&quot; in the overview. Such a like this happens with all WP texts randomly. If you open those wrong described waypoints the wrong description is not shown, which probably means it is only a problem in the WP overview view. 2013.11.09-NB

		I assume by the recent changes in the connector framework, the currently gc.com-specific 'more'-search was broken. Even though it is a regression, IMO it is not very critical. Instead of re-activating this short-term, we should rather try to generalize it (as it is available for OKAPI as well) mid-term.

			<description>
		This is no bug in c:geo but I want to document this here as a reminder: The GPX file returned from ec.com seems not to include the information that the user already found the cache. This leads to the problem that already found caches are not shown as found. I contacted their support to ask whether this is intentional or not. Update: For the map API it is working.

		It looks like DataStore.loadWaypoints() sometimes manage to initialize the lazy list with null. This, in turn, should only happen when geocode is blank. I think that in this case an empty collection should be returned instead of an empty list after writing an error message in the log. Another reason to not accept null as a completion value for a lazy list is that null represents a non-yet-completed lazy list, and subsequent calls to getList() will try to complete the list again. java.lang.NullPointerException

			<summary>Clear up GPS status in cache list activity</summary>

			<bugID>Issue #3522</bugID>
			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		As in several other activities, the GPS is turned on when entering a cache list in onResume() and turned off (if noone else requires it) in onPause(). In parallel, we try to be clever by turning it off while refreshing caches, and turning if back on when the refresh is finished (regularly or through a user cancel). This two cycles do not cope well with each other. It led to #3521 where the GPS will stay turned on after we navigate away from the activity or from cgeo entirely. The fix is only partial, and will lead to the GPS not being turned on spontaneously when a list refresh is cancelled (but will resume regular behaviour when navigating away from the activity by going back in cgeo or by displaying the details of a cache). I think we try to be too clever here. The questions we should ask ourselves are: Do we need the GPS to be turned on while displaying a cache list? Do we need the GPS to be turned off while refreshing the caches? Note that keeping the GPS turned on may be overriden by an explicit user action (the user is always free to disable the GPS and this is easy to do from the status bar on most devices), and preserve an up-to-date distance and direction (if the GPS is used for it) for the caches displayed in the background window. What do you think we should be doing? Should we keep being clever or should we adopt more simple an approach?

		While attaching pictures on my mobile (Samsung Galaxy S3) to a cache, I notice that the pictures get rotated. I've tried taking landscape and portrait and each time they are rotated. This happens when taking &quot;New&quot; pictures. Could the problem be fixed, or provide a way for the picture to be rotated in the app? Very happy to provide any extra information.

		A handful of users on support mail and FB are reporting that they experience force closes regularly when trying to open saved caches. It helped to reset c:geo to factory defaults in all cases, however one user investigated a bit more and reported this: If the option &quot;Last Details page&quot; is active, those crashes are happening. Switching that option off everything is OK. I can not reproduce this using the current market version, but the explanation is somehow trustworthy. Any idea ?

		2014.01.17-NB This issue happens also in other scenarios but this one is reproducible for me : Open a list Select Manage -&gt; Import from internet &quot;Waiting for caches&quot; dialog shown Cancel Select again Manage -&gt; Import from internet Nothing happens I have the feeling this also happens on the first try if other operations to that list (e.g. delete, move, refresh) have been done before. Leaving and reentering the list makes it work again (for one time).

		If I open a new log window on an oc cache, that requires a log password and it opens as 'note' (because I already found the cache), the box for entering the log password isn't made visible when I change the log type to found. Consequently sending the log will fail. If I close and re-open the (stored) log, the password box is visible correctly.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		From the German geocaching forum (translation by me): My current observation is, that after the phone has been in sleep-mode for a longer time, c:geo is not able to re-activate the GPS. Neither the new location symbol from Android nor the GPS symbol is shown. After stopping and re-starting c;geo it works again. (Android 4.4, cyanogenmod 11, HTC one, c:geo NB from 27.01.2014 probably) (Original text from http://forum.geoclub.de/viewtopic.php?p=1154170#p1154170): Allerdings, nach meiner bisherigen Beobachtung, wenn das Handy offensichtlich längere Zeit im Sleepmodus war, kriegt c:geo GPS nicht wieder aktiviert. Weder das neue Lokalisationssymbol von Android noch das GPS-Symbols eines GPS-Tools erscheint dann wieder in der Statusleiste. Der Workaround geht folgendermaßen: c:geo abschießen und neu starten, danach funktioniert GPS auch wieder.

		2014.02.05-NB If I start navigation from a cache using Radar (with GPSStatus) the target coords are not the desired coords but some which have nothing to do with that cache. I did not get my PC running with logcat yet, but I would guess the radar uses the last target coords it has and we for some reason stopped handing over coords when calling the Radar. Please try to reproduce, maybe there is a problem with my installation.

		I am using Version 2014.02.04 in the moment. When I open a list I can use the &quot;filter&quot;-menu to show only special kinds of caches like &quot;with changed coordinates&quot;. I like to use the &quot;show on map&quot;-menu for that results. I have the app locus installed so after use this menu entry I get asked wich map I like to use. When I chose to watch the caches in locus everything is OK. But when I use the cgeo-map for it I get not only the filter-result-caches but all chaches on the list.

		We support showing unpublished caches for the owner. That works normal in 2014.03.01-NB. However the special log types are not recognized.

			<description>
		A user reported that setting the type filter to &quot;Wherigo&quot; shows many different caches on the live map which shouldn't be there. I tested it and made the following observations: Prerequisites: Enable global cache type filter &quot;Wherigo&quot; Choose live map strategy &quot;fast&quot; Do not have any caches in the database for the testing region (e.g. clear data before) Premium member? Observations: All caches are ?? although I zoomed in to &quot;200 m&quot; These ?? include: traditional, multi, unknown, etc. (all cache types?) But not all caches are shown, only a small subset (but with many types) Leave the live map and return to it (maybe unnecessary) Some Wherigo symbols appear. Open one of them and it will change its type to &quot;Earthcache&quot; (also other types?) If you need an area to test it, try Hanover in Germany.

			<description>
		Using 2014.03.19-NB (but probably existing much longer) It happens sporadically when scrolling or zooming the map that waypoints are still shown although the defined limit of caches shown is reached. I have set the &quot;hide waypoint on map&quot; limit to 10. I scrolled to an area on the map with well over 10 caches but still the waypoints are shown. Only after another manual operation (e.g. zoom out and zoom in again or scroll in one direction and back to the orginal position) the waypoints are correctly hidden. I can give no clear instruction of when this error shows up but my feeling is, that it happens after several zoom and scroll operations. To make this more clear, here are some screenshots: Map drawing not correct (limit 10, 15 caches shown) After moving the map just a little bit forth and back it updates and hides the waypoints as it should:

		Today I was on tour. First I logged a cache. But no smiley appeared on map. I didn't think more about because sometimes it changes on move. Another cache I needed to update. It was archived and the cache icon shows grey but it didn't disappear because it was stored? However, so I removed the cache and the disc image disappeared but the grey archived cache resided. Another cache updated and removed but icon with disc resided. Another cache I removed without update because now I knew the whole series was archived. The icon didn't change a bit. I killed cgeo between but the icons stay on map although they are removed. Strange behaviour. NB 2014-03-27 I know caching last sunday the icon changed to smiley and disappeared from map.

			<description>
		The cache GC245X3 has 243 images (which is quite unusual but good for testing purposes). When opening the image tab I can see that a certain amount of pictures but not all are loaded. Depending on the used device the amount of pictures loaded differs, but some keep missing. With the debug log it is hard to distinguish whether all of them are requested and some not returned or we just stop requesting. That would need further analysis. Anyway it ends up with having &quot;spinning circles&quot; as placeholder for some of the pictures but no more network traffic ongoing.

			<description>
		Hi, since the last update, the compass has a deviation of -90° when holding the device in landscape mode. I'm running Android 4.2.2 with a Kernel 3.4.5 on a ASUS ME173X (Built ME173X_WW_user_4.2.4.72702_20131128) If I have another app using the compass, like GPS Status, it works well when turning the device. Rebooting and locking the screen in landscape mode doesn't have any effect.

		2014.04.05-NB (but probably exisiting since the recent changes to the long click events): It happens to me quite often, that when trying a long click on a cache in a list the context menu opens but shortly after that the cache details are opened and the context menu vanishes. It is quite easy to reproduce: When you do a really long click the context menu opens as expected When you do a really short click the details are opened as expected If you do a click which is just at the time limit of a long click the described problem shows up

		2014.04.20-NB (but most probably not new in this version): For my holiday I stored a list with an imported PQ of 1000 caches. This slows down a c:geo a lot: Scrolling through the lists is stuttering not always but most of the time Opening a single cache from the ist and returning from the cache to the list takes considerable time (1-2 seconds) The situation gets worse in the following scenario: Open cache list with 1000 caches Apply a filter (e.g. Attribut -&gt; Medium hike) Open details of a cache from the filtered list Return to the list In this scenario two things are noticeable: Even the attribut selection list in the filter menu is stuttering when scrolling It takes 7-10 seconds until the list is shown after the last step Setting label &quot;Unverified&quot; as I have no possibility to take a log currently. Mabye someone can try to reproduce with a 1000-PQ. This is one of my usual holiday usecases and I never experienced such problems before (last time used in February). It is not related to the mini-compass (tested by disabling it in settings).

			<description>
		Seen with 2014.04.21-NB and also read about it on IRC: Sometimes when using the filters it seems to be possible to apply a combination of filters (i.e. after selecting one filter, select another one and both are applied). While this can make sense for some usecases, there seem to be problems with that: Only the latest selected filter is shown in the headline of the list Sometimes applying a new filter seems to cancel the filter applied before (not sure under which conditions) but not always. Sometimes selecting &quot;Reset filter&quot; does not really cancel them, but still only a subset of the caches on the list is shown but there is no UI indication anymore, that there is still something filtered out Will check if I find a reproducible case for this one.

		Over the last weeks we received around 30 mails with same symptoms: Login fails (acc. to main screen) Same on wifi and mobile network &quot;Identify as Android browser&quot; does not help &quot;Check login&quot; reports Unknown communication error Reenter and check credentials done without success For all(!) of these users the problem was solved by one of the following: Reinstall c:geo Delete all data in Android settings Any idea, what went wrong here? Any idea, how to get more clues on this (besides having a log)?

		I did a nearby search with only OC.DE being active. All caches are fine, except for OCF1F1. It is shown as unknown, but the description looks like an event. My app version is a self made one which is some weeks old. So if no one can reproduce, I will look at that with current code after my holiday.

		While on the live map and pulling up map settings, toggling &quot;Show own/found caches&quot; will only turn off your finds on the map, not your hides. As evidenced by my GitHub username, I am the OpenCaching.us webmaster, and may be able to answer technical questions about our site. I am only a server admin though, most definitely not a coder. :-)

		Open a cache list. All menu items are available. Switch directly to the history list. The &quot;list&quot; menu item is now invisible, correctly. Switch directly to a real cache list. The &quot;list&quot; item remains invisible, wrongly. It only works correctly again when exiting the list activity to the main screen and then reopening the lists.

		It seems to me that the GPX files exported from c:geo are no longer readable by Garmin. I'm using the export function to generate GPX files that I then upload to my Garmin device (Garmin Oregon 450t). This worked like a charm for years already. With the last c:geo update (version 2014.04.30) I happily noticed that the process of exporting GPX files significantly sped up. However, the resulting files are no longer accepted by my Garmin device. I tested this with an older GPX file that I generated with c:geo as well and that file worked just fine again.

		2014.05.07-NB Received a GPX file (exported from cgeo) via mail Opened the file in my mail program Selected c:geo as target app c:geo opens and asks for a list to store the caches After selecting the list nothing happens (only the list is shown) Manually importing the file (via Manage -&gt; Import GPX) works without a problem. I am not sure whether this used to work before with my mail client, therefore setting &quot;Unverified&quot;. But IMO it should work if c:geo can be selected when opening the file, or not?

With the current 2014.05.11-NB I can still see, that this procedure is not working. MapFactor Navigator is started but remains on the startup screen. Hint: If I use this procedure I can start navigation with MapFactor Navigator: Open cache details Menu -&gt; Navigate -&gt; &quot;Google Maps Route&quot; Select the app: &quot;MapFactor Navigator&quot; @Bananeweizen : Disregard my email concerning Sygic navigation.

		2014.05.12-NB: For testing another issue I imported 4000 caches to a list. This slows down the UI significantly: When leaving the cache details back to that list, it takes around 3-5 seconds to open the list. App not responsive during that time. Applying a filter takes up to 10 seconds. App not responsive during that time. Deleting a subset of the caches on the list (e.g. preselected by applying a filter) most often leads to an ANR-error.

Go to menu, sorting I see sort order &quot;log date&quot; I select sort order &quot;distance&quot; Order does not change Checking menu, &quot;sorting&quot; again, it still shows &quot;log date&quot; Same happens when jumping to &quot;Verlauf&quot; directly from main screen, and selecting any other list there. It seems as if selecting list &quot;Verlauf&quot; locks sort order to log date. It gets unlocked when going back to main screen and selecting &quot;saved caches&quot; again. Then ordering is by distance, until i select &quot;Verlauf&quot; again. Expected behaviour: Restore previous sort order when going from &quot;Verlauf&quot; to any other list.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		Today a user told me that c:geo shows &quot;0 m/h&quot; as the speed. That's not miles per hour, but meters per hour. getSpeed() calls getDistanceFromKilometers() which calls scaleDistance():             if (distanceKilometers &gt;= 1) {
                distance = distanceKilometers;
                units = &quot;km&quot;;
            } else {
                distance = distanceKilometers * 1000;
                units = &quot;m&quot;;
            } That means that the string will contain m/h as long as the speed is below 1 km/h. It looks like this behavior is intended.             TestSettings.setUseImperialUnits(false);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 km/h&quot;, 122.782f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 km/h&quot;, 123.456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;12.3 km/h&quot;, 12.3456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;1.23 km/h&quot;, 1.23456f);
            assertSpeed(&quot;123 m/h&quot;, 0.123456f);
            TestSettings.setUseImperialUnits(true);
            assertSpeed(&quot;76.7 mph&quot;, 123.456f);

 I wonder if this high precision is really necessary. Before committing my changes I want to get feedback for the following results:             TestSettings.setUseImperialUnits(false);

		With the new UI, the title of a cache list is only updated after loading the complete list. Until then it is basically empty. This makes the spinner &quot;triangle&quot; in the actionbar jump around every time you open a cache list. While we don't know the number of caches in advance, we should at least set the title of the list before we actually load its caches, to avoid that &quot;jumping&quot;.

		2014.05.26-NB: Open list of saved caches Filter in a way that only a subset of the list is returned (e.g. Size - Regular) Result: Not that the count in the header still shows `xx Caches`` where xx represents the total and not the filtered amount In nearby search however it works liek before: Perform nearby search Filter in a way that only a subset of the list is returned (e.g. Size - Regular) Result (as expected): The heading shows yy caches/xx caches where yy is the filtered amount and xx is the total amount (like it was before implementing the actionbar)

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		To me the progress of refreshing caches looks quite confusing (just testing in the wild). It always jumps from 0 to 2, and it reaches 100% some time before the dialog closes (probably when it starts downloading the last cache). Looks like an off by one error somehow. Is that just my imagination? For reproduction, take GC caches only, as all other sources are to fast.

			<description>
		We had several user reports issues with hangs/ANRs after unlocking a phone that has been locked on the map screen for an extended period (10 mins till over 1 hour). Digging into this I was able to see, that the unsubscribe in CGeoMap.onPause does not stop the LoadTimerAction from being called. According to my limited knowledge this is what unsubscribe is for. I was unable to finally deduce if this is an implementation Problem (incorrect Api usage) or a bug in rxJava. If the latter is true, it seems to be present even in the latest 0.19.0 version (I could not fully switch to that, but had to fake/comment out stuff related to the GeoDir handler in order to build it) Any of the more experienced (@samueltardieu @Bananeweizen ) that can shed some light on this or provide pointers for further research?

		According to our FAQ and my experience we support all of the date formats of gc.com except dd/MM/yyyy as we can not differentiate it from MM/dd/yyyy So we support and detect: yyyy-MM-dd yyyy/MM/dd MM/dd/yyyy dd/MMM/yyyy MMM/dd/yyyy dd MMM yy See: http://faq.cgeo.org/#1_6 Right now the amount of people having problems with log dates and contacting us has raised. I checked the website and have seen the following new(?) date formats: dd.MMM.yyyy dd.mm.yyyy Seems gc.com introduced '.' as separator as well. At least four users gave feedback, that they were actually using one of these but did not actively change to that. So might be, that they changed some defaults based on whatever rule. Shall we do anything for that? dd.MMM.yyyy should be detectable and usable, but dd.mm.yyyy is not usable I think (due to the existing mm.dd.yyyy)

		2014.06.21-NB: This scenario was working in the past and I used it quite a lot: Open a cache which has saved waypoints Open map for a waypoint Select &quot;Enable live&quot; on the map Expectation: Map is working as live map now (showing saved caches as well as loading live caches) Result: No loading, no caches shown

		From support mail: I'm using export from cgeo and import to Locus. I noticed this issue Mystery vs Unknown C:geo exports mystery caches with Geocache| groundspeak:typeMystery Cache/groundspeak:type Locus expects Geocache|Unknown Cache groundspeak:type/groundspeak:type At http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#mystery I found this information: Note: Cache owners creating a mystery/puzzle cache will select &quot;&quot; from the cache types on the cache submission form http://www.geocaching.com/hide/cachebasics.aspx. I think &quot;Unknown Cache&quot; is the correct cache type.

		With #1399 a similar/the same problem was solved. I just purchased a SGS4 with has a higher resolution as SGS3 and now those overlay icons loog missized again (refer to screenshots in original issue, it looks quite the same). As my SGS3 was OK with the same build I guess we have the same problem now with one higher resolution step. Remark; For the SGS3 it was solved with this commit: a0566f5

			<description>
		Been running the latest nightly builds for som time now and there's one annoying bug with the ones I've used this week. The history doesn't contain all the offline logs resulting in missing found logs when exporting the feild notes. I noticed this the first time July 16th and it's the same today. All caches are saved and updated on the phone prior to caching. The offline logs are saved and I'm able to open the logs from the individual caches, but they simply don't appear in the history. Today 2 of the caches are not shown, last time it was 3 or 4. Currently running 2014-07-18-NB1-0822830 and can confirm that the bug is still there.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		I just had an ANR in CacheListActivity. I opened a pocket query ZIP file from the launcher and selected c:geo. The app opened, but nothing happened afterwards. This is in a location, where I normally only get a GPS fix after quite some time. I run a one or two days old build with enabled Play service location provider. My feeling is this could be a &quot;block until GPS is ready&quot; issue again.

		If no gcvote rating is present, the favorite rectangle on the lists do have a black border (1dp) on the white theme. However if a rating is present (background is green/orange/red) the border is missing. I do not see why this is the case, because the border color is defined. Probably another appearance of the confusing alpha values in the ARGB color definitions. Will try investigate this.

			<description>
		When navigating to one of the additional waypoints of a cache (e.g. stages of a multicache), the cache itself is displayed on the map instead of the selected waypoint. When trying to navigate to that waypoint again, it works. Steps to reproduce: open a cache with multiple waypoints go to the left-most screen (list of waypoints) select a waypoint (e.g. a station of a multi-cache) so that you get the context menu select Navigate select Map Current result: main icon of that cache is displayed (on its correct location) Expected result: selected waypoint should be displayed on the map Workaround: go back to the waypoint list repeat the steps Notes: seems to be timing related on slower devices the problem only happens occasionally

The user should have the choice to partially erase the database (connector dependent) when switching from a valid logged in user into another one on any connector.

			<description>
		I have recently noticed multiple instances of following feature: I'm in GMT +02 timezone (Helsinki). I have this timezone setting both in my phone and in geocaching.com (just checked). If I submit a new log (i.e. Cache found) before 10 am Finnish time, using &quot;Today&quot; as submission date, the log will show with the previous date in geocaching.com. I.e. today 21.8. I submitted online two cache visits between 9 and 10 a.m. from my Android phone using c:geo. When reviewing these logs with my computer, I find out that both instances have been saved in geocaching.com with date 20.8. This has happened before, also i.e. with a morning meet log. It seems that somewhere in the chain the time stamps are not handled correctly. I have also reported this problem to geocaching.com, since I've learned that similar problem occurs also with some other online software, at least neongeo.

		When using the app on Samsung Galaxy Note 2, you open the compass to direct you to the cahe coordinates, it remains static. Distance to coords changes, gps position moves as expected, but compass doesnt move or is jumpy and then freezes. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled to no effect. This was working perfectly up until a day ago.

			<description>
		It looks like Android 3.x does not exhibit any action bar on our map activities. To avoid a crash (see #4240), we allowed users of Android 3.x to launch the map but without any bar nor menu. This makes the map mostly unusable.

			<description>
		Right now, Settings.migrateSettings() is called if the right version is not found. However, in the absence of settings (for example in a fresh installation), this method is called and for integer settings install settings that might be different than the default found in the corresponding setter. This led to #3723 because the default was present in two places. We should avoid callling migrateSettings if no previous settings are present, for example by checking for the presence of a known key which had always been there, or by checking (if possible) for the presence of those shared preferences.

Sometimes the button is shown but when you press it, it changes to the arrow for loading nearby caches.

		This may be related to the map scale issue. My list of caches, sorted by proximity, jumps wildly. I have a cache at 149m, then after a few seconds I see it at 3.26km, then again at 149m... GPS fix is stable, position icon on map is stable. GPS fix on map in other apps is stable. Position in GPS status app is stable. I am connected to internet via wifi, I have GSM off. The same happens with GSM+WiFi all off, or with all on. At first it may seem like jumps between coarse and fine location, but in airplane mode there is no coarse location provider (eg. GSM tower)

		When invoking the translation menu on an encoded hint the result is just garbage. We should make the cache details creator set explicit ids for each line (which must be defined in ids.XML) instead of using id.value everywhere. When we have explicit ids for each line then we can easily take the necessary string from the cache member fields instead of reading it from the text controls.

		Today I was out caching with 2014.10.09-NB and had the following problem, which I try to describe: Low power mode activated in c:geo I started at home where I had Wifi active in my home network I drove 35km to the cache location Activated the live map The initial position before GPS fix is accquired is still &quot;at home&quot; making the position jump 35km forth and back on each standby and resume of the map Most probably the location provider had no better information, so it took the last available approximated position until the fix is done. What I don't understand is, that this happens repeatedly altough after the first fix the location provider should rather assume that I am on the last known position. Is this a problem/behaviour of the Google Service or can we do anything about that. I never experienced this &quot;problem&quot; in c:geo versions without Google Location Service.

		Hi, I have a crash that can be reproduced (at least on my phone). Running 18/9/2014 (latest from playstore) on Galaxy S3 Cyanogenmod 11 M11. I tried https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/wiki/Send-log-to-developers but it doesn't generate any log output. Just some few lines about an activity starting: --------- beginning of /dev/log/main
I/Timeline( 5904): Timeline: Activity_idle id: android.os.BinderProxy@41c450a8 time:375560
W/InputEventReceiver( 5904): Attempted to finish an input event but the input event receiver has already been disposed.
I/Timeline( 5904): Timeline: Activity_idle id: android.os.BinderProxy@41e248b0 time:405629

I/Timeline( 5904): Timeline: Activity_idle id: android.os.BinderProxy@41e248b0 time:739101
 If I go to /dev/log to see what's in the logs, there are only empty files there. The google crash report does show the stacktrace nicely, but it seems impossible to store this report somewhere? To reproduce I do the following: Open a pocket query in c:geo with more than 20 caches in result. First 20 are showing. Apply filter: Status=Not Stored. Observe less than 20 result remaining, for example 19. Select Store Offline from menu. Select create new list. Observe crash after a few seconds. There's an IndexOutOfBoundsException in CacheListActivity.java:286. Please note that when I rerun the scenario above, there are less than 19 caches not stored. For example 16. Next run: 14 not stored, etc. So it does store some caches before crashing. It does not show any progress in the bar before crashing. So maybe it tries to update the progress bar and crashes? If I try the exact same pocket query with no filter, I can store it fine. I tried with different pocket queries, so it looks like it doesn't matter which pocket query I use. Anything else I can provide?

		I have one saved solved mystery (in a list) where i set the calculated final WP coordinate as new cache coordinate, locally and on the web site. When doing a search for nearby caches, i see the cache listed with (and sorted by) the distance to the publish coordinates, not the new saved coordinates. When i go to the cache details, i see the correct (bigger) distance to the final. When returning to the list of nearby caches, now that cache is listed with and sorted by the correct (bigger) distance. This can be reproduced by closing the list of nearby caches and opening it again. I expect to see the distance to the cache to be correct upfront. Version: 2014.10.28-NB-935444e

		While reading #4441 I remembered a similar issue on the live map which I experienced with 2014.10.25-NB: Have some caches with modified coords saved in c:geo Open the live map of this location (it might be important for this issue, that the listing coords and the modified coords are both within the map view) While the live map is loading the solved mytery are already shown at their modified coords (including the flagpost overlay icon) as it should be After loading it might happen (but not always) that the solved mystery jumps to the listing coords (but still showing the flagpost overlay) This situation can be corrected by moving or zooming the map which makes the caches jump back to their modified coords @samueltardieu As you are assigned to #4441 maybe you can take a look at this one as well. I assume the wrong positioning comes from a similar source = The nearby search performed during live map loading

		Today I attended an event, where a user showed me the following crash scenario on his Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (running Android 4.4.2) with c:geo version 2014.09.18: Open live map using OSM:Offline map Rotate 3 times On fourth rotation c:geo crashes The specific play report shows only this: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

 This can not be the multiwindow bug as it should be disabled in that version. I can contact the user. What else would we need to find the reason? Possibly a memory dump...but AFAIR this is not automatically created in the release version isn't it?

		When showing cache details and swiping to the logbook page, some recent logs are shown. The name of the logger, the logtype (e.g. found it, didn't find it) and the number of found caches are shown with the logtext, but I am also interested in the log dates. Was the cache found recently, was the cache found every day or only once a month. When showing the dates this gives you more information about that.

		As the login error message on gc.com changed we currenlty always report &quot;Unknown error&quot;. Seems they now alway report Either your username or password is incorrect. Please try again. If you've forgotten your information, click here.
 So we might now be unable to distinguish between username or password failure and should always probably give the same message as above.

Login is checked OK, all other functions normal. Any idea? I asked him to crosscheck another device and another user on his device. Waiting for answer. To only &quot;unusual&quot; thing I noticed up to now is, that the user has a 5-digit find count. Might this influence the parsing at that point?

With current master I can not reproduce this. I will test the market version later and report back.

		In detail view, date when cache was found is displayed after the status &quot;found&quot;. This must be rather new feature, i guess, i never noticed that before. Anyway, when logging a cache from c:geo one day later, setting the date to „yesterday“, the date shown after the cache status is today, not „yesterday“. So caches found 8th of november but logged on 9th of november with log date „yesterday“ are displayed as found on 9th of november. Interestingly enough, gc.com has a similar bug: I logged my first cache from Saarland one day late and manually set the date to one day before. Cache found date is correct, but the date i aquired the Saarland souvenir is wrong, it's the date i entered the log. But that is unrelated. I forgot: Nightly 2014-11-10-NB1-e0afb7

		From support mail (not yet verified): OU077B Saved cache description ok. I am using offline logs. Saved a basic &quot;found&quot; OK, but when adding to the log offline, it gives unable to retrieve needed info, or similar. Hit send log arrow. It gives a popup, &quot;loading log page OK&quot; Expected behavior: Work like GC.com.

			<description>
		From support mail: Sygic is not enabled as navigation method although Sygic is installed. Further investigation shows, that the users uses another Sygic app called &quot;Sygic voucher edition&quot;. The only difference should be an included activation code from some promotion. However I can reproduce that Sygic stays disabled in our navigation menu after the voucher edition has been installed like the user reports. I only don't know whether it is related to a difference within the different Sygic apps or just us by having a too strict check method?

As the caches are all offline I dont understand what kind of activity is going on here. Not reproducible, either it depends on the specific cache or the speed or availability of the network connection?!

		This issue was raised by SammysHP. It is not fully deterministic, but I was able to produce at least one affected cache with every try with the following recipe: Start c:geo, open live-map, switch off 'live' move to a region where no caches are stored, select a zoom level so that you expect &gt;~20 caches in the view switch on 'live', wait for the caches to be displayed select 'store offline' to a new list when the download is finished, the caches are still displayed as unreliable (I would have expected an update here) directly start opening caches and checking the log page for missing statistics I assume some sort of timing, but couldn't find any clues to that in the log

			<summary>c:geo crashes constantly on HTC Wildfire S with Android 2.3.5</summary>
			<url>https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/4568</url>
			<bugID>Issue #4568</bugID>
			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		I have HTC Wildfire S, HTC Sense 2.1, Android 2.3.5 with c:geo 2014.12.22 installed and 1196 caches in offline storage. The update section says (in German) &quot;No updates available for this phone. This phone is at the most recent status&quot;. The SQLite c:geo database seems to be OK (no errors reported with PRAGMA integrity_check) but I have used c:geo for quite a while so it may be that some entries do not comply with the current version's requirements... I use a prepaid card so c:geo is used exclusively offline (except when having a WiFi around and loading new caches). However, using c:geo I get crashes (&quot;Tut uns leid! Die Anwendung c:geo...&quot;) almost everywhere: opening the offline map (using OSM maps) logging in when first starting c:geo (rare and difficult to reproduce) when starting c:geo and Wireless has recently been disabled but c:geo still thinks it's logged in (shown in the bottom line &quot;login OK&quot;) when moving the map around or starting map view for a cache waypoint that had been opened from the map view already most importantly: when downloading one or several caches for offline use The last issue is very reproducible: Downloading more than three caches at once is a gamble with less than 5% chance of luck. More than four hasn't happened more often than once or twice in the last two years. It seems to increase when the GPS is on but this may only be a subjective impression. Downloading a single cache from the map view also leads to a definite crash in few cases, the most recent one being GC4Z71P (Jura-Höhenweg Teil 1). Map movement crashes are also easy to cause: Zoom out until more than ~200 caches are shown at once and simply move the map around a few times. Crash guaranteed. After a crash, sometimes c:geo reopens the map view automatically (rare case) or reopens itself automatically (frequent) or doesn't reopen at all (also frequent). Nothing else (except for sometimes BatteryBot Battery Indicator and sometimes Llama) is running in the background. I have debug logging enabled so there should be a few memory dumps. Is anyone interested in solving this issue so that I can send them in? I reject Google Play Services so reporting doesn't work (unfortunately). Best regards, Eingehirner

		When viewing my list of stored caches, if I select to sort by &quot;Date stored on device&quot; this works, and shows the oldest stored cache at the top of the list. If I then choose the menu option again to sort by &quot;Date stored on device&quot; the list is reversed, so that the most recently stored cache as as the top of the list (which I find more useful). However, if I then drop a cache from this list, the sort order is lost - specifically, the caches are sorted again with the oldest stored cache at the top of the list. Please allow my preference of having the most recently stored cache at the top of the list to be remembered.

		Split up from #4552 Following the above mentioned issue and the reports we get on support mail and Facebook we can break down current compass problem to this specific one: Device: HTC One (M7) Android: 4.4.3 Description: When rotating the phone the compass does not turn steady but will jump by 180° as soon as this angle is reached Same bevavior with the arrow on map Independently of Google Play Service settings Not yet tested if Low-power mode On/Off makes any difference At the same time other compass apps are working normal (i.e. the sensors itself seem to work fine) Current RC-version 2015.01.07-RC does not solve the problem I sent a video from a user showing that issue to the cgeo-dev mailing list on 07.01.2015. @arteos Can you kindly test if enabling &quot;Low power&quot; in c:geo Menu - Settings - System makes any difference for this issue? Can you please fall back to version 2014.11.04 (Download from here: https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/releases/tag/market_20141104) and check if the compass is normal in this version? There are also reports with HTC One Mini, Android 4.4.2 but sadly without a clear description whether it is the same problem (jumping by 180°). I will ask those users via support mail to describe in more detail.

		In #4552 and also on support mail an unusual amount of people are describing that a pure deinstallation + new installation of version 2014.12.22 solved their compass problem. All of them had the problem, that the compass was randomly moving or fixed to a random position and it was working normal in other compass apps at the same time. I was wondering if there is any &quot;default value&quot;, &quot;compass state&quot; or alike we store somewhere which is incorrect / out of range and might only get cleared on a new installation. This is the only reason I could imagine where a reinstallation could make any difference.

		2015.01.25-NB (also present in 2015.01.20 as reported on support mail). Happens also in other scenarios where the cache is opened directly from map. Not sure whether it is a regression, but I think so as I never noticed it before. Search for GC5K2A1 Open the cache details Note that the cache has a spoiler pic which is correctly indicated on the description tab Open the spoiler picture, is is shown normally. It is also visible on the image tab Select Navigate - Map Click on the cache to open popup Select more details Result: The link to the spoiler pic is missing on the description tab and the picture is not shown on the image tab. Selecting &quot;refresh&quot; will show it again until the next test cycle (unless the cache is saved).

		As of 2015-02-10, the MapQuest geocoder started to return 403 errors. It looks like this may be a larger issue as shown in: http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/forums/-/message_boards/message/1327001 As of 2015-02-11, the GeocoderTest.testMapQuestGeocoder test has been annotated with @Suppress. This annotation should be removed when the problem is solved, or when the MapQuest geocoder is removed from cgeo. Note that the unavailability of MapQuest does not impair the behaviour of cgeo in any way when other geocoders (Android, GC) are available.

		This is unreproducible right now, but while caching today I realized two times, that caches I was currently dealing with suddenly got marked as &quot;stored log&quot; while I did not actively do this. The offline logs contained my autoinserted signature. Trying it lateron I could not reproduce it. 2015.02.15-NB Option &quot;Log offline&quot; activated. Did anything change which could cause that?

			<description>
		Sometimes (unfortunately i cannot reproduce it), the text of the second waypoint is duplicated into the first for saved caches. Screenshot for GC4E28K: „Der Yogi bewacht C und D“ belongs to the second WP, Stage 1. Text for first WP (Start) is gone. This is different from #3420. The error is permanent and persists across refreshes of the saved cache. Also WP detail view shows the wrong text. Unfortunately, the error appears infrequently, and the circumstances are unclear to me. I noticed it 4-5 times during the last months, but never was annoyed enough to open an issue. Version 2015.02.16-NB, but i suspect the error occurs during saving of the cache, which was quite a long time ago now, and thus happened with an older version.

		The [NUMBER] placeholder is off by one in Twitter. I suppose that results from the way the value is formed in the tag engine, which I suspect to be $count+1 because the soon to be published log is one number higher than the current found count. The Twitter backend is called after logging, when $count was already incremented, resulting in the off-by-one bug.

		@samueltardieu added the ability to view and open embedded images under the &quot;Images&quot; tab after my posted issue #3661 Really great and useful! But far from all caches shows the image under the &quot;Images&quot; tab. These does include the image: http://coord.info/GC5NHA1 http://coord.info/GC4TZMH These does not include the image: http://coord.info/GC1EH4K http://coord.info/GC5NV7Q I suspect it has something to do with the file size of the image. That it does not show images below a certain file size to filter out language flags, smileys and other &quot;unwanted&quot; images. If I'm right that filter should be removed so that all images are shown. Or the file size threshold should at least be lowered.

		With 2015.03.28-NB1 (incl. Geokrety PR) I see the following problem: Each cache does only list one TB in the inventory list independently if GK connector is active or not.

Open it with 2015.03.28 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, both TBs are shown in Inventory-Tab Open with 2015.03.28-NB1 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, only one TB shown in inventory Another example (with mixed TB/GK): GC3FJ5F contains 2 TB and 1 GK (as of 28.03.2015 - Might change!) Open it with 2015.03.28 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, both TBs are shown in Inventory-Tab Open with 2015.03.28-NB1 --&gt; 2 TBs shown in list, only one TB and one GK shown in inventory It seems that now only 1 TB is shown

		When not actually viewing a geocache but simply selecting coordinates from the history list in the goto destination (bottom middle icon on cgeo home screen) you still have the new hint option at the top of the screen (even though there obviously isn't a hint) selecting this crashes cgeo - unfortauntely c:geo has stopped

		From facebook: I like c:geo a lot, but why does it (usually temporarily) count a NM log or a note as a find? Hi. It's strange, it's only a short term thing, but it increases the number of finds on the front page by one. It usually rectifies after logging out and in a couple of times. It obviously doesn't register on the gc.com site, as the count remains correct on there. Thanks for a great app though, and thanks for looking at a very minor niggle! Actually, we increase the find count on logging, independent of the type of the actual log. See GCParser 1176.

			<description>
		I open a new issue instead of commenting on the closed issue #4725. Is this the right way to do it? I think that the fix by @Bananeweizen did only solve half of the problem though. The behavior is still illogical when trying to deselect the search bar by pressing the back key. When you first press the search bar, the last shown caches are shown in the dropdown and the keyboard is shown, allowing you to enter a search query. When you select a cache from the list the search bar gets deselected in the correct way. Showing the default controls in the action bar next time you come back to the home page. Perfect! But when you press the back button instead, the first state is like the below screenshot, This step is unnecessary since you cannot enter anything in the search field anyway when the keyboard is hidden When you press the back button a second time this action bar is shown: ...instead of the default action bar setup below that should be shown instead: So my suggestion is that you should only have to press the back button once to deselect the search field.

			<description>
		2015.04.16-NB We had such an issue on support mail (or even here as an issue) but I was not able to reproduce or find a hint in our code: This morning at approx. 06:30am CEST I logged two TB (retrieve log) I am quite sure that the log date shown in c:geo was 17.04. (which would be correct) but I did not explicitly verify it , at least I did not change it manually Looking this evening at the website I see that those logs have the date 16.04. (e.g. http://www.geocaching.com/track/log.aspx?LUID=58d79e3f-56d5-4595-bbbe-326b8add5390) The time zone settings of my device (Galaxy S4, Android 5.0.1) is set to factory value, i.e. derive from mobile network. Checking the world clock app it confirms the timezone used as GMT+2 (which is correct). Can someone check if we send the log with just the absolute date or do we try to transmit a time and time zone info as well?

		I use c:geo for offline caching, but lately I've been having an issue where any field notes it exports are blank. At first I thought it was an error in uploading to geocaching.com, but I checked the field notes folder on my HTC's drive, and all the recent ones are blank. At the moment I am just logging my caches offline, then going into history and exporting them. This has been working perfectly for several months, but on my last holiday it stopped and I have had to log everything manually, which has been a huge hassle. Is this a bug, or do I need to be doing something different?

		The GPS coordinates in the details pages is note good. In the description is the right one but when you try to navigate or look on google map, with the GPS coordinates you had locked, it's wrong. This problem happened in the geocaching place made by Braconne Charente in the web site https://www.geocaching.com/ Can you fixe it? Thank you

			<summary>Geocache details page crashes occasionally</summary>
			<url>https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/4922</url>
			<bugID>Issue #4922</bugID>
			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		For some months, c:geo sometimes crashes when displaying the geocache details page. Unfortunately, this bug is not reproducible (can't trigger it directly) but still happens quite often during normal use. I'm running Android 4.4.4 (Samsung S3 LTE, not rooted) with recent releases of c:geo (from Google Play store). I've send a couple of those automated bug reports (usually like &quot;crash while viewing cache details&quot;), but today's crash (5.5.2015) starts with the (hopefully unique) label &quot;AMK4711A&quot;, just in case you want to debug this specific crash. There are two ways the crash happens. (1) When I'm on the map screen (OpenAndroMaps locally stored) and touch a geocache icon (traditional, geocaching.com), a small overlay window opens. There I can touch &quot;More details&quot; to launch the geocache details page. And this is when the crashes happen. (2) When I'm editing the &quot;Personal note&quot; of a geocache and touch &quot;OK&quot; to return to the geocache details page, then c:geo also is likely to crash. It doesn't matter if GPS, WLAN or Mobile networks (or any combination of it) is switched on or off. There's plenty of memory and disk space available (usually, c:geo is the only app actively running). Rebooting the phone doesn't change anything. The only common thing of all the crashes is that they always happen when the geocache details page(s) is going to be displayed. There's no crash by just switching back and forth between the sub-pages of the geocache details (like waypoints, overview, description, logs etc.) If you need additional information, please let me know. If it helps I can assign the same &quot;unique&quot; label (see above) to future crash reports so they can be referenced easily.

		Summary: Refreshing all caches in a list caused repeated caches to be displayed on screen with different information. I had 14 caches stored in my &quot;Found List&quot; and I was logging them on my computer. When I completed my logging (on the computer) I did a &quot;Refresh All&quot; in c:geo and the caches refreshed. (I wanted to verify that I hadn't missed logging any.) What was displayed after that was a combination of &quot;unfound&quot; caches and &quot;found&quot; caches of the same name. It appeared to have not cleared the previous state properly before reloading the cache. To clarify: Some caches were displayed twice, once with the &quot;Cache Found&quot; green bar, and once without. See attached screen shot. Exiting the list and re-entering refreshed the display correctly.

		Starting with 2015.05.22-NB1 I seem to have extreme inconsistencies on my lists of saved caches. Example: I open a list named GdH with 15 caches I open one of them and close it again Returning to the list I do see that all caches shown belong to the history list but not my list The header still shows GdH as name but a count of 81 caches (which is the amount of caches in the history list) Leaving and reentering the lists solves it Trying to explitcitly reproduce it was not succesfull, but it keeps happening in various ways.

		Open a cache, go to the description page. For demonstration immediately decrypt the hint. One or two seconds later the detail page is recreated and the hint is encrypted again (and the long description is hidden). Maybe setDataSetChanged() is called a few seconds after the first creation of the page.

		I installed 2015.05.29-RC and restored a backup of 2015.05.28-NB. After that I do see some caches on my list which have inventory icons (one or several TB numbered) but If I open the cache the inventory tab is not shown. The GC website confirms, that there are no TBs listed in this cache, still it keeps showing in the list even after refresh of the cache. Note: Tested for me with GC50HFV

		Similarly to a bug we discussed long ago I again experience funny stuff when using the share menu. When I select the &quot;show all&quot; from the android share menu provider then locus opens with the cache. This is surely a faulty way through the switch case of the onOptionsItemSelected of the cache details activity.

		There seem to be many users (judged by the amount of support mails and bad GooglePlay ratings) having stability problems with c:geo after upgrading their devices to Android 5.0.x. This seems to be an issue which is maybe independend of #4921 For some of them the problem seems solved after a factory reset, but a lot others keep having problems. I have the chance to get a Sony Xperia Z3 tomorrow and will try to see if I can reproduce the general instability. @rsudev What was that device you are using? Did you see any regular crashes of c:geo on it?

		Previously Inventory was in alphabetical name order when you were logging a cache. Since the last update, a new little icon is next to them, but it is no longer in alphabetical order. This makes it very time consuming to scroll thru and find the ones you want.

 Couldn't we do this in the background not blocking the UI? Looking back at #4074 I tend to remember that the unavailable pictures was not blocking the UI in the past but did &quot;only&quot; prevent all other pictures from beeing shown. So I would assume (although I did not explicitly test this before) that the blocking behaviour is new.

		When I export and upload my fieldnotes to gc.com I always get the popup-mesage &quot;upload to geocaching.com successfull&quot; - even if there is no internet-connection and nothing could be submitted. Sometimes the mobile data connection is not so good and I lost my fieldnotes this way. I can reproduce the bug when I disable wifi and mobile-data and try to upload the fieldnotes! Even an error-message-popup displaying for one second would not be the best solution because it is easy to overlook and there is now possibility for a second try because the last-upload-date was updated. But an success-message in case of failure is really bad.

		It seems that c:geo does not update what it thinks it my current location after it has been started. Two things that happened yesterday: Start c:geo wth location still turned off Turn on location Wait until OsmAnd sees me in my current location Select &quot;Nearby&quot;, &quot;Current location&quot; in c:geo c:geo selects caches on the wrong continent, it seems to use the previous location I have been searching... Later, I restarted c:geo. Then at least it had me in the right city, but Select a cache Click the circle with the four bars at the top, so that there's a circle filling it Walk around c:geo does not update my current location The &quot;location service&quot; icon does not even appear in Android's status bar. When I switch to OsmAnd, it does appear, and the blue spot follows my walking. This is using c:geo 2015.08.03 on a device without play services, but with open-source replacements for some of them. (Not that I think that matters, but who knows^^).

		This one is hard to describe, so I give you the sequence: 2015.08.28-NB Open a found mystery cache Create a new final WP and activate &quot;Set coords on webpage&quot;, save it Immediately go to the cache details page and press &quot;Add to favorites&quot; before uploading the coords to the website finished I can't exactly remember the reaction of c:geo but it was not OK. This leads to either a failure message for setting the favorite point or no feedback to the user for both actions. Sorry, happend already some days ago, and I wasn't able to reproduce as it needs quite a slow network connection. After refreshing the cache I have seen, that both operations have been sucesfull (coords set and fav point added). Not a big deal as the occurence will be quite rare.

		2015.08.30-NB1 It seems either there is a problem with event cache GC60RZK or it is not possible to add an event which is in the past? If this is intentional I vote for removing that restriction. The missing option is not really intuitive and it should be up to the user whether he wants to add an event in the past. Additionally there seem to be problems with users on some timezones (maybe erratically set on their phone) leading to fail to add it due to the missing menu.

		From support mail (related to cgeo 2015.09.23): I received the latest update to c:geo last night and immediately noticed one problem: when I use the &quot;Live Map&quot; to view caches, even though I have all cache types selected, multi caches that I haven't found are not displayed . There are several night cache (which display as multis) that I have not saved for off-line use. None of these caches are displayed. I normally do not save night caches for off-line unless I intend to attempt them in the near future. Let me know if others have had this problem. I am using an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5). I cannot reproduce this (launch cgeo without any filter, live map, I can see multicaches, including in areas where I have no caches stored). Can other developers check if they can reproduce this problem?

The overlay does only seem to work if the function &quot;replace listing coords by final waypoint&quot; has been used while creating the waypoint. This should not be necessary for the overlay to appear in the list. I assume the bug was introduced with recent changes to the overlay design in lists as it used to work with older c:geo versions.

 @samueltardieu Is it really possible that the device does not provide rotation sensor but only orientation?

			<description>
		A lot of people contacted support mail because of this. The problem started after update to a newer version of this mapy.cz app, however I sill want to share this here as I don't know whether mapy.cz has a bug or we do use a special implementation for this app which is no longer valid for some reason now. Here is a good problem description from support. I have set as secondary navigation external source - application mapy.cz. The connection between c:geo and mapy.cz worked well until last big update of mapy.cz. Now, when I want to show cache in mapy.cz, it doesn't work. Through c:geo is opened application mapy.cz, but coordines are no shown (this worked before). It only works when I copy coordinates in format DD.DDDDD from c:geo to mapy.cz and I have to change &quot;,&quot; for &quot;.&quot; because it is copied from c:geo with &quot;,&quot;, but it doesn't work in mapy.cz with &quot;,&quot;.

			<description>
		Folllowing info from support mail (and I have also seen this happening once in a while). It seems that the process is triggered which should merge the notes between local and server although there is no server communication involved. Here is the info from support mail: Problem's scenario: save a cache offline, add a personal note, save it and leave the cache return to the cache with the previously saved personal note re-edit the note (change some stuff, perhaps use copy 'n paste) and save it --&gt; the personal note is duplicated, with a &quot;--&quot; line between the copies Most sadly this is not deterministic. And although I tested and checked a lot, I cannot say which steps lead to this behavior, nor which conditions &quot;must&quot; be fulfilled to let it happen. Moreover it does not happen with every cache, but if it happened once, it happens every time I change the note of this cache. What I can say: It does not matter if I have previously uploaded the personal note or not; it does not matter where the cursor stands in the text; it seems to not matter if I use copy 'n paste or not.

		Does anyone have experience with c:geo on an Android 6.0 device? From support mail: My &quot;guess&quot; is that &quot;something&quot; within my recent update to Android v6.0 Marshmallow has changed how the state of Google Play Services &quot;appears&quot; to the C:Geo app. (appears to be disabled). [...] MAPS and CALENDAR seem to work fine...........but C:Geo still displays &quot;GPS disabled&quot; when I have your System/Use Google Play Services enabled (checked). So I'm &quot;guessing&quot; that Play services may well be active, but it appears to C:geo to be disabled. Alternatively, there may be something unique about my Android v6.0 and Nexus 7 (2013) which is disabling c:Geo's access to that service. Who knows?

			<description>
		..or improve it to make it more reliable. Several users contact us regularly having problems with strange waypoints automatically created by parsing of the personal note. There seem to be cases, where we parse nonsense. One example I received today: Personal note content:    A=6 B=0 C=5 D=4 E=13

   N 48° 53.(A*C*E)+194   E 009° 11.((D*71)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.(6*5*13)+194  E 009° 11.((4*71)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.(390)+194     E 009° 11.((284)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.584           E 009° 11.283
 c:geo creates the following waypoint as parsing result: N 48° 53,000  E 006° 00,000
 This means users might see a lot of incorrect waypoints on their map without a possibility to permanentely remove them. So I suggest to either improve the parsing or add an option to disable it in general so that affected users have a solution.

If I use it for ie 10 caches all is OK. If I use it for ie 200 caches, I haven't tab Listing in Locus. I guess there is some limitation in the amount of data we can hand over?!

			<description>
		This is a feature request for the possibility to allow personal notes waypoint import after changing the personal notes. Use case example: Go on a multi cache hunt Store the cache locally Write down A, B, C, etc. in the personal notes section of the multi cache Calculate the final coord by switching between personal notes and a calculator app back and forth. When done, you have the final coord written down in your personal notes. Now you have to swipe left twice and hit the &quot;Add waypoint&quot; button to add the final coords. The little window opens and you have to put in the numbers. My personal problem here is that I can't kepp more than 5 numbers in mind, so I enter the North coordinate, hit the tick symbol, go back to personal notes, read the East coord, go back to waypoints and enter the East coordinate. (You see, this workflow works and the app does what it should, but it could be easier for the user I think.) Expected behavior: I personally see two possible improvements: Expect the app to parse my personal notes after saving for something like &quot;Final: N 47.123 E 8 33.123&quot; and create the waypoint accordingly. Highlight the coord in the personal notes and allow the user by clicking on it to choose &quot;Add to waypoints&quot; or &quot;Update existing waypoint&quot;... something like that Version of c:geo used: Not relevant System information: Not relevant Other comments and remarks: I love caching and your app since 2011 - big thanks to you guys!

 I remember having seen this kind of exception before but it did not influence the app function. We might even already have this issue somewhere (but I could not find it). New is, that c:geo freezes. Is this related to the recently introduced &quot;Abort on log.e&quot;?

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Start downloading an online search result list Cancel at some point in between Actual behavior after performing these steps: The online search result list is refreshed and all caches have the offline marker. But in fact, not all have been stored. When randomly clicking caches from the list now, some open immediately, and some will be downloaded first (the ones we cancelled).

		From support mail: All worked well until I upgraded to Maps.me 6.0.7 Looking at a list of 40 caches and selecting &quot;Show on a map&quot;, then Maps.me There are 40 green dots around where I am standing, GOOD. I tap a dot. It comes up with box and words c:geo and the co-ordinates. I tap the arrow labelled &quot;Back&quot;, it then quickly shows a message that it cannot download cache details, and return to the list. The one nearest is top of the list. But I want to research other around and have no idea which is which Previously (before the Maps upgrade) it came up with the cache name, and if I did a back arrow, it then opened that cache's description. So it seems that the interchange parameters to Maps.me has changed with this new version. Please can you look into it? Android 4.1.1 C:geo 2016 05 09

		Hi c:geo team, Detailed steps causing the problem: Go into an offline list with tens of caches Go to the end (for example), select a cache, move the cache in another list by using the &quot;move&quot; button (or long press the cache, select &quot;move in another list&quot; choice in the menu) Actual behavior after performing these steps: After moving the cache, we are back to the beginning of the list Expected behavior after performing these steps: Stay to the last known position in the list before moving the cache Version of c:geo used: 2016.05.09 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Attach system information here if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; System)
 Other comments and remarks: Thanks, Tof

		Import the 3 lab cache GPX files from GC55555. Cache number 10 will always overwrite the existing cache number 10. This is because our GPX parser wrongly thinks that the &quot;10 - some name&quot; indicates the geocode 10, therefore overwriting the previously existing cache.

		I logged a trackable this morning at 6:10 German time. When I refreshed the trackable afterwards, it was shown logged yesterday. I had not changed the date selector, so I'm somewhat sure it was not set to yesterday. Might this be a problem with the time offset of -7 hours that we use somewhere? I can't verify this behaviour at the moment, since I have no private tracking code available. Will re-test one of the next days with my own trackables.

		From support mail: I would like to describe you a small problem with sending coordinates to external applications (in this case mapy.cz). The problem is that when you send those coordinates, mapy.cz will only show a label (picture) without a pin with exact position (picture). And I would like to point out that it has to work offline as well. It would really make user experience better not only for me, but for many Czech geocachers. Keep up the good work! Thanks. 2016.06.09

		From FB and support mail: Navigating using maps.me from cgeo is no longer working (no target shown in maps.me). Happens if both apps are on latest available release, works again when downgrading maps.me to previous official version. So either an API change on maps.me which we need to follow or simply a bug of maps.me.

		Beta feedback: Mapsforge BETA glitch? Sunday entered corrected cords for a puzzle cache but didn't move the cache marker just kept it as the red reference point mark. When flipped back to original maps and cache location had moved to new corrected coords but going back the icons had swapped again. PS love the new Mapsforge much clearer detail.

		Sine this morning we get complaints about freezing/crashing live map. I can reproduce this after short usage of the live map. As it wasnt the case last days I assume we have a server issue one again (or still) where cgeo crashes instead of catching the error and giving a proper error message. Maybe someone can reproduce and provide a log. IMHO we should urgently fix this because people blame cgeo for this.

 Assigning to @Bananeweizen in case this is due to recent Gradle upgrades and he knows how to fix this.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open GC4C67W It has a final waypoint without valid coords (as the owner probably decided to make it visible but hide its coords) Store the cache Open the (live) map of that region Actual behavior after performing these steps: The cache is shown with the final marker on the map Expected behavior after performing these steps: The final marker should not be shown, as the final waypoint has no valid coords Version of c:geo used: 2016.08.27 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: Up to approx. March 2016 this was implemented as suggested but changed thereafter. Users are complaining as they are no longer able to differentiate between real modified mystery final coords and those &quot;dummy&quot; caches. I have in mind, that I already have seen such an issue but can't find it.

		Short version as I am on mobile only: Current nightly Searched for an address Mapped the result Selected &quot;Save for offline&quot; from map menu Result: Toast is shown with something like &quot;Nothing to save&quot; although unsaved caches are on the map Might be related to new map (did not test old map/google map)

		Have a cache with a parking lot waypoint. Open the map for the cache and look at the final and the parking lot icons. Everything fine. Now open the map from the parking lot waypoint instead. The icon is no longer a parking icon, but a reference point icon.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Log a cache find and attach picture with the log (GC.com) Send the log Actual behavior after performing these steps: An error message is shown, that sending seems failed and user shall check on website (retry/cancel/offline). Expected behavior after performing these steps: This occured to me on the last 14 days for each picture I attched, so something seems wrong while checking the result. In all cases log and picture had been uploaded correctly. Version of c:geo used: Master Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes (at least it seems like that to me...can't do extensive tests right now) Other comments and remarks: Feel free to test with my owned caches to check whether reproducible

		Feature request Hi guys, thanks for your great job! It is possible to display the background-image of a cache-listing in c:geo? If the picture is in the gallery than its shown in cgeo. But often the background is not in the gallery and in this case it will not be shown. I hope that will be possible. Thanks and best regards king-ton

It seems either the home coords are not working on the website or we fail when parsing them.

		New map active (mapsforge beta) Open live map Enable live Select a cache to show its popup Press the &quot;route button&quot; (circle with angled arrow) A direct line is shown from current position to cache. Top shows distance, I presume it is direct distance. No route seems to be calculated. BRouter is installed and configured for car-test and started in server mode. BRouter has appropriate data already downloaded. Tested and confirmed working using it within OSMAND. in c:geo there is no indication that BRouter is detected, or even if there is such depedency. User has no way of determining if c:geo and BRouter work together or not. Line visual theme (simple red with slight alpha) shown from position to cache (or presumably would be route) is visually not well represented. Assume it is shown as route properly, in sample screen, it would almost be indistinguishable over the red primary roads there. Could be related to #6017 Parts of this issue were conceptually defined here #6033 before being discovered.

		Noticed in master. This should be modernized to use RxJava to benefit from fine scheduler control, parallelism, and ability to cancel requests properly, instead of using a thread. The StaticMapsProvider is already reactive. Also, some operations (such as the refresh operation from the menu) appear to block on the UI thread.

		It would be nice when caching in remote areas where cell reception is on again off again, that when you hit upload on the personal note page, that it is queued up to send when you get back into cell reception. Currently, the only way to know if it was sent or not, is if GC.COM is missing a personal note.

		This is more or less a reminder to myself (and others who would like to test): Some user reports for the current RC version (2016.11.28-RC) tell, that there are problems in the history: Offline logged caches not visible History cannot be emptied History is emptied but cache count in title bar still shows x caches on list I cannot reproduce any of them right now, but as we had a change in this area I think there might be some leftover bug under special conditions. I will try to gather more information from users and try to test some things myself. 👍 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Remember the amount of saved caches on your lists as shown on the mainscreen as X Open live map Click on a non-detailed cache (with orange circle) From the popup select Log Visist Enter log text and press back to save the log Actual behavior after performing these steps: Cache icon has now markers for offline logged and saved(?) Saved caches amount on main screen is now x+1 Cache is not visible in lists Cache is visible in history Opening this cache in history will show the non-detailed status: Empty description, Empty logbook Cache details screen shows &quot;Saved on device 11746 days ago&quot; Expected behavior after performing these steps: I don't know enough about the DB structure to judge the best way of fixing this. However from a user perspective: It should show up in the history (as it does) It should not count to the amount of total caches stored in lists as it is not part of any list contained there It should not show up with saved icon on map Version of c:geo used: 2016.12.10-NB Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes Other comments and remarks: This seems to be not caused by the change of @pstorch (ded3fb7) as the behaviour is the same with this fix (fresh RC) and without this fix (current nightly).

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open an unsaved caches Select Menu (three dot) Actual behavior after performing these steps: No menu item &quot;Extract waypoints&quot; visible unless the cache is saved Expected behavior after performing these steps: We should avoid such dependencies as it also makes the feature less acessible. Instead I suggest autosaving the cache (same as when a user edits a waypoint of an unsaved cache) as soon as the function is selected Version of c:geo used: 2017.02.04-NB Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes

		While investigatin #6413 we found that we use CloseQuietly() although it is only supported starting with API level 16 (our minsdk is 14 now). There are only rare crash reports on Google Play however we have like 30 occurences in the code. So either we remove it or raise minsdk again to 16 which would close out all Android versions below 4.1.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Move geocache data from external to internal In the dialog before moving it shows &quot;xMB used&quot; (x=282,2 in my case) Move geocache data again from internal to external In the dialog before moving it shows &quot;yMB used&quot; (y=192,4 in my case) Move geocache date again from external to internal Actual behavior after performing these steps: In the dialog before moving it now shows &quot;0B used&quot; Actually also the progress is getting much faster now (almost instantly). Expected behavior after performing these steps: First we need to find out what actually happens here. Is the data still moved or do we count less data and also move less data?

			<description>
		Using c:geo I have encountered (for unknown reasons) errors while submitting logs (with all my trackables set to &quot;visited&quot;). The message was smth like &quot;error posting log, please try again&quot;. Today I looked into my GC account from a PC and found that for caches where I encountered such errors I discovered that I actually posted several logs to that cache, instead of just one. In fact, there was a log posted for each attempt I made. Clearly posting a cache log and then posting a log for each trackable is done in the same thread (as regard to error handling) and the error message I got was erroneous, by that I mean: actual cache log was successfully posted the error happened for one of the trackables log (&quot;visited&quot;) I was left in the situation to retry to post the cache log, even though it was successfully posted the first time. I worked around by not visiting my trackables. Also note that it happened for many caches, but never for &quot;found logs&quot;. I encountered the problem with DNF and Needs maintenance.

		Just built a new nightly to take a first look at the waypoint calculator. I had no time to test in details, so just a short try where I either found a bug or still have a misunderstanding of the working mode. Detailed steps causing the problem: Start with a new calculation Assign A to F to the last lat and lon digits Enter formulas for A to F where A=a , B=b, C=c-b Actual behavior after performing these steps: When entering B=b the variable input field for b is shown, when entering C=c-b a new variable field for c is shown but the field for b is gone Expected behavior after performing these steps: Variable input b should stay Version of c:geo used: 2017.07.29-NB1 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Android 7.0 Other comments and remarks: I added a new label &quot;WP Calc&quot; to get a better overview for issues regarding the new WP calculator.

 Other comments and remarks: Got this issue reported from a friend. After moving the map to the internal storage c:geo found it. In the last refactoring with the new storage concept we haven't touched the Maps directories. There is some special logic (device dependent?) to find the mounted devices. Maybe this needs some rework.

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		This was probably introduced with #6759 and seems to be caused by a change to the 'Plain Format' text field. The change gets triggered sometime between when the 'textListener' is added in onCreateView(...) and when the calculator's state is loaded in onResume(). The actual crash is caused by accessing the currentFormat variable before it is initialised but I can't for the life of me workout what is causing the text to be changed prior to the onResume() call. In any event simply protecting the reference to currentFormat with &quot;if null&quot; checks alleviates the problem but I would have preferred to isolate the cause of the text changed event in the first place but can't seem to find it.
