			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		When browsing either the contacts app or the dialler app on lollipop, in my case both apps are Google's apps, tapping on a contact you have never sent a SMS to before seems to create an empty thread in Qksms. This is a pain as if you tap on a landline number, it is always certain to create an empty thread. This can lead to having multiple empty threads at the top of the app to scroll through unless deleting them everytime. Screenshot below:

		Hey Shane- Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. So here's what I've figured out: -I can send pictures, as long as I used the camera app first to take the picture, by selecting the picture from my gallery through your app. -If I try to take a picture through through your app, that's when I have the issue. It will take the picture but never send. -I've tried with WiFi on and off for both scenarios and, at least for me, the WiFi status doesn't matter. So in the end, I can now use MMS. I just have to take my picture first using my camera app, then send it. I am able to receive pictures without any issues though. Thank You, ---

		After deleting multiple threads on an LG G5, on current Android build. A new text will come in. In the app view it says the wrong contact, when clicking on the message it then shows the proper contact who sent the message. Replies are sent to both recipients until the thread is deleted, or application is force stopped. This happens after reinstallation, clearing cache, any time you receive a message shortly after deleting multiple threads. Steps to reproduce: Have multiple SMS threads in inbox Delete all but 1 Thread (Optional) Receive a new message from a new recipient Reply to the non-deleted thread Expected Behavior: Message will be sent to displayed recipient. Current Behavior: Message is sent to the recipient of one of the deleted threads, not the displayed recipient, and a new messaging thread to the unintended recipient will be created. Appears to send message to the recipient of the most current, deleted thread. Workaround: Force Closing the application This has occurred on multiple phones and across updates to Android, the LG G3, G4, and a Nexus 5.

While invisible, timestamps and such just act as if there's a bubble there when there isn't.

		DESCRIPTION I'm having issues sending/receiving MMS messages while connected to a VPN. I used to think this was Wifi issue but after more troubleshooting it turns out it's the VPN. STEPS Connect to VPN (such as OpenVPN) Try to send/receive MMS EXPECTED The message should be received/sent without issue. OBSERVATIONS I think I may have found the solution to this problem. I started trying many different texting apps while troubleshooting my MMS issue and ended up finding a setting in Textra called &quot;MMS Behavior&quot;. By default it's set to &quot;Legacy&quot; and under that it says &quot;Try 'System' if legacy MMS isn't work (for example with Project Fi, VPNs, WiFi MMS, etc).&quot; So I then set it to &quot;System&quot; and it appears to have fixed the problem. I have seen this option in other apps such as YAATA SMS and ChompSMS. Is this something that could be added? I'm not sure how difficult something like this would be to add because I'm not a programmer. It seems like maybe it's just a switch saying use the system settings on the phone instead of the app settings. Hopefully it's something simple and easy that can be added to this app! For the time being I am just using Textra because I don't want to miss out on messages but I prefer QKSMS over any of the messaging apps I've tried! Even with all the different customizations on the other apps I still want to come back to this one :) üëç 2

		DESCRIPTION The app crashes if the quick reply window is drawn over the app itself, apparently only if it's reached from the lock screen. STEPS Open QK. Lock the screen with the power button, or allow it to lock itself. Receive a text message. Turn on the screen and hit 'Reply' on the notification. 5a. Type a reply and hit send. OR 5b. Dismiss the quick reply window. EXPECTED The reply window should simply close. If a message has been typed when the window is dismissed then it should be saved to draft. If a message had been SENT then it should in fact be sent, after which the quick reply window should simply close. OBSERVATIONS The screen will go dark and revert to the conversations menu, and if attempting to send a message then said message is not sent, nor is it saved as a draft. It simply disappears.

		DESCRIPTION I'm just testing QKSMS; I have used the stock SMS app until now. Whenever I want to see the report of a message which has not been sent with QKSMS (rather with the stock app of Android 5.1.1), QKSMS crashes. The reason might be that the stock app did not store all the time stamps (only time sent, but not time delivered). However, since all the information in the message report is also contained in the dialog &quot;message details&quot;, it is not a big issue and the dialog &quot;message report&quot; could be just removed. STEPS open message thread and navigate to an older message, which has not been sent with QKSMS. long-press the time stamp to open the context menu choose &quot;view report&quot; (Bericht ansehen in German) EXPECTED A dialogue window opens showing the message report dialog with the receiver's number, receiving status, delivery time. OBSERVATIONS The app crashes and is getting closed.

		DESCRIPTION When a MMS or group message is received, QKSMS does not produce any notification - no sound, popup, icon, anything. The only way you can tell if a new message was received is if the app is opened, and a thread has the new message dot on it. Normal SMS messages are notifying as expected. STEPS Receive MMS or group message Wonder what your friend is talking about when they ask why you didn't respond to their message EXPECTED To receive a notification exactly like receiving SMS's. OBSERVATIONS Absolutely nothing observable occurs when an MMS or group message is received. However, if one opens the QKSMS app, it does show as new in there.

			<description>
		DESCRIPTION There are transitions in QKSMS that cannot be disabled if Animation off is set in Android's Developer options. These settings effectively disable all the transitions in apps and system, except for certain particular transitions in some games. But QKSMS is an ordinary semi-lightweight Modern Look app, so it should have its transitions implemented with standard Android API functions. This bug reports concentrates on the fact that the transition is non-standard, so this is not a duplicate of #497 (nor #529) - but it would probably solve them both. STEPS Go to the conversation Return to inbox EXPECTED Inbox is displayed as fast as possible. OBSERVATIONS Weird, slow transition appears which unnecessarily delays the display of expected screen while also producing a few bugs. Inbox is displayed, but not as fast as possible.

		DESCRIPTION For example, the long SMS has been split into 4 short SMS. The 1/4 and 2/4 have been received on the side of recipient, but 3/4 and 4/4 will wait several second to be received. Or sometimes 3/4 and 4/4 are even not received, until that the conversation continues (sender or recipient sends some new SMS), the old non-received SMS will be received. Quite frequent. STEPS Install QKSMS 2.7.1 Activate option &quot;Split SMS&quot; in Settings Send a long SMS to the recipient EXPECTED No delay OBSERVATIONS There is delay

		DESCRIPTION With the markdown syntax activated the underscore contained in urls will be deleted because of markdown. So the URL will be incorrect and the user will get a 404 error. STEPS Activate markdown syntax ; Send yourself an URL like this http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3guigq_funny-animals-keyboard-cat-96-tears_animals ; Click on the URL ; Get a 404 error because the URL was reformated and is not good anymore. EXPECTED The URL should not be reformated. OBSERVATIONS The underscore in the URL are used as markdown marks so they are removed from the url. PATCH I will be treated as a clown but a simple patch consists to inactivate markdown for the message if it contains an URL. Here is a quick and dirty patch : https://framabin.org/?7db6d7ef7dc80b19#XhSyE7pM1a4fm7sfVOmjOZU3wqQ8bYuLbhSVUjEZuVA= DISCUSSIONS I think that it is important to discuss this problem because it is not as simple as it seems. My solution is clearly not good, but it is pretty hard to handle correctly URL because what is exactly an URL ? In QKSMS it seems that \w{\w|\d}*.\w+ is an URL, but how are we supposed to handle an URL like this : http://wayback.archive.org/web/\*/http://google.com (remove the backslash before the asterisk) or the one I gave in example above. I know that using hyphens in URL should be preferred over using underscore. So I do not think that it is possible to handle ALL the URL but we can clearly find a better solution than mine.

		DESCRIPTION Moto 4 Android 6.0.1 I set ( in general settings) Starred contacts to show. This is useful as a type of work-around to make it easier to send group SMS. However I then saw that after adding say 8 or 9 in the compose screen - I regularly send an SMS to a group of 10 - the compose screen send to section became too cluttered. When I went back and switched off Starred Contacts the setting restored itself to on ( albeit with the arrow pointing left beside the &quot;STARRED CONTACTS&quot; text in the compose screen - the actual contacts not showing but the &quot;STARRED CONTACTS&quot; text remaining). A further visit to the general settings screen showed the option slider to have restored itself to the right i.e. on. This persisted after a restart and an uninstall and reinstall STEPS Switch general settings to show starred contacts Note that the compose screen now shows starred contacts ( 4 across) Switch starred contacts off in the general settings screen &quot;STARRED CONTACTS&quot; remains in the compose screen General setting slider has gone back to to the right EXPECTED All reference to starred contacts should disappear from the compose screen OBSERVATIONS I note that in settings &quot;QK Compose&quot; the text says &quot;QK Compose, starred contacts.

		Just upgraded from 2.5.4 and want to say thanks for all of your work, especially: fixed rotation support fixed scrolling to the bottom all the time timestamps for messages are now configurable Cheers! :-) However: When you press the back button from a conversation to the message list, it flickers to the background briefly before showing what it should. Kinda annoying and a regression IMO. My contacts which have names STILL show just the number in some certain cases. This is old but I was hoping it'd be fixed by now. These from five minutes playing around. Will add anything new that I find tomorrow. Too late to send SMSes now.

JRE: 1.8.0_76-release-b03 x86_64
JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o
 Gradle version 2.2.0 EXPECTED The app builds without fail. OBSERVATIONS I'm getting a lot of &quot;errors&quot; that look like this: warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class
(freemarker.cache.FileTemplateLoader$2) that doesn't come with an
associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a
compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended
solution is to recompile the class from source, using an up-to-date compiler
and without specifying any &quot;-target&quot; type options. The consequence of ignoring
this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
indicate that it is *not* an inner class.
 (They appear as errors in Android Studio.) These are all the errors I'm getting. I think it's printing an error for every class in the freemarker.* package.

			<description>
		Hi, I love using qksms and have had it as my default SMS client for several months now. However, I noticed that overtime when using it it has become very unresponsive and can sometimes take a long time to switch to the task. Often times this coincides with hitting the back button returning me to the same conversation multiple times as well as other conversations which I might have closed out of or moved away from earlier. I don't know if this is intended Behavior, but there doesn't seem to be a limit to how large the activity stack can be. Regardless of whether or not this is a bug, it seems like a workaround solution can happen if the app has some kind of hard limit to the amount of activities it can generate on that stack. Preferably, I'd like to be able to have the back button always return me to the conversation list if I'm in a conversation thread. Thanks for reading!

		Changing the icon colour kills QKSMS stone dead and deletes the icon from the launcher. Takes around a second or so for QKSMS to realize it's dead. QKSMS is truly removed from the launcher, there's no active spot with an invisible icon, just a dead space. QKSMS cannot be added back to the launcher unless the icon colour is reset to the default (white) colour first. This occurs using the Nova launcher with QKSMS in the dock. I also tried it with QKSMS on the home page but not in the dock. The first time I tried it outside the dock I got a pop-up telling me it had died and did I want to restart it, but when I tried to restart it nothing happened. The other times I've tried it with QKSMS outside the dock I didn't get that pop-up. Note that I've only tried it outside the dock four times (and got the pop-up once) and tried it in the dock many times and not seen the pop-up. Note that I'm using Jina as my drawer and use it to add QKSMS to the home screen. This may be why nothing seems to happen when I try to add non-white QKSMS to home screen, but is more likely down to Nova itself rejecting the attempt, resulting in Jina failing to confirm that QKSMS has been added to home screen (because it hasn't). May be related to #395 and/or #141. Or not. :) This is on Android 7.1.1. QKSMS 2.7.3 (I signed up for beta last night but playstore hasn't caught up yet). Nova 5.3. Jina 3.0.7ga881

		I looked for a bug report with the same issue but couldn't find one so I apologize if this is a duplicate. I noticed that if you long press on a conversation a modal pops up but I think the text is white on the white background. If I press in the bottom right corner of the modal, it will delete the conversation so the action is available, you just can't read what's in the modal. Let me know if you need further clarification.

		Galaxy Note 4, Android 6.0.1 Upon first launch of the app, it will load and attempt to update the database, but it never does. I've left it for like 20 minutes. So I close the app, attempt to re-open, and get an instant force close/crash. I've tried clearing cache/data, and reinstalling the app, giving the app full permissions before first launch, but it still force closes. logcat_and_device_info.zip

			<description>
		Hi This is just a suggestion. I downloaded QKSMS, and after I set it as my default messaging app, it automatically sent out a bunch of failed texts from conversations I had backed up. I saw some old conversation threads move up to the top. Some of them were from a few years ago, and ones which I did not want sent out (like to a couple of exes, which I didnt even realize I still had). Already dealing with the fallout from this. I don't know how common this problem is, but there should maybe be a default setting to not send out unsent or failed texts without clicking on retry. Thanks for considering any suggestions

			<description>
		I ran a backup of messages through Titanium Backup, then restored. In the main screen showing a list of conversations, each conversations had a timestamp of the restoration time, rather than the time of the last message in the conversation, which is the typical behavior in QKSMS. The native Android Messaging app correctly shows the time of the last message as the time of the conversation after restoring. Both native TB backup/restore and xml backup/restore produced this issue.

		I am using version 2.7.3 on both my real device with Android 7.1.1 and on my Android Virtual Devices. When I change the orientation, i.e. rotating my device, multiple times I notice multiple instances of ComposeActivity in the heap memory and a growth of the heap memory usage. I noticed that it occasionally leads to an OutOfMemory error. If you cannot reproduce the failure, I could attach you the memory dump.

		Bug Description After adding a contact or changing their name it does not refresh/update in QKSMS, even after a force stop. This means that if someone texts you for the first time and you add them to your contacts, you are stuck seeing their phone number instead of their name. Behavior is the same for both SMS and MMS messages. Device Details Device: ONEPLUS A3000 Operating System: OxygenOS 5.0.1 (Android 8.0.0 Oreo) QKSMS Version: 3.0 Beta 2 Oneplus Contacts Version 2.1.0.171211210621.bc6c399

			<label>Bug</label>
			<description>
		When a phone number is present inside a sent message, QKSMS looks up any existing contacts for that number. If found, the contact name is shown, but it seems the country code is also removed. e.g. It seems that this change is only done on display, the original number is being sent. However, changing how an outgoing message is sent is actually confusing. If it would just add the contact name, that would probably be ok, but now it actually changes the number. It seems that this happens also for foreign numbers, not just for the local country code (I'm in +31, the example above removes +41). This happens both on incoming and outgoing messages.

		When I try to use Samsung smart capture for a screenshot and try to share it directly to qksms it either fails to put the image into qksms or it crashes the app. If I further attempted to attsch the image without having reopened the app it took multiple tries to get it to attach and then the app crashed after it was sent. üëç 1

		(Hey moezbhatti, long time no chat!) I'm running on Android 7.0 on an LG G5. Upon attempting to send an MMS message, QKSMS3 crashes. I've also noticed that I haven't received any MMS messages until I restore QKSMS 2.7.3 (or other sms app), and see the messages. They do not show up new, as they are in the message database. Here's an adb logcat of QKSMS from start, creating a new message, attaching an image, and (attempting) sending a message. https://gist.github.com/MyNameIsCosmo/4f2e515a372b456bce8d6f5cd2d66c85 EDIT: This happens on beta 5, 4, and 3 as I've tested.

		DESCRIPTION When you input data into the edit text field and then you decide to go back to parent view, you click on back arrow inside the toolbar (top right corner). However, the child to parent redirection animation is faster then the hide keyboard animation, therefore you have this behavior: As you can see even when the parent view is already displayed the keyboard is still visible for less than a second. STEPS TO REPRODUCE Open conversation view Tap search icon Tap the edit text field (if keyboard is not visible) Click the back arrow to go back to the previous view NOTE I have also observed this behavior in other views that have child-parent redirection, so i think it would be nice to deal with this issue to have better animation and user experience. I have an idea how to fix this, so i would also like to claim this issue. Will provide you with a pull request soon.

		If I do not make it back in time for lunch, please practice pipetting. I will also send you a list of problems for the dilution formula. Do not stress if you do not get it, as I have had to delay the study guide in order to figure out normality. 

The formula is as follows:
C1 ‚Ä¢ V1 = C2 ‚Ä¢ V2

Where:
C1 stands for the molar concentration of the first solution
V1 stands for the volume, in the unit liters, of the first solution
C2 is the concentration of the diluted solution 
V2 stands for the volume of the diluted solution

 This fails to copy in qksms V3 B7 but copies without a problem in the default Messenger.

		Using the latest QKSMS3 Beta 8. I received a message, read it, and any message afterwards would display as the &quot;first&quot; message in my notifications. This did not happen I'm beta 7. I won't be by a computer for the next day or so, so I cannot debug the issue fully. EX: Received message: &quot;First Message&quot; Notification: &quot;First Message&quot; Respond to message Receive another message: &quot;Second Message&quot; Notification: &quot;First Message&quot; It may also be worth noting that notifications are displayed even though qksms is open in the same chat the message was received.

		This is using version 3.03 though the same problems exist with the version at the play store. Messages are not being marked as read. I get notifications, then go to the page and read the message but they are still not marked as read. I use another app called professional reminder. If I send a text to myself, and read it in qksms it still shows Quick Stop (C:0 S:1 M:0) Stop all current reminders C,S,M mean phone Calls, Sms, and Mms. I have the reminder set for every 20 minutes so it is beeping every 20 minutes which is very annoying. I don't know if this is relevant but I have QK reply turned off since I don't like it.

		DESCRIPTION Archived messages return to the inbox if QKSMS is not the default application. STEPS Install QKSMS. Launch application, skip making QKSMS the default SMS application. Wait until database is optimized (I had to restart the application a few times for it to complete). Archive some conversations. Exit (via back button) and reopen the application, skip the prompt making QKSMS the default again. Alternate steps where QKSMS is already used as the default: Archive some conversations, if not already. Install / set another application as the default for SMS and exit. Reopen QKSMS, skip making it the default application. EXPECTED Previously archived conversations should remain archived, but instead they are all visible in the inbox list and the archived list remains empty. Tested on current latest F-Droid build, 3.1.1. Not ready to make it my daily driver for SMS just yet, but glad to hear it's back in development!

My Device: Alcatel Fierce 4 5056N , Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow STEPS Go to settings. Enable/Disable night mode. Accept the error message. Open qksms again. EXPECTED Should change the theme to night mode and let the user keep using the app. OBSERVATIONS The app crash at enabling/disabling the night mode, but successfully change the colours. Spanish Korean English (Works properly) This is my first issue report on github so if the issue is not detailed enough or i skip something, sorry!

		DESCRIPTION QKSMS crashes on startup. First reported by Daniel Reardon on Google Communities, here, confirmed by at least one other. Around that time other Google Communities posters were reporting issues with posts not being seen by all users, which is why there may have been no response. STEPS 1 Fire up QKSMS EXPECTED QKSMS starts and works normally. OBSERVATIONS A blank window opens, then vanishes. A system message appears &quot;Unfortunately, QKSMS has stopped.&quot; I've used the &quot;Send feedback&quot; option on the system message twice. I have no idea if it goes to the developer or Google or is silently discarded, but there are no signs it is being dealt with. Android 7.1.2, QKSMS 3,2,2 (from App info, not from the app itself, because the app doesn't start).

		DESCRIPTION When using the light theme, the navigation bar icons on my Huawei Nova 2i (Mate 10 Lite) running 8.0 Oreo become invisible. I've switched back to the default EMUI Explorer theme and uninstalled Navbar Apps, thinking one of them was the cause of the bug. Still the same thing. No problem with the dark mode, however. I'm using the latest v3.3.0, but I also noticed this on v3.2.2. STEPS Open QKSMS Disable dark mode (if it's on) EXPECTED The nav bar icons should be visible at all times. OBSERVATIONS The nav bar icons are invisible and the nav bar itself is black.

OBSERVATIONS the message is automatically marked as read, but there is still a badge number '1' on QKSMS icon. ###Auto-sync feature I used AOSP Messaging app in the past, it will automatically sync messages in background once it is launched. I wonder if you'd like to add this feature to QKSMS. üëç 1
