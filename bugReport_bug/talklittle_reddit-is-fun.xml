			<description>
		A number of users have been reporting force closes when using CyanogenMod and apps2sd, usually when returning to the Activity from another activity (viewing a link in browser then returning) Unfortunately I don't use cyanogen or apps2sd and can't reproduce the bug. Would anyone mind checking this out please? :) I wonder if running TaskKiller to free up some memory would help? EDIT: Ok, I'm going to try switchrom.sh (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=4209412) and debug it myself... EDIT2: Got cyanogen installed, with its automatic apps2sd stuff. I have now indeed encountered force closes that I didn't encounter with stock rom. They mostly happen when rotating the screen. Happened again when rotating screen with login dialog onscreen. Also I get a weird bug where it doesn't load the threads list correctly the first time, and I have to refresh to get anything to show up.

		&quot;&quot;&quot;Hello I've been using your app on my htc magic for a while and have recently upgraded to android 1.6. Since then I have been having problems with increased battery consumption which according to my the battery use monitor is caused by the browser app. The strange thing is that it can occur even when the browser isn't active. I have investigated the problem and discovered that it is connected to 'Reddit is fun'. I can reproduce it by first starting the browser app, starting RIF, opening a link in RIF which opens in a new browser window, then closing the link with the Back key. This causes the browser app running in the background to use a steady 10 - 15% of the CPU which really sucks the juice out of my battery. It only occurs when the browser is already running in the background prior to opening the link in RIF. I am running the custom donut rom from Amon-RA and this could well be the source of the bug. If you should have a chance to try it out on another donut build, I would be most grateful to hear the result.&quot;&quot;&quot;

		Hi, Love the app, but it needs some caching or something. Returning from a link or comments reloads the first page of results instead of the page I was on. Also rotating the screen reloads the first page when I was viewing one further in. Keep up the good work!

		Hello, I really enjoy this application, but I noticed an error with the way some posts are rendered. Check out this post: http://reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/a7wmz/heres_a_picture_of_me_in_my_studio_anyone_else/ When viewed from within 'reddit is fun', many posts with links are truncated in strange places -- notably, one by user locutor and one by user robhutten. I've only just now noticed this phenomenon, but I can recall many other instances where people had links in their posts and referred to something like &quot;the third link&quot;, which only confused me. Any thoughts? Thanks for writing this app, by the way -- it's a real lifesaver. The m.reddit.com site was my previous way to check reddit on the go.

		Oops I broke show more comments.

			<description>
		I have an issue with the app. Whenever I visit a link then press the back button from the browser, I end up on my home screen. I used Taskiller to verify that the process is no longer running after I open the browser, but before I hit the back button. This started happening a week or two ago. I'm not sure if it happened after an upgrade of the app. I'm running Cyanogenmod 4.2.9.1 I have very few other processes running, and 28MB of RAM free before running Reddit is Fun. I have a G1. I did some more testing. After a reboot the app worked fine. But then the problem came back again later in the day. I'm running Reddit is Fun (RIF), and then I open Taskiller from the persistent notification. I only ran Taskiller, and via the notification, because I wanted to launch another processes without having to go back to the home screen, or click anything in RIF. Just so I could see what happened in this case. RIF is crashing as soon as another activity begins. Apparently from an &quot;Activity pause timeout&quot;. I took a look at the Android log and this is what I found. 01-07 14:15:56.590 W/ActivityManager( 141): startActivity called from non-Activity context; forcing Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK for: Intent { cmp=com.tni.TasKiller/.TasKiller } 01-07 14:15:57.140 W/ActivityManager( 141): Activity pause timeout for HistoryRecord{43d26f20 com.andrewshu.android.reddit/.RedditIsFun} 01-07 14:15:57.400 W/Resources( 2097): Converting to string: TypedValue{t=0x12/d=0x0 a=2 r=0x7f060004} 01-07 14:15:57.630 D/dalvikvm( 2097): GC freed 8826 objects / 489992 bytes in 153ms 01-07 14:15:57.740 I/ActivityManager( 141): Process com.andrewshu.android.reddit (pid 2188) has died. 01-07 14:15:57.740 I/ActivityManager( 141): Low Memory: No more background processes. 01-07 14:15:57.740 I/WindowManager( 141): WIN DEATH: Window{43c2dd80 com.andrewshu.android.reddit/com.andrewshu.android.reddit.RedditIsFun paused=false} 01-07 14:15:58.340 W/InputManagerService( 141): Got RemoteException sending setActive(false) notification to pid 2188 uid 10053 01-07 14:15:58.420 I/ActivityManager( 141): Displayed activity com.tni.TasKiller/.TasKiller: 1281 ms (total 1281 ms)

		It's handy not having all messages suddenly marked as read on the desktop, that way you know what you have and have not reviewed yet. If the setting is not selected then reddit is fun will not mark messages that you check as read, resulting in multiple notifications for the same message until you mark them as read in a browser.

It is quite easy to reproduce by just scrolling up and down the article list and watching the thumbnail change A lot of thumbnails don't load. They just show the loading icon for a long time. This happens even with no scrolling on a fast WiFi connection. I have observed this behaviour since thumbnails were first added.

		I can go to comments of items on the start reddit and follow links, etc. If I go to the comments of an item, I can pick go to subreddit and it will take me to the subreddit no problem. If, however, I hit Menu -&gt; Pick Subreddit -&gt; type or select a subreddit, it takes me back to the previous screen. Tried uninstall and reinstall of the Reddit is Fun app to no avail. Done using a Sprint CDMA Hero running Fresh ROM 2.4.

		Finally figured out why. It's because of the load-on-demand feature for the comments. When jumping to comment, the list item sizes are reported as 0 or something very small. Only after loading the comment do they report the correct size. I can think of two solutions right now: load comments one at a time in order, not in getView(). jumpToComment() piggybacks, or at least waits until the desired comment has been loaded by that thread, before jumping to it. jumpToComment() fires repeatedly every 100-200ms until scrolling stops. Disadvantages are different load speed on different devices, and possibly user trying to scroll simultaneously.

		CommentsListActivity takes thousands of milliseconds to display comments sometimes. Doing traces with DDMS hints that the download, parsing and the post-processing is happening serially which could be hurting responsiveness. We should find a way to parse the comment JSON as it arrives. (This may have object reuse benefits as well.

		Since the 1.2.0 update, a bug fix has caused a comment loading regression. It is possible to watch the comments physically flow down the screen as if in slow motion, and the page loading icon continues to circle for up to several minutes. 1.1.4 definitely did not have this problem. This is on an Android Eris running Gingerbread 2.3.5 after a reboot and Dalvik cache reset, though after reading a few app reviews, this is probably a problem in the app for all phones.

		Hi there, it seems the last update has some kind of regression. With version 1.2.1.3 rif had suddenly a lot smoother scrolling. Many users confirmed this. Sadly with the latest update (version 1.2.1.5) it went in the wrong direction again. Scrolling is laggy and slow now, no matter what settings i use. It is definitely a problem with the latest version because changing back to an old version fixes the issue. Thx

However, Reddit is Fun never notified me that I was logged out, only said that this action cannot be completed at this time. Reddit is Fun should detect the invalid user error (I'm not sure what exact error it is right now) and prompt the user to log in, or at least notify the user that their session is no longer valid.
