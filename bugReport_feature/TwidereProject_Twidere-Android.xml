			<description>
		Hello, twitter official client replaced the mentions tab with a notifications tab which also lets the user know if one of their tweets have been favourited, or someone has retweeted a tweet in which they are mentioned etc... is it possible to bring this functionality to twidere? üëç 2

		In the official Twitter app there is a way to star users such that you get push notifications every time they post a new tweet. Would it be possible to add this to Twidere?

			<description>
		When composing a tweet, the account(s) to tweet from are preserved from the last time the window was opened. In the case of tabs that are for specific accounts, I think it would be incredibly convenient option to have where the account set to that of the current tab. Also, I think it might be worth while to add an option to disable the ability to tweet from multiple accounts at any given time.

		In GNU social there are groups which are written with a bangtag, for example there is a Twidere group which would be written (and displayed) like !twidere. At the moment these bangtags are not highlighted in any way. Since I think this could be a bit more work it is up to you to decide if you want to implement it. Maybe it is possible to at least detect the groups and figure out their URL to open it in the browser? #296

		Twidere seems to allow you to copy the text of a tweet, but not just the URL by itself. If I go to the Share option, it will share the URL but it will copy the text of the tweet along with the URL. I want a way to copy ONLY the URL. In Twitter's official mobile app you can simply select &quot;Copy link to tweet&quot; and it does that just fine. Is there no way to do that in Twidere, or am I simply overlooking it? I love Twidere, but this is an option I've really been missing.

		As the title says, I'd like to suggest switching to Android's built-in account sync instead of a constant background process. My device is a low-end phone w/ 1GB RAM, so even a few background tasks tends to make it slow down pretty quickly. AndStatus uses Android's built-in sync, but Twidere has so many more features (plus I like Twidere's UI better).

		Klicking on the three dots opens options for every tweet. You can add filters right there, which is great. But this could be even better: It would help if you could also mute someone right there without having to open their profile (this would save 2-3 clicks). Same goes with disallowing the person's retweets.

		Title pretty much says it. The ability to pin a tweet isn't available on Twitter's mobile website. (I can't speak for their official app because I don't use it. It's as slow as their mobile site but worse, since it's an app, it slows my device down due to how Android works internally and my device's 1GB RAM constraints.) I have to switch to their monstrously-slow desktop site in order to pin a tweet to my profile. This functionality would be greatly appreciated here.

		v.2.0.0 introduced the ability to add alt text to media on Mastodon. Even though there is already a way to do this on Twitter accounts with Twidere, it doesn't seem to be compatible with Mastodon. This is an important feature regarding accessibility. v2.0.0 was published 9 days ago and the last update for Twidere was released on October 11, my guess it isn't implemented yet since I posted this toot from Twidere for Android and the alt text is lacking.
