			<description>
		From facebook: George Markusic I would like to say that I am so happy that someone picked up the support of this application. The only issue I have since the change is my signature. Now when I try to log cache it automatically loads my signature first. I always enjoy putting in a story of my adventure first then add my signature to the bottom. Is it possible to add a feature in a future release where it is an option to have the signature automatically load or you can add it when you want like in the older version. I'll add this functionality.

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		When a user goes through the new field now export feature in cgeo in order to upload her or his logs there is an important difference to the existing online log function. In the latter case, cgeo automatically clears a saved log after it has been commuted to gc.com. In the case of export there is no automatic clearing. In consequence, cgeo will reexport old log entries with the next export. While gc.com will sort old entries based on date, the export files will grow as will the internal database. I would like to suggest that the user can clear saved logs from the history or the stored lists. But maybe someone other has a better idea?

		Please add option for creating an empty cache to the offline database. This way a not c:geo downloaded cache could be managed by c:geo - like waypoint navigation etc For me this use case occurs from time to time: No network access for mobile thus no offline download possible, but hotel lobby provides inet with printing - thus paper-caching ... Non-geocaching.com listed caches - either from opencaching or (like in Konstanz/Germany) tourism caches. The workaround is to edit any other cache and remember which one it was ;-) Bad Idea if I decided to clean the offlined caches before starting trip to new region.... Comments? Best regards - Henning

		Okay, no one else came up with this so far: gc.com sends pocket queries as zip files. Some other woops, such as Locus and GeOrg already directly import zipped gpx files. They register appropriate intents, so importing pocket queries is just a matter of taping on the attachment in your mail client or tapping on the download link on the pocket queries page on gc.com. It would simplify usability quite a lot if c:geo would also support direct import of zip files with gpx data.

			<description>
		When the user drags the map, the position tracking remains on. This leads to confusion as the user drags the map, and then it jumps back to centre on the current position. This happens both with Google Maps and OpenStreetMaps. I think that c:geo's maps should follow the standard set by the Android Maps app, which is to disable tracking as soon as the user starts dragging the map. In a related note, I also feel that it would be nice if c:geo followed the Google Maps approach of putting the &quot;tracking button&quot; on the action bar instead of a floating button on the top corner of the map.

		in Issue #328 @cachapa suggested additionally to move the tracking toggle button to the action bar.

A more descriptive icon than the blue dot would be good, too. @koem: +1 for both! @Bananeweizen: Regarding the button placement: I'm not sure if the action bar is the best place. Currently this seems like a good solution. But I can imagine that we may have some additional controls in the near future (e.g 3 buttons instead of 1), then the action bar might get quite crowded. For instance, there are several applications for tracking your sports races which typically have multiple overlay controls directly on the map. @cachapa: In my view, if there's still space in the action bar, we should put it there. If at one point the action bar becomes crowded, this can be re-evaluated. The platform's UI guidelines should be followed whenever possible, which in this case means following the Google Maps app. In fact, I propose that the icon from Maps be adopted, as it will be the less confusing for new users.

			<description>
		When in other countries, the description mostly isn't in english or your mother language. Normally you cannot go caching then. c:geo should support a translation (e.g. by google translate) which will then be displayed instead of the original texts. After cache refreshing the original texts can be displayed again. Design like this: Choose to translate from menu - all texts will be translated, stored and shown. A progressbar is shown: &quot;translating title, translating short description, translating long description, translating log entry 1/12, ...&quot; Workaround could be #128 - copy text, go to google translate

			<description>
		Static maps can be very valuable, when caching abroad (as data roaming is too expensive to be used). But the static maps are not very useful, as long as they do not show my own position. The Windows Mobile caching app &quot;GCzII&quot; has static maps, which show my position (of course allways updated, when I move). IMO c:geo should have this as well.

			<description>
		Bernd Schreck sent me a mail with this ft. request: Hello everyone, while driving in the car (I am using my smartphone in a fixture) in an area with stored caches, the stand-by mode of the device in list-view is quite annoying. This year I used a &quot;holiday caches&quot;-list for our holiday destination area in order to see caches &quot;approaching&quot; on my route. To keep the &quot;holiday caches&quot;-list displayed (meaning to prevent the stand-by mode) on the phone I had to fiddle all the time with my fingers on the display. Improvement proposal for the list-view: ---&gt; Additional option in the list-view to prevent (i.e. enable) stand-by mode. Currently the list-view provides already a menue with &quot;Options&quot; that leads to &quot;Map&quot; and &quot;List&quot;. The new proposed option &quot;Stand-by mode ON&quot; i.e. &quot;Stand-by mode OFF&quot; could be implemented (added) there. Hope you ll like my proposal and implement this characteristic. Regards, Bernd

			<bugID>Issue #508</bugID>
			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		These should maybe be added as separate issues, but I guess they are small and easy, so they can probably be tracked here. a) Logs should be auto-saved (but ofcourse not posted to gc.com) when pressing &quot;back&quot;. One time too many I have written a long log, and accidentally pressed &quot;back&quot; and had to write it all over again. Maybe add a &quot;clear&quot;-button (with prompt) to clear the log field if anyone ever wants to delete everything they have written without having to long press -&gt; select all -&gt; delete. b) Signature should be placed below cursor position. Currently the cursor is placed at the bottom, below the signature, when i start logging which is usually not what at least I expect. c) Logs on cache page does not show all (unicode) characters. I guess this has to do with either the font used, or Android per se, so it might not be an easy fix. You can add a number of unicode-chars to your logs by using the html entities (IE ✐). They show up fine on the web (gc.com), but not on the phone, where they are simply displayed as squares. It would be great if the font used in the app was able to show more of these characters.

Any suggestions how I can determine the image urls because there is no direct connection from the cache data to the images. The image gallery has to be parsed at first.... What about - for a first version - a new menu entry that opens the images in the browser if there are any images associated with the cache ?

		From email: Dear cgeo-developers, since some months we use cgeo with our HTC Desire HD - thanks at this point for you great work!!! Before (and still now) we use a HTC Touch Pro2 under WinMobile 6 and the software &quot;gatecacher&quot; (by Dennis Baremans). This software has one feature that works perfect when approaching a cache (especially by bike): at certain distances (every 50m from 950 to 150m, every 10m from 150m to 50m, every 5m from 50m to 10m and then every meter) they are given by playing these predefined sounds (wav-files) together with the current angle (also as sound). Sounds for distances larger than 950m are not available but from time to time the current angle is spoken. This wonderful feature unfortunately no Andoid-GC-Software consists of as far as I know It would be wonderful if in any future cgeo could get something like this. Yours Uwe

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		As far as I've seen, cache data for offline use is currently either spidered online from the gc website or imported from gpx-files. Have you already thought of importing cache data from the saved html-page of a cache detail site? You would save the cache detail site as html page, put it in the .cgeo folder on the sdcard and let cgeo import it from there without contacting the gc site at all. This way, the gc site would not be spidered with your login data and you do not have to create a pocket query. You just open the cache you like in your browser and use the &quot;Save Page&quot; - &quot;Html only&quot; feature of the browser. Of yourse, this is only practicable if you don't want to import dozens of caches. But for getting the details of a few caches this is a fast and secure method. (I got the cgeo source code and did a proof-of-concept implementation, which works great for me. I did not create a pull request because I possibly have overlooked something in the implementation and because I'm new to the git cvs and the whole project).

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		Just today a strange idea came into my mind and I want to ask you about your opinion and about the general feasibility: Since some weeks you implemented the import of QR-Codes via QR-Droid,etc to scan GC-Codes. When selecting this feature it also allows me to open Google Goggles. This made me think about the following: I tried Goggles to read a Travel Bug Dog Tag and it worked, that it delivered back the TB-code from the tag. Would it be possible to allow scanning of the code and opening the TB-page with it ? Just today I went again to a TB-Hotel with &gt;10 Bugs and most of them without description of the goal. So I had to input each code manually into the c:geo search to look them up. I dont really know if scanning is faster, but if Goggles is working reliable it could save a lot of manual input (and its a really sophisticated feature :) )

		This is a request for frontend improvement: the &quot;navigate any location&quot; activity has a history of past locations entered. However, its use is currently rathing limited. In particular: the user can only delete a history waypoint or navigate using the compass. the user cannot navigate any other method, such as maps, et cetera. A long tap on a waypoint brings up only the option to delete. the user cannot recall a history waypoint. My suggestion is to change the activity as follows: when the user taps on a history waypoint, its coordinates get transferred to the input field. No navigation is done yet. the user then may choose to edit the waypoint or navigate using the same methods as when entering a new waypoint. the existing &quot;shortcut&quot; of tapping on a history waypoint and navigating by compass should be removed as its use conflicts with easy recall, editing, and navigating by other means.

Normally i use my personal, latest build when i am on a cache tour to find bugs... In case of bugs this can be very annoying and i need a fallback to the Market version. I have to deinstall c:geo and download it again from the market.... A parallel installation of the Eclipse (developer) version of c:geo would solve this problem. While developing we could use a different AndroidManifest.xml than for the release build. Your opinions about this ? And: how does Android distinguish two different applications ?

		When I was caching today, I played with the Android sound recorder on the way back home from the cache (to record a &quot;voice log&quot;). I suggest to make that an official integrated feature: Have a new menu item in the visit activity to record audio (which just invokes the native audio recorder). When the audio recorder closes, it returns a content URI for the recording. We would need to save that with the cache (and change the DB for that). Playback of the recording could be invoked from a second menu item in the visit activity or from the history. As the audio stuff is handled by the recorder, we don't need additional permissions. Example code: http://www.openintents.org/en/node/114

Use Case: Sometimes I want to look up the goals of the TB i currently have with me. The only possibilty is to use the search for each TB which means I first have to lookup the tracking code every time. Also in the log view the TBs are ony listed but not linked to the TB-details. On http://www.geocaching.com/my/default.aspx there is a list of the users inventory, which could be used to make a inventory list also in cgeo. This could be a new menuitem in search and there could also be a link from logview to open the listed TBs detail page.

		I just tried out c:geo NB with a basic member account. If I have seen it correctly all the caches on live-map (except the caches stored on the device) will appear with non-reliable marker. I know, that the reliability can only be checked if the user is PM. Assuming that this functionality will go to the market, I guess that many basic-member users will not understand why the caches are marked as unreliable and will probably not like this feature or even don't trust the app anymore. The change to look-and-feel is to drastic. In fact in most cases the caches shown to basic-members will have reliable coordinates anyway, but we just cant detect that right now. I hope, that I understood the the working-mode of the reliable-check, if not please correct me and/or close this issue. After having seen the look-and-feel for basic-members I would like to suggest to think over the display of reliability in the following way: For premium members only mark unreliable by a orange-circle and reliable without marker (like currently implemented) For basic members only mark reliable by a green-circle and unreliable without marker Doing it in this way each type of user would only get notified by a marker in important cases on his user-perspective and not be overwhelmed by a lot of caches marked in some way. What do you think ?

		Imagine there are several similar caches located in a small area. All are saved in a list, but the names are long with a appending number. So they are hard to distinguish. On the map started from the list all look also the same because they are of the same type. Now during the cache tour every cache is logged offline as found (or DNF) and in the list they are marked. But on the map they look still similar. It would be an improvement to &quot;mark&quot; them also on the map. Maybe an overlay or a slightly changed color could do it.

		Now that we have the possibility to translate several fields of a cache, it would also be nice to invoke arbitrary apps with those texts (maybe a different translation app, the mail app, ...). Therefore we should have another menu item in that context menu of text fields similar to the &quot;Send to&quot; menu of the cache itself (using &quot;text/plain&quot; as mime type in this case).

		Currently this new feature is only used for the action bar. For intuitive use it should also be available on long click in the cachedetail menu and maybe also represented by another icon in the background. I like this feature because I use radar and map equally but I almost never use the actionbar to start the activity but the menu.

		Since a while I have a phone with Android 2.3.6 which allows enabling/disabling GPS very easily from the status bar. I now have it disabled by default (so Facebook and other apps can not track my position), but always forget to activate it for c:geo and then wonder why the position is not updated. We really need to have a check in the tool whether or not GPS is enabled (at least when entering the map) and to notify the user or to activate it by ourselfes then. Not sure if there are duplicates for this, I didn't find one with the quick search.

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		A feedback of some friends who are using the nightly builds: I import a lot of gpx-files with quite high amount of caches (sometimes up to 500). The import is OK with the new version but it takes ages because it downloads static-maps which I use only rarely. I would like a setting to switch it off for gpx-import to save time. If I switch off the general setting for static-maps I can also not use them for all other caches and I am also not asked whether I want to download them on access. I think a lot of users will run into this &quot;problem&quot; and in addition the Map-API will give up after 1000 requests (which is easy to reach already with 200 caches also containing some waypoints). Therefore I would suggest to have a separate setting for static map loading while importing a gpx.

			<description>
		Hello, Is possible to implement some option for exporting caches (from Stored) to Locus? I know I can send them to Locus using Menu-Show on map-Locus. But it doesn't save them to Locus' database so it's not possible to use some features for them (such as downloading map around caches or displaying 161 m circles)... I found that if I cachange last parameter in DisplayData.sendData function (AbstractLocusApp.java, line 81) to true, Locus asks for saving caches - that's exactly what I need. So it'll be great if you'd add something like Menu-Show on map-Export to Locus. It wouldn't be that difficult, wouldn't it? Thank you! BTW I asked author of Locus about saving these temporary caches and he replied me it would be very complicated and easiest way is to ask you for implementing this straight to c:geo.

		With the current market release more details when opening a cache popup are only requested if the cache type is unknown. From my point of view it would be an improvement also to request the data if the popup is opened for caches which already have a parsed cache type icon, because: It will deliver the D/T rating and cache size It will deliver the favorite points (but currently this is not used for the popup anyway) We would be able to confirm or correct the cache type (if parsing went wrong) Let's say you are using the live map to look for an appropriate cache to go for, then this information would be very useful and it will probably be faster than having to download every cache.

		Obviously Gps averaging takes many Gps points and averages them to give an accurate fix. People use it to set accurate coordinates when hiding caches. There's an ap If you are a geocacher this should be familiar. You arrive at or near a cache location and your phones Gps is not accurate by as much as 10 to 20 meters. (Especially in trees or canyon effect.) Why not offer a switch on the c:geo compass which you use when near to a cache. Switch averaging on and don't move the phone. The user will get an accurate distance and bearing to the cache. The user could move to the location and re average to home in. In a nut shell you would make c:geo the most accurate search geocache application on the market. I think you should give this consideration. Please can you give me some feed back Regards chris

		If a nearby search is performed by a basic member he will get the distance graphics only (unless he enables the re-captcha) and only basic information of the caches. People are often complaining, that e.g. &quot;sort by distance&quot; is not working in this case because it is still selectable but has no effect although they see the distance on the screen. First of all I thought about disabling the sorting by distance in this case (if technically possible). Same would apply for other sorting options which are not available in this case (e.g. D/T, Size, etc.). But as the distance is one of the most important information in case of a nearby(!) search it would be even better to obtain the distance information somehow. Perhaps it would be feasible to drop the support of distance-graphics and instead implement a new approach ? I once learned, that there is a very small HTML on geocaching.com used for send2gps. If I remember right, it is very small and gives coordinate information for the cache requested.

Reason is most likely, that imperial units are the default on geocaching.com unless the user changes this setting. For PM the setting on the website is not relevant as c:geo calculates automatically according to the setting. I suggest to implement that c:geo changes the preference on the website according to the user setting (as it is already done e.g. for the language setting) to avoid a mismatch.

		Currently there is no possibility to manually download static maps for a certain cache in case the general setting &quot;Download static maps for caches&quot; is switched off in the settings. But switching it on in the settings will also load the static maps generally e.g. in case of GPX-imports. This has some side effects like long import time, google timing issue and restrictions. It should be possible to download static maps manually for a cache (like it is already implemented for the case that no static map is available). After this has been implemented I would further suggest to have the general setting for downloading static maps switched off in order to avoid problems on GPX-imports. My personal guess is, that only a minor percentage of users want to have a static map by default in this case. Another possibility would be to introduce a new setting for &quot;Static map download for GPX-imports&quot; to split up the usecases. This should be switched off by default.

I did notice however that wwhen the compass Screen is opened it goes to landscape view which is awkward to hold a 7 inch tablet in that orientation is it possible to add a way to rotate the compass Screen Sent via Hubroid

		It would be useful if c:geo would support &quot;Ignore Listing&quot;. Some cachers use this features to hide out caches they are not able to do (e.g. T5) from search results. Currently the search already does not show caches which are on the ignore list, it should additionally be possible to add caches to the ignore list.

		Recently more cache information was added to the compass like D/T and cache size as well as the waypoint type, Maybe it would be possible to show the text for the waypoint (the note added to the waypoint) additionally. If you look e.g. at GC3FJ5F the wapoints note includes the question to answer. While caching you navigate to that waypoint and the compass shows &quot;Question to answer&quot; but to see the question I have to go back to the waypoint view to see it. It could be implemented in the line used for the type of waypoint (e.g. &quot;Question to answer:......) or even below the compass as an additional text line above the current coordinates. From my point of view it will be very helpful to know what to do, without the need to go back from compass to other views.

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		Hello, The reason for this issue comes mainly from issue #1602. If you import/store/refresh a large number of caches, you'll hit the google maps api limit for static maps. Issue #1602 covers a fundamental change to handle this situation better. I am thinking of a quick improvement which could help a lot. If we sort the caches before starting the actual refresh/loaddetails thread, we can make sure that after a while all caches are refreshed (and have static maps). My first thought was to order them by the 'property' &quot;hasStaticMaps&quot;. So caches that don't have static maps, will be first in the list and get refreshed first. After that I thought maybe a more general solution would be to just order the caches by &quot;lastUpdated&quot; timestamp. So the ones that have the oldest stored data, get refreshed first. This would cover my use-case, but also kinda makes sense in a general way. Let me know what you think, I think making a patch would not be too difficult. Once I have the dev environment up and running that is.

		Hello, I was wondering whether we could use the OSM map files used by navfree. Usecase: I have Navfree app installed on my phone. It offers trun by turn navigation using offline maps. It uses OSM maps. So I have the benelux and france maps downloaded on my device (for my holiday). This is about 1.5G of map data. I also have c:geo installed, for I want to use also offline maps. For this I need OSM map files also, whichs means another 1.5G. Question: Could we re-use the OSM map files from navfree? It seems they use a different format, but possible this format is also supported by the mapsforge? The files/folders used in this format look like this (Benelux map): +---map_osm_6.1.0.152

Currently: Notes from gc.com are shown and can be edited A new note can be created On updating the cache details a personal note created in the app is deleted (if empty on website) or overwritten by the personal note from gc.com Desired behaviour (to be discussed): If the personal note on gc.com is empty and local note is existing this note should be uploaded to gc.com. This could be done instantly when creating or (IMHO better) if the cache is updated If personal notes are existing locally and remote there needs to be an alignment in some way (e.g. take the longer one, ask the user, etc.)

		HTC One X / Android 4.0.x Reading my gmail, I see a published cache notification. I click the link in the email - http://coord.info/GC4xxxx. What do you want to complete this action with - cgeo, chrome, etc - I choose cgeo cgeo spins for a while on 'Loading cache details' Error 'cgeo failed to download the cache. Unknown communication error' Same result if I try to load the cache using the GC code in the 'Search' tool. Live map with 'live' enabled also doesn't display the cache. Hmmm. I'm going to struggle to FTF this one if cgeo won't load it. I add a waypoint manually and hop in the car. I got it ten minutes after publication. Job done ;-) Now I'm trying again back at the office later on to see why I couldn't download it. This is on wi-fi with manual proxy settings. My proxy server logs show no connection attempts being made by my android. It's like cgeo isn't going through the proxy properly. Normal browser pages load fine in chrome or in other browsers on my android. My gmail loads fine over the wifi. But cgeo? Nope. I'm about 85% sure this used to work on the office wifi with the proxy, but I could be wrong. Either way, it ought to work fine through a proxy. I have full access to the company proxy server, so I know what is/isn't being blocked at the proxy level; I can see no evidence of cgeo even connecting to the proxy. Is cgeo using the wifi proxy settings properly?

		Hi all, I have an idea, as it is now obsolete to have dashboard (according to current google's recomendations) and as I use app, I discovered, that I often only skip dashboard to list of caches or active map (I don't use other options very often). I have done small test ... I added intent filter for launcher to several activities ... and it seems to be usable at least for offline list (minor change needed .. default value of type value is null ... changed to OFFLINE)and google maps activity, other map activities crash when started directly, but this could be fixed. What is your opinion on this ? If we are not dependent on going though dashboard ... we can speedup app a lot and make it much more usable. For lists it will be possible to create direct shortcuts to particular lists (the same as you can obviously create shortcuts to particular folder on SD card).

		Right now, we use an &quot;id&quot; to identify the waypoint, which is the row id in the database. Not only this will not survive a backup/restore which does not copy the database, but also it duplicates information: the prefix and lookup code are both unique for a given geocode. We should use a couple (geocode, prefix) (or (geocode, lookup)) to identify a waypoint uniquely.

		Today I was doing a multi-cache where I got coordinates in DDMMSS-style, e.g. with 23.4''. When entering them in our dialog, the fractional part as '4' it was interpreted as '004', which surprised me (and took a while to notice). Even if I think this interpretation would be well aligned with my expectations regarding fractional minutes (the three digits are so 'standard' to me that I simply do not see them as fraction). I'd rather not prepend trailing zeros for fractional seconds. What do you think?

For example Thailand is not on their list. a) generate (missing) maps with osmosis on a regular basis and link to available downloads on mapsforge b) add links in settings to open cgeo-download pages (and mapsforge) c) in a later stage we could even integrate the download into c:geo Wouldn't it be cool if cgeo.org is the most complete download server for mapsforge maps in the world?

		Idea of a user: Currently on the cache-detail screen the coordinate format can be changed by tapping onto the coordinates. On the waypoint tab however this is not working, but you have to edit the waypoint, use the dropdown selection to change the format and read it from the editor window. It would be a useful addon and an alignment of the user interface if this one click conversion would also work on the waypoint tab. Usecase: For car navigation the car does only accept DMS and you have to first edit the parking waypoint before you can use the coordinates in you car navigation each time.

Currently it updates the voice output every 30 seconds and tells you &quot;11 o'clock, 270 meters&quot;. The voice output probably makes absolutely no sense in other languages than German and English, as it will use your locale for the voice, but the English text (as there are no other translations yet).

			<description>
		Improvement proposal for the speech output function recently integrated by @Bananeweizen : Currently a fixed interval of 30s is implemented. The GCBabble offered a settings for this (which I do not suggest to implement) and also an adaptive speaking (which does not work for me or I do not know how it is supposed to work). After thinking a bit about it my idea would be: Implement an adaptive speaking interval which triggers an output each time the distance to target has decreased or increased by a certain value and only keep the minimum interval at 30 (or 20 ?) seconds in case of no movement (distance does not change or change of distance is below the aforementioned limit). I would propose the following distance steps for that (to be discussed) assuming a walking navigation: 1000m distance: 200m 500-1000m distance: 100m 200-500m distance: 50m 100m-200m distance: 20m 0-100m distance: 10m As the speed output itself takes some time there has to be a lower limit of 5s anyway to avoid triggering the next output while the first is still running.

		May I wish for a new feature? Right now if I chose to display circles on the map, a circle is displayed around each and every feature (finals, waypoints, original coordinates). In a densely populated area the map can get rather crowded and it is hard to see which circle belongs to which object, making it difficult to find a free spot to place a new cache. It would be really cool, if the 161m-circles around caches would only be displayed around physical objects like finals (of traditionals and user-entered final coordinates of multis and mysteries) and stages of multicaches, because only with those physical stages the 161m-rule is important. You might add a new option to display circles around everything or only around physical stages.

		There seem to be some caches (virtual) which require a passkey/keyword in order to place found logs. Example: OCB68A In c:geo I can compose a found log (I did not send it because I did not really visit it), on the website I need the passkey to post a found log. I don't know whether the API supports this and I don't know whether I can post a found log via c:geo even without entering the password.

		From FB: When one exits the map and enter the cachedescription for logging and then enters the map afterwards the trace is gone. Request: Track on map log. Would like a track log that shows the track even if one have closed the map and opened it once again. Just like a track log on a real GPS. Reasson: Have been some places where mapcoverage isn't good and would like the possibilities to &quot;backtrace&quot; ones footsteps. Also when leaving the live map by using the back key the trail is lost. It would be could to keep it running/saved as long as c:geo is active with a menu option on the map menu to clear it.

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		Currently the option &quot;since last export&quot; in the field note upload dialog will only activate the appropriate checkbox on geocaching.com fieldnote page. This has some disadvantages: The checkbox is only existing on the webpage if there are still pending logs (it can be used to add more notes to an already exisiting list of pending notes only). If a user exports field notes from c:geo, logs all the notes on gc.com and later exports again as he has new offline logs, all stored offline logs will be again shown on gc.com (old ones and new ones). We could delete the offline logs in c:geo once the export and upload is OK, but as exporting them does not mean logging them, this might raise other problems. So saving an own timestamp of the last export (not use the gc.com feature) and exporting only logs newer than that sound like a better way.

		By now we explicitly support around 12 different navigation apps and tools (e.g. bike navigation, Oruxmaps and that stuff). While that is really nice for the people who want to invoke exactly their app, I find this menu is starting to get huge (at least on my device). As we now have better settings, it would probably make sense to add another category to the navigation screen, where each navigation app can be disabled using a checkbox. Each would be checked by default, and only for installed apps the preference would be enabled.

		Hi, is there a reason why there is no Firefox AddOn? The idea I have is to remove the need for Greasemonkey, as I find this to be cumbersome for novice users. It would be fairly simple to do this, 5 lines with the AddOn builder and page-mod. Though, one possible issue I see with this is the update mechanism, as for each change of the script the addon would need to be updated as well, but then Firefox would update the app automatically. Furthermore I have one off-topic question, is the server side code for send2cgeo publicly available as well? Looking forward for feedback.

		I've recently switched c:geo to use offline maps, in preparation for a trip to Italy.

For bonus point: revert back to &quot;live&quot; map when no offline one is present (especially when browsing the map) - for instance, I'm set to England right now as I'm at home, but I was scrolling around the live map looking for caches in Italy... but no map appears, making it hard.

		Feature request: I am using c:geo with different Pocket Querys. From time to time it is necessary to replace the hole PQ. There is no other easy way to keep all data up to date. (updating the caches whould not bring new caches in the area and not delete archived caches. And additionaly needs needs much time, data-plan-usage and gc-server-capacity). Like much users I have a list for each PQ. So I have to delete all caches in the list and import a newer PQ for that area. But all self-created waypoints etc. get lost in that moment. I whould like a possibillity to keep all that kind of data. I know it whould waste much phone-storage-place to keep every waypoint of deleted caches from holidays years before. Thats not the best way. But perhaps its possible to delete the data some time later after thethe cachelisting and only if there is not the same cache stored on the phone again in the meantime?? Or a complete different posibillity to replace a PQ?

(22:31:13) Lineflyer: I am not sure if this is just gc.com (after their tile server change)
(22:31:16) Lineflyer: c:geo
(22:31:29) rsudev: gc.com in c:geo?
(22:31:33) Lineflyer: yes
(22:31:58) Lineflyer: Now something really weired out of my mind
(22:32:29) Lineflyer: In the logs is see &quot;Cache XY loaded from DB&quot; or &quot;Cache xy returned no results&quot; for each and every cache parsed from live map
(22:32:59) Lineflyer: I am really not sure if this was the procedure ever since or came in new
(22:33:09) Lineflyer: COuld this slow done the whole process?
(22:33:31) Lineflyer: I see some 0,2-0,5 seconds or sometimes even more between those consecutive requests
(22:33:55) Lineflyer: Are these DB requests?
(22:34:04) Lineflyer: DB is slow,...isnt it?
(22:34:04) rsudev: These are DB requests
(22:34:10) rsudev: they are slow
(22:34:29) rsudev: We need them to get coords and found state of stored caches (and type and...)
(22:34:40) Lineflyer: Was it always like that? Or maybe due to changes in merging data?
(22:34:50) rsudev: they could be fater if bundled
(22:35:02) Lineflyer: fater :D
(22:35:05) Lineflyer: ;)
(22:35:07) rsudev: That I am not sure of - I copuld try to research this
(22:35:16) rsudev: fater faster :)
(22:35:55) Lineflyer: cachecache = DB  Right?
(22:36:00) rsudev: no
(22:36:15) rsudev: cachecache helps avoiding db
(22:36:46) Lineflyer: isnt cachecache just for unsaved caches
(22:37:40) Lineflyer: saved with listid=0
(22:37:47) Lineflyer: in DB
(22:37:48) Lineflyer: ?
(22:38:14) rsudev: No. Its for all. Its the only place where we hold livemap caches, but all detailed ones are in the db and in the cachecache if needed
(22:38:25) Lineflyer: mmh
(22:39:24) Lineflyer: couldnt we load all saved caches to cachecache when starting cgeo or livemap ?  (Again: Just brainstorming wiithout any deep knowledge)
(22:40:03) Lineflyer: Sadly the c:geo version of just after introduction of cachecache is no longer working
(22:40:20) Lineflyer: I remember an impressive performance boost  at that time
(22:40:34) rsudev: We can't generally, as even the big phones do not have enough memory for that
(22:40:40) Lineflyer: ok
(22:41:45) Lineflyer: I would really love to have a flow chart of how that live map merging works to analyze and improve...but this will not be easy
(22:41:46) rsudev: We can try to bulk load caches in the live-map area (we do that anyway, hmmm)
(22:42:13) rsudev: Perhaps these additional requests are just not needed
(22:42:58) Lineflyer: As said...It is just my brain telling me that those hundreds of &quot;Cache xy retuned no results&quot; was not present in the past (months ago)
(22:44:13) rsudev: those should be relatively fast, I assume
(22:44:51) Lineflyer: not really...afair...  some weeks ago I posted this somewhere that I see a maximum of 2-3 lines per second in the log

		Always returning the twenty first results from opencaching seems to be not a good idea, as you may be far off the mainland of a particular site and thus receive a number of meaningless results (several thousand kilometers away).

		My device and my c:geo are usually in French. I do not have the &quot;Translate to English&quot; menu because it is only offered when c:geo is configured to use English. Given the fact that the most used translator, Google Translate, uses English as a pivot language and may be very bad for other languages, I propose to always offer the &quot;Translate to English&quot; menu in addition to the local language. This has hit me in Prague where the French translation for some cache was awful.

		I propose to make a more sensible default for the type of a waypoint when creating a new one, depending on the type of cache: Traditional: Keep Reference point Mystery: Make „Final“ default Multi: Make „Stage of Multi“ default (or whatever the english translation is in the moment) — yes i know that then at the end you have to change to „Final“. But normally Multis have more than one stage, but only one final. Others: Don't know, perhaps you guys have ideas? Else keep „Reference Point“. I personally never need a „reference point“, and so i have to constantly change the type of waypoint when i need one. Just a small thing, but it would mean less annoyance. Thanks for considering.

Perhaps this can be implemented in addition to the other two options? I suspect c:geo has to scan the DCIM-directory itself and cannot rely on delegating the task to the gallery app for that feature. Or is there an matching intent? Bonuspoints when it takes the second-to-last picture when i already uploaded the last one (when i want to upload two pictures to the same log). Thanks for considering.

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		A discussion on facebook brought up this proposal: Do not open the map on the current position by default, but on the last remembered map position (which is not the last remembered device position!). Because people sometimes switch between map and lists (or settings, or...) and then have difficulties finding the previous (non center) location again. As a lot of people would expect the map to open at the current position normally, this somehow needs to be tied to a &quot;session&quot;. Such that if you use c:geo on Monday, it does not reopen at the old position on Tuesday, but on the current position. As Android does not really support this &quot;session&quot; concept well, I suggest to use the time delta as criteria. If the map is opened again in a time span of 1 hour, reopen the map at the last position, otherwise at the current position.

		From @YraFyra: The current implementation is first looking at the Alias field. If no match is found then DisplayName is searched. However, this search is done using the '=' thus only matching full names. I suggest to using &quot;LIKE&quot; as operator and &quot;%GcAlias%&quot; as pattern to really find the best candidates. Of course this may return more that one match and therefore I added a simple optionsmenu to select which contact to open. and let me add to this: I use to store most caching contacts in this format: Max TheCacher Mustermann or just Max TheCacher where the geocaching name (TheCacher) is either the middle name or the last name. I think some users might do alike, so I would prefer if these formats are also matched (I dont't know if this is implicit in the proposal above).

I've been trying to remove this using a ReaderFilter as described in http://info.tsachev.org/2009/05/skipping-invalid-xml-character-with.html, but that implementation only works for invalid characters as such, not for invalid character references. Now we could implement our own character reference detection, in a FilterReader, but to me that looks like a very big gun. Does anyone see an easier solution? Just to be crystal clear: I know this is a bug on the GC.com side, but nevertheless I would like to fix it in our app.

		Today I wanted to copy waypoint coords from c:geo to the clipboard in order to use them for calculation in another app. It seems not to be easily possible to do that; you can actually copy either latitude or longitude (if format &quot;plain&quot; is selected) to the clipboard but not the whole string like it is supported for the cache coordinates itself (long click on coords). For pasting coords from clipboard into a new waypoint there is a similar &quot;problem&quot;. If you paste them into the latitude field of course the complete string (with lat and lon) is pasted in one field which is wrong. Here some more intelligence is needed or it would need an option like &quot;Create wapoint with clipboard content&quot;

		I know, that this is not the main purpose of a geocaching app, but this request is made really often via support mail, so I would like to place it here and not simply deny a function a lot of users want to have: Have an option on the compass screen to turn on/off the camera-LED of my smartphone (e.g. a graphical button on the compass screen) I also link those users to apps supporting this via the notification screen or some key-shortcut, but I have to admit that this is probably some usage steps more than just clicking on the screen in your geocaching app. I assume there is some free code for this, so it would IMHO require just a button triggering that function?!

		This one is difficult to describe: I am very sure, that in the past it was possible to open an OC-cache and have an inventory page shown with the listed geokrets. It was also possible to click on the inventory and see the details of the geokret. Today with 2014.06.03-NB I have seen that this is obviously no longer working. I continued and tested it with the last market release 2014.05.14, but even there it seems not to work anymore. I am unsure whether it stopped working some time before that, or it is a problem of the API or it is a problem of switching to the new API. @rsudev Possibly you are the right one to answer that. Example: OCB92E which has a virtual geokret always logged into that cache

Just displaying the number of received bytes there would really help to understand what is going on. Bonus points for getting the overall number of to be transferred bytes from the HTTP header and showing a percentage.

I checked the website and have seen the following new(?) date formats: dd.MMM.yyyy dd.mm.yyyy Seems gc.com introduced '.' as separator as well. At least four users gave feedback, that they were actually using one of these but did not actively change to that. So might be, that they changed some defaults based on whatever rule. Shall we do anything for that? dd.MMM.yyyy should be detectable and usable, but dd.mm.yyyy is not usable I think (due to the existing mm.dd.yyyy)

		Recently we disabled Samsung multi window support as there seems to be a memory leak in some versions of Samsungs multi window feature leading to crashes when continously rotating the device while c:geo live map with mapsforge offline map is active. There was a discussion in Munich whether or not we should reenable this feature. I vote for reanabling because: It would be a feature regression if we release without that function. I know some people regularly using it (e.g. gallery and c:geo in multi window for typing in coords from pictures they took) Only a subset of devices seem to be affected (my S3 (Android 4.3) is affected, my Samsung S4 (Android 4.4.2) and my Galaxy Note 10.1 (Android 4.3) are not affected) The OOM seems only to happen when using mapsforge in combination with continous rotation (in combination with an affected device). It could be a rare case anyway. Opinions? I will meanwhile test if other apps supporting it have similar problems on my S3 (e.g. Locus).

		After 3ff011f has been implemented (very nice feature btw) I recognized an case at this weekend: GC27W1Y It is a multi with a predefined WP for stage 1 named Station 1 (as stage 1 is always at the listing coords but sometimes separately listed by the owner) After solving stage 1 I entered a new WP and it was autonamed Stage of a multi cache 1 but should be Stage of a multi cache 2 This is probably hard to solve automatically as the initial waypoint can have random names. I renamed the new WP Stage of a multi cache 1 manually to Stage of a multi cache 2 and saved it Afterwards I again created a new WP to enter the coords of the third stage. Now the autofill gives me 'Stage of a multi cache 1' again although Stage of a multi cache 2 already exists. Here we should not only look up whether Stage of a multi cache 1 is existing but also if other Stage of a multi cache x are existing and create Stage of a multi cache (x+1) in this case.

		When Google geocoder (used to transform addresses into coordinates) fails or is not installed in the phone, we resort to geocaching.com simple geocoder which returns one set of coordinates and return the caches from geocaching.com located near those coordinates. As a consequence, caches from other connectors are not fetched. When the geocaching.com connector is active, we should use its geocoder as a fallback for Google geocoder instead of a special case for loading geocaching.com caches. Also, some other geocaching sites may provide their own geocoders.

		There should be a way to vote from the cache details screen, without the need to use the logging activity. It should encourage users to vote more often. E.g. we could always display the row with the own rating (instead of only when he/she already voted), and ask the user for his vote on tapping that row.

			<summary>Favor cgeo over other ways to handle cache URIs transmitted via NFC</summary>

			<bugID>Issue #4590</bugID>
			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		When cgeo is used to beam a cache to another device, we do not explicitly request that cgeo is open if present. One one of my devices, this leads to a browser being opened instead of cgeo, because I once opted out for Firefox instead of cgeo on this tablet. However, here the intention is clear: beaming from cgeo should favor opening cgeo on the remote device. We need to add an AAR (Android Application Record) to the Ndef message. I propose to include one commit (57c41e9) as soon as possible in the release, as it will not change the behavior but will ensure that explicit requests to use cgeo will be handled properly. The second commit (525d94c) will then be added to the master branch only. While this way of doing is not strictly necessary, that would allow people with version N-1 of cgeo to receive explicit beams sent by version N as well. Thoughts?

		I have written a URL for a trackable to an NFC tag but when I scan it I only get the option to open it in one of my two browsers. If I click the same link in for example an email I get the option to also open it in c:geo. As I understand this is because Android doesn't detect c:geo as capable of opening NFC url:s. I also tried writing the URL for a geocache to a NFC tag with the same result, I only get to chose one of my two browser for opening it when scanned. (I would be really neat to have this feature since the NFC tag in question is implanted in my hand and I want people to be able to log it easily with c:geo when scanning it) I found something related to this issue here: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/84173/how-to-set-default-browser-used-by-nfc

		When opening a map, it gets an initial title which does not change afterwards. But several options menus make the map behave totally different.

This is most confusing when the map was started from a list, where it (correctly) takes the list title initiallly.

Advantage for the user: Have only one small file valid for his Garmin and c:geo (which is in fact the same device=Monterra).

		It would be cool if c:geo could import comments from GCComment. Since I am not a Premium Member at Groundspeak anymore, it has become indispensable for me. But I always missed the the sync of them to c:geo. GCComment GCComment is browser extension for managing your personal cache notes for basic and premium members (option to sync them with GS's personal notes). It also advantages compared to GS's personal notes: no char limit, additional coords, ... I'm not initiator of the script, but I try to fix bugs and keep the development going. In my branch I've created a version with the possibility to share comments as links (gist based). This version is not ready for release yet (some little thing are missing), but it's working. The gist export could be basis for an import in c:geo. Links There are 3 types of links: single cache: http://gcc.lukeiam.de#gcc77f77058034820de51e1 (id starts with gcc and is 23 chars long) If you cut of the gcc from the id you get the gist id where the data is stored: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/77f77058034820de51e1 multiple caches: http://gcc.lukeIam.de#gccce2836e0154de67363c1f (id starts with gccc and is 24 chars long) Cut of the gccc from the id you get the gist id again: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e2836e0154de67363c1f static link to multiple caches: All other links change with each export, but the static links can be resolved to the last multiple caches export of the user. (If the user agreed with uploading his ids - It uses a little web service hosted on azure) http://gccs.lukeIam.de#23788787-7b74-459b-96b3-3773eca8f5a6 (other subdomain and id contains - and is 36 chars long) Use this id and call https://idresolver.azurewebsites.net/23788787-7b74-459b-96b3-3773eca8f5a6 and you will get a multiple caches id: &quot;gccce2836e0154de67363c1f&quot; Data The data is encoded in xml and can be parsed easily. See the links above for examples. Gist API Gist has an easy to use REST-API to download the data: https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/ c:geo integration It would be cool to support two methods: Import with qr code by url (using intent-filter?) Save the static url in the options and import frequently or on request I could write some java code to help, but I'm quite new to android.

		I did not see this filter in an offline list : considering and filtering caches with zero found log (as possible FTF to do). Of course, this is the cache state according to the last refresh, but it's user responsibility to update it. I know this has been already asked with a marker on a map, but the cache details are not downloaded in this case, so it has no sense. But in an offline list, we have these logs. The filter would just check if there is at least one &quot;found&quot; log. What do you think about it ?

		..or improve it to make it more reliable. Several users contact us regularly having problems with strange waypoints automatically created by parsing of the personal note. There seem to be cases, where we parse nonsense. One example I received today: Personal note content:    A=6 B=0 C=5 D=4 E=13

   N 48° 53.(A*C*E)+194   E 009° 11.((D*71)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.(6*5*13)+194  E 009° 11.((4*71)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.(390)+194     E 009° 11.((284)-0)-1
   N 48° 53.584           E 009° 11.283
 c:geo creates the following waypoint as parsing result: N 48° 53,000  E 006° 00,000
 This means users might see a lot of incorrect waypoints on their map without a possibility to permanentely remove them. So I suggest to either improve the parsing or add an option to disable it in general so that affected users have a solution.

		from facebook: Does cgeo automatically decode encrypted logs? I have permanently encrypted a log entry on one of my caches as it gave clues to the cache location. On the web page the entry appears encrypted but cgeo shows it in plain text. GC59E5Z, log entry for 27 Aug 15 This is because we use the &quot;Decrypt&quot; button functionality when fetching logs. It should be possible rather easily to instead fetch the non decrypted JSON. I'm just wondering if we would need a new database column for log entries. To my mind it should in principle not matter for our app whether the stored log text is actually encrypted or not. Clicking it in the UI will just toggle, independent of whether we known its state. Am I right with that concept? If so, we could probably just pimp the JSON parser.

The method for refreshing a cache needs also to be adapted for the case that the local header coordinates have been corrected. Then the original coordinates in waypoints must be updated with the Listing coordinates instead of the header coordinates. [...] I often perform bulk refresh of mixed lists that contains also traditional caches. In this case I don't want to lose the corrected coordinates of letterbox or Wherigo caches. I did not know that it is the default behavior of c:geo to overwrite the local corrected coordinates with the listing coordinates. I think the current issue can be closed and the behavior of overwriting corrected coordinates while refreshing a cache may be discussed as subject of another issue. Sorry for the confusion.

		In order to optimize the usability of the possibility to have a cache on more than on list: Instead of the new multiple buttons for ¨Remove from list¨ couldn`t we just make the list selection dialog checkbox based and keep the remaining UI elements on cache details as they have been before? IMHO this would have some advantages: Moving a cache from one list to another currently got more complicated than before No cluttering of buttons on cache detals page Simultanous storing to multiple lists possible in one dialog Doing it like this would also bring it more into the direction of the discussed ¨tag¨ strategy

		Feature request: add an option to bring back the old behaviour for the lists: each cache can only be part of 1 list. (an option, because I do understand the new way of handling lists and its advantages for lots of users.) Use case: create a pocket query (or run an existing one) and add the caches to a new list. A couple of days later you run the same PQ and also add those to a new list. So you get 2 lists with caches. Best after new caches became part of the new list, or other ones removed, etc. old behaviour: The new list has the number of caches included in the PQ, the old one only lists those caches that aren't included anymore (disabled, found, new caches made them disappear etc.) It is easy to look at those and decide which ones to keep or remove. new behaviour: You get 2 lists with no easy way of telling the difference. If you want to make sure you don't have caches on the device which are not useful anymore, you can only clear the old list. It is possible you clear caches that can still be useful for future trips. In my case I create one using pocket query creator every couple of days, or before I go geocaching, with only the 1000 closest enabled caches that are active and haven't been found be me. With the old behaviour I ended up with up to 3-4 lists with caches, I only had to remove those I found or were disabled. I do not log with c:geo on the device I have with me on trips, so found caches are not marked as found on that device and it also doesn't have an internet connection during trips.

After this, we can freely move status.cgeo.org to another host. Note that older installations using the Heroku address will be able to be redirected using the Free plan since they will not use our custom domain when talking to Heroku.

The only issue, especially when you move many trackables like myself, most of the time the user doesn't know the name of the trackable, only knows the code. So putting the codes alphabetically would be amazing and much faster. I never thought about that, but I fully agree. If I put trackables into the cache I always look for its tracking number and sorting by that would indeed make this more easy. Maybe we could also put it into the first row (bigger font) and the name into the second row (smaller font) or make both lines with same font size. ❤️ 1

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Open detail page of a cache Click on owner name Actual behavior after performing these steps: A menu with many options is shown, however simply copy the user name is missing Expected behavior after performing these steps: Add an menu entry to copy the owner name Version of c:geo used: 2017.02.23-NB1 Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes/No System information: Attach system information here if available (see c:geo menu -&gt; About c:geo -&gt; Swipe right to System)
Keep the apostrophe at beginning and end to have it properly formatted
 Other comments and remarks: Same for all other menus, where the user can click on a users name (e.g. logbook)

		Hi, Cgeo remove the first log created by GSAK when user refresh caches. This first log contains personnal notes, it is alway the first log of the cache in the GSP created by GSAK. The user is always GSAK. Would it be possible to keep this log even after a refresh ? Detailed steps causing the problem: GSAK : Create some caches with personnal notes GSAK : Export GPX with options - include user notes in export - Extra informations to show in first log = %UserNote CGEO : Import the GPX (i put a gpx as attachement) CGEO : You can see the notes in first log of caches CGEO : Refresh all caches CGEO : The log created by GSAK as been removed Gpx.zip Many thanks for your software Best regards Pierre

In that issue I suggested a restructuring of the main cache list menu. Actual behaviour: A lot of menu items... Suggestion: Restructuring of the menu like this: Show on map Filter Sort Switch select mode Invert select mode Manage cashes ** Refresh all / selected ** Move all / selected ** Copy all / selected ** Remove all / selected ** Delete offline-logs ** Delete past events Manage lists ** Create new list ** Remove current list ** Rename current list ** Make list unique Import ** Import GPX ** Import from send2cgeo ** Import from Android Export ** Export GPX ** Field notes ** Personal notes Remove from history

		There are some users on social media and support mail asking us, why suddenly they do see a large amount of geocaching related pictures in their gallery apps. It seems, that some gallery apps also scan below /Android/data for media files and thus show them in the overview. I am not sure, if there is any standard or guideline if these folders should be scanned for media (e.g. on my S7 the default gallery app is not showing them). We could think about placing a .nomedia file into the base dir of GeocacheData. What do you think?

		As I just learned it is not possible anymore for a owner to log &quot;Needs Maintenance&quot; (NM) for his own geocaches. Therefore I registered a second account on geocaching.com which I want to use only to log NM. Also, my girlfriend has her own account, and sometimes, when she forgot to take her mobile phone with her, she wants to use my phone to log a geocache. But of course she doesn't remember her password. Would it be possible to add a multi user feature and make it possible to switch users fast and simple by selecting a user from a list of saved users within cgeo? Thanks, Christian 👎 2

		From #6704 Interesting. I thought temporarily about linking the 'Calculator notes' with the 'waypoint notes' (or 'user notes') but didn't end up giving it much thought and just implemented a 3rd 'notes' field exclusively for the calculator. Would you find it more useful to have these notes merged in some way? If so I'll look at it as another ticket. Yes, I see no benefit having two separate notes. I feel it as an disadvantage to not see the calculator notes in the waypoint overview. If the calculator is used this usually contains information (e.g. variables and formulas) which might be interesting for other waypoints, too.

		We use linking in the personal notes to detect hyperlinks that may be in there. However, given that personal notes often contain values for mystery caches, the phone number linking kicks in for every 2+ digit number in the personal notes as an unwanted side effect. It would be nice if we could still have hyperlinks detected, but suppress phone number detection at the same time.

		Just making this ticket as a way to track the suggestion that @pstorch made in #6704 that: I'm thinking about if we should change the button modes. With a short press it toggles between variable and original value. Maybe it should also toggle through the &quot;space&quot; case. So that this feature is more accessible. If that comment doesn't quite make sense out of context what @pstorch is suggesting is: Perhaps rather than simply having the calculator buttons toggle between 'Input-value&quot; and &quot;Auto-char&quot; (with the blank option being available by entering SPACE through a long press) that the calculator buttons have three states, being &quot;Input-value&quot;, &quot;Auto-char&quot; and &quot;Blank&quot;. Note that the &quot;Custom-char&quot; functionality will still be available through a long press, it just won't be the way you &quot;blank-out&quot; buttons.

		This is just being created in order to track the discussion in #6773 about allowing non-standard letters to be used in equations. @rsudev commented: A-Z (if that really is the definition) is less ambiguous than LETTER (which in some places might end up being äöü or even åđžć ... and @UniQP said: I would prefer to allow all characters accepted by Character.isLetterOrDigit(...) and simply use letter and digit in the message. Is that feasible? And later on @pstorch commented: Regarding the letter and digit discussion: at the moment it is ambiguous. Just tried ö, which is a letter, and got the above error message. I personally think we should restrict the variable letters to A-Z. If we allow all unicode letters from all languages, then we might run into sorting issues again. So, to avoid that and make things simple, I would suggest A-Z letters only. What do you think?

		As mentioned in #6716 (Managing ambiguous results in WP Calc where trailing/leading zeros are involved) it can be necessary to insert additional zeros into the result of a formulation, and in some instances there is contention as to whether these should be 'leading-zeros' or 'trailing-zeros'. It has been suggested that a method of identifying how a result has been manipulated would be desirable and a suggestion made is to colour the 'manipulated' digits differently to provide this indication: Developer notes: Implementing this is not as trivial as one might at first think for a few reasons: The main concern is that the text to display for a valid location is actually obtained from the waypoint itself rather than from the input strings used to create it. This is done specifically so that users can be aware of exactly what the resulting waypoint will actually represent rather than their entered value (which may result in something they did not expect). Although we have access to both the input string and the resulting GeoPoint's string displaying a 'diff' of these two strings is not as trivial as you may think. However, once it is known what colours should be used for each letter actually displaying the desired results shouldn't be too hard given TextView's support the use of HTML strings. Further notes: Once implemented this &quot;Syntax Highlighting&quot; would be most useful in conveying information to users of what leads to &quot;Parsing Failures&quot; (as related to #6802: Coordinate Parser Needs Work).

			<label>Feature Request</label>
			<description>
		This was already discussed at the end of #6697. There are various ways you can get unwanted coordinates in a waypoint: you just want to add a note there you prepare waypoint calculator formulas in advance In all these cases arbitrary coordinates (usually your current position) are stored into the waypoint and there is no way to get them removed again. This has different disadvantages: you cannot distinguish between a waypoint with correct or incorrect coordinates it pollutes the waypoint map with wrongly placed waypoints This is of course more problematic for caches with lots of stages: you get a wild mixture of valid and arbitrary coordinates. Therefore it would be nice to have an action to remove waypoint coordinates from a waypoint. The implementation for this is trivial. It acts in the same way as the &quot;Delete&quot; action in the waypoint context menu. This means, there is no confirm dialog and there is no different behavior for user created waypoints or listing waypoints. The latter can be restored by a cache refresh again. I will share my changes tonight. 👍 2
