		There's no way to select multiple messages under a conversation to either copy, export or delete them (or any other action that I can't think of). The same is true for conversations. I've seen other apps handle this by either adding a option of &quot;Select&quot; under the long press menu, or the 3-dot menu. This option selects the message (or conversation) and lets you click on others to keep selecting. The 3-dot menu would have all the actions you can perform to those messages (or conversations). üëç 5

However, when i tested the same gif on another sms app (Textra), it sent perfectly and was animated on the receiving side (as well as on senders side). Thanks for your time.

		Hi, I love your app but it miss a feature that prevents me to use your app. I use the default messaging app on the ASUS Zenfone 2, ASUS Messaging. Normally SMS are listed in the Main category. Then, there are two other categories: VIP: shows all messages of VIP contacts, set in the ASUS Contacts app. Those message are shown also in the main section and the profile pic has a VIP badge Private: all messages sent in the Private category are protected by a numeric password. Those messages are not shown in the main category I don't use VIP category but I use Private category and by now, QKSMS doesn't show any private messages, as they have been deleted. Is it possible to implement categories? Instead of just VIP category, you should implement a category for every group in the contacts.

			<description>
		Scenario: after working with qksms (composing, sending...) and you changed the app or switched off the display and go back to qksms: Current behaviour: qksms is exactly continued at the screen where you left it (despite a real &quot;kill app&quot; was performed) This behaviour is OK for a couple of minutes, if you want directly jump into the old conversation again. Desired behaviour: If qksms is inactive for, let's say 5 min, it should start again in the main message screen to have a better overview. Could be opt-in in settings (with desired minutes, or disabled). In the past it happended very often for me, that I don't want to see the old conversation again while there no new messages have been received. But I want to check the other conversations or start a new one --&gt; main screen is neccassary.

			<label>Feature</label>
			<description>
		DESCRIPTION It would be extremely helpful in certain situations if 2 or more conversations could be merged into a single conversation. Example in case of a person having 2 different mobiles numbers and using whichever depending on which has the best reception at his location. A conversation with him will be split over 2 unless both can be merged. Also commercial SMS say from a bank arrive from different headers such as VM-SBI, VX-SBI, TV-SBI etc. Merging them into a common SBI or a user selected option could make life much easier. This feature is present in another application called Disa.

OBSERVATIONS Message is converted into a MMS without notification or confirmation. Annoying when you want to save data or you don't expect the recipients to spend data. POSSIBLE WORKAROUND If the option that breaks long messages into many SMS instead is checked, make the message long enough to be broke into at least two bits. For example add a lot of spaces followed by a dot. Doesn't seem to work with short messages though. Doesn't work with forwarding or copied MMS either, but likely because of encoding.

		Feature request Support for &quot;Google Voice&quot; text (SMS/MMS) messaging functionality. Description I (like other people I know) use my &quot;Google Voice&quot; phone number as my primary contact number for calls and text messages. Up until recently, I have been using Google Hangouts as my texting app (SMS/MMS) because it allowed me to send and receive messages BOTH through the text messaging features provided by my carrier (Sprint) AND through the TCP/IP based Google Voice service. (Note: I have my Google Voice number set as the default to send messages from, but the Google Hangouts app allows me to select standard SMS when a new conversation is created.) I really liked having both messaging features in one app! UNFORTUNATELY, Google has decided to remove SMS/MMS functionality from Google Hangouts. To make matters worse, there don't seem to be any other apps that support both SMS/MMS and Google Voice messaging.

		I noticed when using Preview 6, when using Gboard to select a GIF to send from within a conversation thread already started, QKSMS would open a new message dialog, requiring us to reselect the recipient. Even upon doing so, the GIF is not added to the message (i.e. there is no preview as there is after selecting a photo from system storage.) üëç 1

		When halfway through typing a message, and I click the back arrow to return to the conversation list, the message I typed is entirely deleted when returning. Assuming this behaviour is due to the 3.0 rewrite and should be fixed soon, but wanted to bring it to your attention. If I could suggest my view on how it should work: When clicking back, text of draft message is saved and remains in box when returning to specific conversation. Conversation in question moves to the top of the list (or to the point in time when the draft message was last edited, so if a newer message arrives, its conversation goes above the draft's). Text of conversation becomes italicized, or some other method of being able to tell at a glance that this message is a draft. Apologies if this is already known, I'm otherwise loving the update!

		I'm very much of a pack rat and NEED to be able to keep a record of all past messages but this gets very cluttered obviously. The ability to hide conversations without deleting it's contents is important to me and something this app lacks the ability to do. This is a pretty big QOL improvement and I honestly can't use the app until then. The default Google client allows this with a swipe and I would honestly like to have the same for this app.

		I feel like this is a crucial feature which makes QKSMS stand out among other alternative SMS apps. Not only was this a unique feature that worked slightly differently from other SMS apps that claim to have floating reply windows, but it worked much better and much smoother. Is there any chance you can implement this in QKSMS 3.0? üëç 5

		Currently, the app will automatically try to send the message as a group message, rather than allowing you to send it individually as an SMS to each recipient. This will require quite a bit of design work/thinking, as the current design doesn't accommodate for this behavior.
