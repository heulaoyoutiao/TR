		When adding a new feed the text &quot;Type in the URL of the Feed here&quot; is at the same position as the &quot;confirm&quot; and &quot;cancel&quot; which looks somekind of strange... Here is a screenshot: It's probably a known issue but I thought it would be better to report it incase it isn't.

			<description>
		I always have the problem that I can't find the podcast that I have already downloaded when I am offline. Therefore I asked myself if it would be possible to add an option which would automatically add every downloaded Podcast to the queue?

		I am not able to listen to Podcasts in the ogg vorbis format, I can download them with AntennaPod and play them with my music player, but I can't directly play them with AntennaPod.

		I don't know if this is a bug or if this is planned but AntennaPod also displays me RSS Items which doesn't have a enclosure tag and because AntennaPod is a podcatcher I would prefer it if it would only display those items which actually have a enclosure tag.

			<description>
		I am not so sure if this is a bug or if this is a feature but I think the back button in the top left corner should take me to the previous antennapod screen(even if this is some kind of a duplicated functionality because the android back button alreday does that kind of thing). For example if you select a podcast in the new screen and press the top left corner button it will take you to the screen which displays all podcasts of this specific podcast and not the previous screen(which was the new screen in this example).

			<description>
		Could you add a .nomedia file to the directory where antennapod stores podcast images and podcasts by default? Because this will prevent the gallery from indexing podcast covers. Besides it will prevent music players from indexing podcasts, which is a usefull thing(at least I think so).

		Is wiould be great if AntennaPod would be available in languages other than English. It could be done using https://www.transifex.com/ for example. I'd volunteer to translate it to Russian.

		I have Novo7 Paladin tablet: http://www.ainovo.com/novo7paladin-specs.html and I don't see AntennaPod in Google Play on this device. At the same time other podcast managers (podkicker, doggcatcher) are available. Also, I downloaded and installed apk on this device and it works perfectly. Is there something in android manifest which could be the reason for this?

		Hi, in my eyes has your software the most potential to will the best podcast app on android market. :) Playlist Support (minimum Audio and Video Podcast playlist) podcast will delete after listen 2.a. mark podcast to hold on the phone &quot;cloud&quot; sync for multiple devices Video Playback (i can not test it on my phone during crashes) i hope you will bring much more tools on the app. regards, Thomas

			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		First off, thank you for your work. I'm glad someone has put together a good open source podcast app to replace Google Listen. Now, on to the problem. When I add two feeds from the CBC no new entry is created for the second one, but podcasts for the second start appearing in the list for the first. The CBC seems to be keeping all their XML files in the same directory (and this may be the source of the problem). To reproduce this, add the following feed: &quot;http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/spark.xml&quot; For me it shows up correctly in the feeds tab Then add &quot;http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/writersandco.xml&quot; No new feed appears, but podcasts for the second feed start to appear in the list for the first. To me this seems to be incorrect behaviour. Perhaps the URL used for the first feed is being replaced with the second -- I can't tell from what I'm seeing. You can reverse the order of adding the feeds -- the first feed added appears, the second always gets &quot;added&quot; to the first. If either feed is on a different host (for example NPR) two separate feeds are created and seem to work correctly. Perhaps the problem is that both of these XML files contain the link to the same site: &quot;http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting&quot;, even though they are different and separate feeds. Thanks again. Tony

			<description>
		One of the annoyances I've had with trying out any new podcast app is that I have to manually re-type in the urls of all of the podcasts that I have already subscribed to in Google Listen. This is true of AntennaPod as well, because few of the podcasts I want are in the Miro guide. I suspect that I am not the only one with this issue. I also suspect (though I don't know) that Listen is the most widely used podcatcher on Android. Perhaps is would help adoption of the app if the user could easily import their existing podcast subscriptions in Listen. I know nothing of what is involved in implementing such a feature, or if it is even possible. I believe a similar feature exists in Firefox for Android, where bookmarks and cookies can be imported from &quot;Browser&quot;. Thanks for your attention Tony PS: None of this would be (as much of) an issue if I could get Firefox (or Browser) to subscribe to a podcast by simply tapping on the RSS link. Perhaps I'm just missing something obvious.

		When i listen to a podcast i just listen, i don't look a the show notes. After i listened a episode completely the episode is removed from the play list. If i want to browse through the show notes i have to retrieve the episode in &quot;feeds&quot; → &quot;podcast name&quot; → &quot;list of episodes&quot;. I think a simply list which provides the last fifteen episodes which are completely listened would be a great time saver. BTW: The &quot;automatic delete&quot;-function should skip items of this list. Therewith it is easy to listen to something again. Hope my request is comprehensible :) Greetings lightonflux

		One feature that present in some podcast players, e.g. DoubleTwist, PocketCasts, etc., that I miss in AntennaPod is Forward and Backward Buttons, i.e. a button that skips ahead 30 seconds and one that skips behind 10 seconds. In regards to the interface, I think PocketCasts actually nailed it by making the buttons large overlays on the image art. Clicking to the right of the image art skips ahead 30 seconds. Clicking to the left of the image art skips behind 10 seconds. It makes it much easier to use the buttons blindly.

		I don't think I have ever fully grasped what a &quot;New&quot; episode is. I guess it's new because it's been added recently? How recently? When does a new episode stop being new? Do I need to listen to it for it to become old, or does it automatically after some time? This suggestion is kind of related to #79 in that new and old episodes are added to the same list. The suggestion is to do away with the concept of &quot;New&quot; episodes and replace it with a concept much easier to grasp: &quot;Downloaded&quot; vs. &quot;Undownloaded&quot; episodes. The idea is that you have only one queue, and all new episodes are added to the bottom of that queue. The ones at the top are downloaded automatically when you have a WiFi connection, and then deleted after you listen to them in order to make room for new ones. That way you always have fresh new episodes ready to be listened without having to use 3G data, and you never have to worry about which ones you download because the application takes care of that by itself. Why separate downloaded episodes from undownloaded ones, then, if it's just one list? To let you know which ones you can listen to without using your data connection. That way, if there is one episode that attracts you in the &quot;Undownloaded&quot; section you can download it while you're at home, which will add it to &quot;Downloaded&quot; and let you listen to it on the go.

			<description>
		Several issues suggest using auto-download. In order to have that we need the app to do the following: Devote some of the phone's memory to store podcasts when they are added to the playing queue. Erase already listened episodes in order to make room for new ones. This brings two problems: There needs to be a way to decide how much space is given. Episodes shouldn't be erased IMMEDIATELY after being listened, because if you like an episode and want to listen to it again you would have to use additional data. As a result, there needs to be a way to decide how much space is given to listened episodes. Therefore, two settings are needed: Disk space for cached episodes (by default: 10%). Disk space for listened episodes (by default: 5%). If you had a phone with 8GB memory AntennaPod would automatically download and enqueue new episodes until they reached 800MB, at which point it would stop. Additionally, listened episodes would be kept until they reached 400MB, at which point the older ones would be deleted from the memory. A user with a lower-end phone but really into podcasts could use those settings in order to devote more space.

		I have been trying the test version for a couple days and it seems to check for new episodes, add them to the queue and download them automatically alright when I press the Refresh button. The only problem I see is that I have to press the button. The idea behind making everything automatic is that the user can add the podcasts he wants and forget about AntennaPod, and the app will still do its thing and serve him new episodes in a silver plate. To manage that the app shouldn't wait until the user opens it and presses Refresh. It should keep working in the background, checking for new episodes every so often (Daily? When the phone is charging and on WiFi?) and if it finds them, enqueue and download them automatically. And of course then let the user know, which is issue #122.

		I had several hundred podcasts (downloaded files) on my 32Gb SD card. When I upgraded from v0.9.7 to v0.9.7.3, most of those files disappeared. Some of those I cannot re-download, because they come from feeds that make files available for only a short period of time (some BBC feeds, NHK, etc.). From what I could read in other issues, it seems that this might not be a bug but a feature. Can you confirm this? Is there a way to preserve files forever and only delete manually? In any case, it would have been nice if the user had been informed of such a behavior change, one that erases user files... I have been greatly pleased using AntennaPod, it has been very comfortable to use and works (almost) flawlessly, so it came as a shock when my files disappeared. :-(

Then you turn off the phone to give back the SD card, when you start AP again you have no way to prevent it from crashing. Tested on my smartphone with Android 4.1.2.

		I've got a bunch of downloaded audio files on my phone's SD card: podcast episodes that are not available in their feeds anymore. It would be great to be able to create a &quot;feed&quot; by pointing AntennaPod to that specific folder on the SD card. (Sorry if this is a duplicate, can't seem to find the search function anymore on GitHub, likely fallout from when the GH issues search was &quot;leaking&quot; passwords?)

		I have used Google Listen from when I got my Android phone to when the Google Reader service was discontinued. I tried BeyondPod and AntennaPod before the service ended and decided to stick with AntennaPod. They are both good, but one is free and open source :) The only feature I really miss now that I am using AntennaPod is that Google Listen would pause and resume playback during voice navigation. I think this would be a great convenience feature to add. I am willing to make a donation.

		AntennaPod downloads episodes even if not enough space is on the device. So it downloads a episode of 100MB and then says &quot;oh sorry not enought space left on device&quot;. That's not funny if you only have some 100MB or 1GB of full speed mobile internet and then the bandwith drops to unusable for AntennaPods download mechanism. Why doesn't AP checks if enough space is left before downloading a whole episode? I know there are some cases where you don't know how big the file will be, but in most cases it not a problem.

Episodes are played at maybe 10% of the normal speed. Increasing the playback speed changed something, but even 3x wasn't fast enough to make any speech understandable. Strangely, the time display looked normal, only the audio was too slow.

   Explanation for issues of type &quot;ValidFragment&quot;:
   From the Fragment documentation:
   Every fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated
   when restoring its activity's state. It is strongly recommended that
   subclasses do not have other constructors with parameters, since these
   constructors will not be called when the fragment is re-instantiated;
   instead, arguments can be supplied by the caller with setArguments(Bundle)
   and later retrieved by the Fragment with getArguments().

		I'm running 0.9.8.2 on a Moto X with Android 4.2.2. I have auto download set but new podcasts are only added to the Waiting List but not downloaded. Aren't they supposed to be downloaded right away? It's possible I do not fully understand how the Waiting List and auto download works, but I compare to Podkicker Pro where new shows are downloaded as soon as a refresh finds a new episode. I am running Podkicker also to compare and it is downloading the new episodes right away.

		So, apparently the newest version downloads episode pictures. My issue is that most of my podcast provide an image for each episode (although it's apparently always just the logo/image of the podcast itself) and with some feeds containing 100+ or even 300+ episodes, I now have an &quot;images&quot; folder with 100+mb of completely useless copies of a few podcast images, and that was after I quit the update by force-closing the app halfway through. One example is &quot;Stop Podcasting Yourself&quot;.. over 300 episodes and each one has a 500kb 1400x1400px jpg file. So the images from that podcast alone would use up ~150mb on my phone. And that's just one podcast. It's the most egregious example, but it's a problem with many feeds. Judge John Hodgman for example..150x152kb. Especially for people with limited data, actually doing that first refresh with the newest version can really screw you over (luckily I was on wifi). But even then, 100-200mb for pointless episode images is a waste considering the limited storage on most phones. Additionally it seems like a download queue of 1000+ can crash the app. There needs to be a way to deal with this and imho it shouldn't be default behavior, especially not on mobile data.

		I have a whole bunch of podcasts in my AntennaPod with some of them being feeds from radio stations, which generate a lot episodes (several per day) and where I'm only interested in single episodes. Every other day (like once a week or so) I browse through all the podcasts I have in my list and add the episodes I'm interested in to my playlist. This is of course easiest done by selecting one source and going to all the new tracks there and then proceed with the next source. Therefore I then end up with a playlist that has the tracks in the order in which I have added them, i.e. with lets say 5 tracks from radio station A then two from station B and so on. Especially with topics that are currently in the news it would be convenient if there was an option to sort the tracks chronologically by their release date. For example a menu (maybe also with other sort orders) in the &quot;organize playlist&quot; view could do that.

		Hi, The Frontline audio podcast suddenly started to kill AntennaPod. Every time I refreshed AntennaPod died without any error message. I removed all feeds and added one at a time from my opml until I got to the one that made AntennaPod crash. It was Frontline from PBS. The feed URL is: http://feeds.feedburner.com/FrontlineAudiocastPbs This feed has worked until today. I do not mind that some feeds may not work with AntennaPod, but that a feed kills the app instantly is difficult to work with and troubleshoot. It took quite a while getting through all my feeds to find the perpetrator! :)

			<description>
		I have a few ideas for refactorings I’d like to run by the project. When I implemented OPML backup I saw some places where I think it would be beneficial for the app to “offload” functionality to other libraries and services. Less code (and sources of bugs) at the expense (possibly) of less control. Specifically, EventDistributor can be replaced (or backed) with LocalBroadcastManager that ships with the support libaries This is a small change and would be straight forward to implement. The EventDistributor API could stay the same. Use Volley (or other library designed to download small files) to download feeds and images (it also does caching) Use the Download Manager to download podcasts and videos Getting HTTP downloads right is not straight forward (AntennaPod has 8 classes for this purpose) and requires threads, locks, background services and notifications to work properly. Download Manager takes care of all that and does retries as well as handles connectivity failures. It is not clear that using Download Manager would work exactly the same as the current solution, but I think it will and I’m willing to give it a shot. I appreciate all the time and effort that was put in to these parts of the app, and would totally understand if there's hesitation in changing them too much. The obvious reason not to is that it currently works. Also, these changes would not change how AntennaPod functions or looks. If, however, you think it’d be a good idea to simplify the code base then I would be interested in seeing if we can make it work. What do you think?

			<description>
		Hi, after the 0.9.9.0 release with the new UI became available on F-Droid I was finally able to test the new UI. Some feedback from my perspective: I like that there is finally a view that shows all downloaded items. Great that play list manipulation (moving up/down etc.) is much easier now. I seem to accidentally swipe off episodes too easily, but that may be just my clumsy fingers. Deletion on long press or context menu or so might be safer. Please bring back display of playing time and possibly release date and podcast name to items in the playlist. This seems to be only available in the Downloads/Finished view. Release date and podcast name should at least be avaibale from the episode detail view. But playing time is quite essential for me. One thing that feels really completely wrong is that in the All Episodes view, when trying to scroll up from the top of the list, a refresh of all podcasts is triggered. This alone makes this view completely unusable for me. Please note that this process can take quite some time and it seems that other parts (Playlist etc.) are not accessible at all. (I have a lot of podcasts and not the fastest device on the market.) IMO it should only be triggered explicitly and not accidentally when scrolling a list where one even cannot see whether one is at the top of the list or not. Even worse as when entering the app from the widget and clicking in the upper left of the player one ends up automatically in this view. Also there is the refresh button in the upper right, why should one be able to trigger this in another way? Anyway, please keep up the good work and thanks for releasing the software for free. Edit: It would also be great if the number of contained episodes would be visible again at the top of the list as before.

		When the &quot;All episodes&quot; view is empty there are 3 icons in the right upper corner: search synchronize (look for new episodes) menu But when there are some episodes the synchronize option moves into the menu and instead there is the &quot;mark all as read/listen&quot; icon. In my opinion this option should be in the menu and the synchronize icon should always be on the view in the upper corner. It's too easy to unintentionally click the &quot;mark all as read/listen&quot; icon and loose all new episodes

		I love this app! But there's one bug that is getting me on the brink of switching. Not always, but very often, when I come back to an episode that I've started listening to before, it does not resume from where I paused it. It does not matter if I have played another episode since or if I just paused this episode, closed the app and came back later. Often the seeker is at the correct place, but when I hit play, it jumps either to the very begining of the episode, or to somewhere close to the beginning. I've had this issue since the previous version of AntennaPod, and on two different phones with both stock Android and Cyanogenmod. I'm using 0.9.9.0 now, and it's the same. I hope this will be fixed soon. I'd hate to switch to a non-Free podcast app and I really want to be able to recommend AntennaPod to my friends! Thanks!

I've reproduced this on several feeds, e.g. TED http://feeds.feedburner.com/TedtalksHD , and the same thing happens both on my Nexus 4 and my Nexus 7. Audio-only content works fine.

		The first time you add a podcast, app tries to download all of the entries of the podcast, even the very old ones. That makes an annoying attempt to download episodes that already don't exist (404 error) and notification bar shows the error again and again. A configurable limit by number (since the last one) or by date should be supported. In this way, Antennapod would &quot;forget&quot; the old entries when the automatic download is enabled.

			<description>
		Hey, first off, love AntennaPod. Just have been having some weird issues that seem to be independent of any updates to the app or Android. As far as I can tell, they appeared out of nowhere. The biggest issue is that pushing the play button next to a podcast in the queue no longer plays the podcast. instead, it takes me to the playback screen of the currently playing podcast (which remains paused). I can push the play button in the queue repeatedly and sometimes after a few presses it will take me to the playback screen and I can hit play again and the cast plays, but sometimes it can be upwards of 20 presses. If there is not a podcast currently playing then I can switch to any other podcast. Sometimes I will get an playback error message and then the playback screen will come up empty and I can play a new podcast then. Another (I'm guessing) related issue is that continuous playback is checked but when a podcast ends and a new one loads, it does not play automatically. Continuous playback is checked in the setttings. I'm running version 0.9.9.3 on a Republic Wireless Moto X running Android 4.4.2

		I have an issue with AntennaPod. After downloading a lot of podcasts, it does not play podcasts any more. I'll try to describe the problem and its circumstances. I had no previous issues with antenna pod. It all worked flawlessly Suddenly, Antennapod would not play any episode anymore. This was correlated with me downloading quite a few new podcasts episodes. Although I do not know whether this is a coincidence or if there is more to this. At the moment, I can see the &quot;Abspielliste&quot;, &quot;Alle Episoden&quot; etc. but as soon as I play an episode, antennapod stalls and crashes eventually before playing one sound.

		In the latest version Antenna Pod stopped playing podcasts through BT. The phone seems to be paired and connected correctly, but plays the podcast through the internal speaker of my nexus 5 (Lollipop). However, When I shutdown the BT Audio device, AntennaPod still notices that the connection was lost, and stops the podcast, even though it was played through the internal speaker. When I play AntennaPod first, and only then I turn on the BT device, it connects, the music plays through the BT device for ~1 sec, and then switches back to the internal speaker! All of this used to work 100% a day or two ago. System Info: Phone: Nexus 5 with Lollipop. 2 BT devices: Jabra Cruiser2 configured only for &quot;Phone Audio&quot; and &quot;Contact Sharing&quot; Generic Chinese A2DP BT to 3.5mm stereo adapter (BT ID is &quot;H163&quot;), configured for &quot;Media Audio&quot;

			<description>
		In the menu you can set a fast forward/backward step width between 5 and 60 seconds. This value will be applied on both, forward and backward. The most frequent use cases for fast forward/backward are (in my opinion/experience): you want to skip some less interesting passage and find a point to continue listening you want to repeat a passage of about the last minute, maybe you have not listened to concentrated enough and and you must find the exact starting point again For both use cases an unsymmetric forward/backward step size which allows you to step forward coarse and find the exact point stepping backward fine. For example Linux Totem Video Player uses this technique with fixed step sizes of +60s / -15s. It is very easy to find a desired point by this means. My suggestion is to gives the possibility to selcet forward/backward step widths independantly by providing: separate inputs for both values - or - an input for fast forward and an extra multiplier for backward ratio: 0.1 / 0.25 / 0.5 / 1 (optional additionally: 2 / 4 / 10)

It would really help if people could test the current release build, either by joining the AntennaPod Alpha Google Plus group (https://plus.google.com/communities/117446128636140585144) or by just downloading the latest release build here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4c475h3yst0ys38/AntennaPod-develop-current-release.apk?dl=0 Please report any new bugs that you encounter. As many of you know @danieloeh stopped maintaining the project with 1.0. I'm trying my best to maintain the project properly. If you see that I'm doing anything wrong please let me know. I'd like to thank @mfietz for all the hard works he's put in to fixing bugs and adding new features. He's probably responsible for 70-80% of the changes you'll see in version 1.1. Of course, a big thanks to everyone else that's contributed for this release, their changes have provided some great new features and fixes. Going forward, if anyone would like to contribute, the most valuable thing for me would be if you could build the proposed pull requests and test the functionality introduced in that request. If you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, just add a comment to the PR. If everything works well, please comment saying that everything works well. That will give me more confidence when merging the requests. Thanks everyone!

		I have a site which is fully protected by HTTP Basic Auth. When users try to add the feed in AntennaPod, they are prompted for the password twice, even though both the website and the feed are on the same domain and use the same HTTP Basic Auth realm. Steps to reproduce: Add the following site to AntennaPod: http://p.j-crew.de Enter the username and password (both are &quot;a&quot;, without the quotes) Confirm the RSS feed (there is only one) Expected result: The password from step 2 above is remembered and used for the feed and for downloading the MP3 files. Actual result: The user is queried again for the password after selecting the feed. Further information: The apache logs can be seen live at http://misc.j-crew.de/p-access.log and http://misc.j-crew.de/p-error.log (to see exactly which URLs were queried). There is an identical site except without HTTP Basic Auth at http://q.j-crew.de for comparison (with logs at http://misc.j-crew.de/q-access.log and http://misc.j-crew.de/q-error.log).

This resolves some issues that were reported by users who missed the All Episodes view and used it instead of the Queue. All things considered this is a fairly minor change. But some feedback would be welcome before we push it out to production. Are there any other immediate changes we should include in 1.1.1? My hope is to get this out quickly to help out folks that are currently broken, but if anything is missing and straightforward we could include it now (or in a 1.1.2). Changelog: Version 1.1.1 All Episodes and New Episodes are now both present Remembers which activity was last active instead of always going to the Queue When adding a podcast the most recent episode is considered 'new'

			<description>
		Hi, I would like to see a toggle option to have episodes deleted when swiped off the queue regardless of whether they are listened to or not. If that's not feasible a context menu option to delete the episode in addition to moving it up and remove it from the queue would be helpful. The way I use AntennaPod keeps me in the queue most of the time. That is where I play from (thank you for including direct playback from the queue) and organize my listening, so it would be great if I could delete episodes from there also.

		I use Tiny-Tiny RSS (a.k.a. TT-RSS) to manage my RSS feeds, including podcasts, but I generally prefer to use it as a backend for applications like Liferea on the desktop, which use TT-RSS's API to sync feeds. It'd be great if Antennapod could sync with TT-RSS similarly to the way it works with gpodder.net, with the ability to specify a particular folder/category within the TT-RSS tree as the root for podcasts and have new subscriptions added within Antennapod placed there, read/unread status updated as appropriate, etc. 👍 1

		Would it be possible to get an option to mark episodes of podcasts as new/unlplayed if they get accidentally played. At the moment the only way to reset the play status appears to be to play the podcast, pause it and manually scrub back to the start (00:00 time)

		I would like suggest a new feature that would show the number un-listened to or partially listened to episodes of each posdcast that you are subscribed to. This could be shown in the side menu next to or on top of the Podcast image. Best example of this implementation is doggcatcher here with all podcasts showing unlistened to episodes and &quot;The Month Podcast&quot; also showing the in progress episodes

		Hi Thanks for this app. It does the job for me except that I am confused about what I have listened and finished. It seems to me that there is no way to differentiate finished, marked as read etc from regular casts. For example I mark one mp3 as read but in the list it does not look any different. I can see that ones I dowloaded have a play icon. But that is the most visible identification that I can tell. I hope it makes sense. thanks

The download begins, I then click the download icon for podcast2_e05. As soon as I do this AntennaPod crashes/restarts with error unfortunately antennapod has stopped. The crash is always on the 2nd podcast in the list and no others (largest sample to date is 4). However if I try and download them in any other order than 1, 2, 3 the download works fine. If I do it in any order other than 1, 2, 3 and then cancel all downloads I am then able to download in order 1, 2, 3 with out a crash.

		Hi, I have only recently begun to experiment with AntennaPod, but I like it so far. This is more of a question than a bug report maybe. I'm wondering about the skip button and the auto delete behavior. I am on the Google play version 1.1.2 and I download episodes manually so far. I understand that there's a cache where episodes go after I listened to them and the oldest gets deleted from there once it's full. Or do all episodes go there once I download them and they delete no matter whether I ever listened to them? Is there a way to list all episodes that I have currently downloaded? Does the cache only work with auto-downloading? The auto-delete after playback option is in addition to the cache, isn't it? #111 talks about a skip button in relation to auto-deleting. This is exactly the behavior that I am looking for. However, the skip button is just not there on my phone. Or I cannot spot it :) The notification area only shows play / pause. What's the easiest way to get to the next episode? Kind regards, Matthias Kauer

		Hi, I'm no contributer to AntennaPod, but simply a single user observing some issues with the newest version of AntennaPod. The update was done automatically within my Wiko Rainbow (Android 4.4.2) at 16.06. First of all thank you for this marvellous piece of software. I'm that glad to have it as no other podcast-player on Android is that simple, minimalistic, stable and focused. With the newest update from 16.06.2015 I observe a significant delay in displaying the episodes-lists, the played list, the podcasts themselves, etc. The feature showing the unlistened episodes on the right side of the podcasts is great, however it looks like all the changes have changed the speed of the application overall. Showing the playing list with 321 entries needs more than 20 seconds. Potentially a problem with the length of the list as after deletion of the playing list things are fine again. However adding a podcast-episode to the playing list by using the context menu lasts ~10-15 seconds. Opening a podcast-overview lasts 2-3 seconds. That's definitely longer than before. Not dramatic, but new. But the most significant problem I observed first today having no internet connection at all. I have downloaded all the episodes and placed them in the playing list. Opening the playing list lasted approx. 40-50 seconds. Jumping back and opening one of the podcasts directly was not possible, no episodes were displayed. From my perspective AntennaPod seems to unusable if there's no internet connection even the episodes are downloaded. I could not observe this behaviour with the previously installed version. Perhaps you can use these details for further improvement. With a heavy heart I will have to search for another podcast-player. Ciao, Georg

			<description>
		Hello, I previously opened #796 requesting the addition of an uplayed count in the Nav bar which was added. However there were some strange UX choices added which I'd like to see if they can be changed. Prior to this feature being added, the podcast list in the navbar was sorted alphabetically, these was optimal as you always knew where a particular podcast was in the list. Once the unplayed count was added to the navbar it appears to have changed the sort order of the podcasts. This looks to be sorted now as 1) most unlistened, then 2) alphabetically. This gives a terrible user experience as you have to pay a lot more attention to the list as there is guarantee a podcast will be listed where you expect it. Can this be changed back to just doing it alphabetically while keeping the unplayed count?

			<description>
		As discussed in #441 The feeds were changed from alphabetical to number of unplayed episodes. Is it possible to make it an option? The two ways I use antennapod are affected by this: Listening to podcasts on demand: me or a friend have a specific feed that we want to listen to, so we want to pull up the feed, see if there are any new episodes or old episodes that we haven't listened to. Queuing up a small percentage of subscribed podcasts. I know some other people personally who are the same way. Detail from my previous post: I have a limited amount of time available to listen to podcasts compared to the amount of subjects and podcasts I'm interested in. Most of my feeds have a large amount of unplayed new episodes, but that tag is still useful to me: Subscribe to a large list of podcasts of various subjects (from educational to comedy to career-specific) Select a small amount of feeds to auto-download Add specific episodes to the queue (or for direct streaming) via description Let queue auto-download when on wifi Step 3 is of course what is affected by this: &quot;New Episodes&quot; tab mixes all the topics together low-frequency feeds can get lost amongst higher-frequency feeds. Static alphabetical view of podcast feeds allows quick access by subject or feed tagging may work as well as I saw in another thread, but one feed may be lighthearted or heavy on the same subject, where selecting individual feeds is still useful to me Unplayed tag still useful (in case marking all as read sorts it alphabetically) old unplayed podcasts are useful if I've exhausted my queue for that subject I'm open to suggestions in a better process for the same use case with the update. As the setting depends on your use case (which doesn't usually change), it should not be on the main UI, but rather somewhere in the settings, where I personally don't think it would be considered clutter.

		An option to change playback speed to a lower (when listening to foreign language or otherwise difficult podcasts) or higher (easy listening) setting would be very appreciated. This could probably be integrated in the interface by adding a button on the right of the playback controls in the player view, which would trigger a pop-up menu with available speeds, Youtube-style, or a separate pop-up with a slider. However, a brief search reveals that the Android API by default does not include a functionality to change playback speed. See this Android issue and also this SO question. So this FR will probably have to sit here for quite a while, unless someone decides to re-implement variable playback rate, or Google suddenly releases an update. I might have been mistaken though, as I am poorly familiar with the details of Android development, so someone should look into whether this is actually impossible with the current API.

		(Please advise where you would prefer I post requests for information if this is the wrong place) It seems strange to call it &quot;All Episodes&quot; when it specifically does not show all episodes. What is the reason for this? I want to update the All Episodes fragment to show all the episodes in a feed. It seems relatively simple - just change the value of RECENT_EPISODES_LIMIT to a large number. Are there concerns I should know about when doing this? It must have been set at some point for a reason, but I can't find reference in the code about it.

After installing the alfa I at first didn't change any settings, two days later I hadn't received any new podcasts (at this time I didn't check if any new episodes where available, but given the release schedule of my subscriptions there should have been some) so I went into the settings and checked to see if automatic download was still enabled, it was, I also set a download time (2 am). Today, two days later, I still hadn't gotten any new episodes so I went into each podcast feed (from the sidebar) and refreshed the feeds. It found 12 new episodes and the automatic download started.

		With the growth of the project, the current license is probably no longer sufficient as it leaves much unclear and not explicit. For example, it asks for the copyright notice to be included, but doesn't say anything about whether forked code should disclose source code or not (relevant comment) It's probably a good idea for the community or maintainers to discuss/decide on a more appropriate and comprehensive license. A good summary of popular licenses is available here. Some of the more popular licenses are listed here (scroll down). An alternative listing of popular licenses is available here.

		Hello, Today I did not use my Phone and the battery went from 80% to 10% in a few hours. A look in Wakelock Detector told me that my Phone was active all the time. AntennaPod (more exactly: com.aocate.media.ServiceBackedMediaPlayer) prevented the CPU from sleeping for 93% of the up time (since 1d and a few hours)! During this period I was in flight mode, did not listen to any episode and nothing was paused, either. So AntennaPod should have been (almost) completely inactive. After I forced AntennaPod to exit the battery stayed at 10% for 3 hours :) I use CyanogenMod 12.1 and AntennaPod 1.3.1.

		I synced with my gpodder.net account, which included several subscriptions that no longer have active RSS feeds. It seems that since AntennaPod has never successfully downloaded the feed, it doesn't appear in the subscription list, so I can't remove the dead subscription. I have unsubscribed via gpodder.net, but AntennaPod doesn't seem to be syncing the removal of a subscription. As a result, every time I refresh my podcasts, I get errors for four RSS feeds that I don't have listed in my subscriptions. Also, is there a way to get to the download history / error log from inside the app?

		Go to the menu, select &quot;Downloads&quot;. Then swipe to the &quot;Completed&quot; tab. The size of the downloaded podcast is shown next to the lower right corner of the podcast icon. Usually this is a plausible value. For example: &quot;21 MB&quot;. Occasionally it displays &quot;0 B&quot;. The download will still play, so this is not a failed download. This happens on AntennaPod 1.3.3.0. It occurs on both phones I use for podcasts: Moto G (XT1031) with Android 4.4.4. Kyocera Hydro Vibe (C6725) with Android 4.4.2 Some podcasts seem more likely to have this problem. But it does not happen consistently. &quot;On The Media&quot;, &quot;This American Life&quot;, and &quot;Planet Money&quot; seem to have it occur most frequently. This is a really minor issue. The strange download size is just a little confusing as it might indicate a problem with the download.

		This idea results from reading through the sleep timer improvements implemented with #1072 :-) Those could IMHO be supported by a function to dynamically reduce the playback speed (if Prestissimo is installed) from whatever the user has set to 1.0. It could work by simply distributing the Playback Speeds steps along the Sleep Timer's time axis with the 1st &quot;downstep&quot; happening immediately. Example: Speeds 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 and 1.75 are set upBefore starting the timer, playback is at 1.5x. Setting the sleep timer to 20min, the first 10min play at 1.25 (immediate downstep) and the last 10 at 1.0. If 1.75x was used before and 30min are then timed, 10min each would play at 1.5, 1.25 and 1.0.

		As @TomHennen suggested in #1152 (comment), I've been working on re-writing the app description. Below is my proposal. If you feel like adapting it, it's easiest to go over to this TitanPad. Please do fill in your GitHub username if you make changes; it makes any discussion easier. Please also provide some explanation if you changed things in the chat facility there. I'll only do a PR to change https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/description/en.txt if some consensus has been reached on the change (hence the TitanPad). Proposed description With AntennaPod you get instant access to millions of free and paid podcasts, from independent podcasters to large publishing houses such as the BBC, NPR and CNN. Add, import and export their feeds hassle-free using the iTunes podcast database, OPML files or simple RSS URLs. Save effort, battery power and mobile data usage with powerful automation controls for downloading episodes (specify times, intervals and WiFi networks) and deleting episodes (based your favourites and delay settings). But most importantly: Download, stream or queue episodes and enjoy them the way you like with adjustable playback speeds, chapter support and a sleep timer. And show your podlove to the content creators with our Flattr integration. Made by podcast-enthousiast, AntennaPod is free in all senses of the words: open source, no costs, no ads. All features: Easily add and import feeds via the iTunes and gPodder.net directories, OPML files and RSS or Atom links Manage playback from anywhere: homescreen widget, system notification and earplug and bluetooth controls Enjoy listening your way with adjustable playback speed, chapter support (MP3, VorbisComment and Podlove) and an advanced sleep timer (shake to reset, lower volume and slow down playback) Take control over automated downloading: choose feeds, exclude mobile networks, select specific WiFi networks, require the phone to be charging and set times or intervals Manage storage by setting the amount of cached episodes, smart deletion (based on your favourites and play status) and selecting your preferred location Share episodes and feeds through advanced social media and email options, the gPodder.net services and via OPML export Support content creators with Flattr integration including automatic flattring Keep track of the best of the best by marking episodes as favourites Find back that one episode through the playback history or by searching (titles and shownotes) Access password-protected feeds and episodes Take advantage of paged feeds (www.podlove.org/paged-feeds) Back-up your subscriptions with the gPodder.net integration and OPML export

			<description>
		Phone: Motorola Moto X 2011 Android Version: 5.1 Kernel version: 3.4.42-g756aa87 AntennaPod version: 1.4.0.2 The home screen widget is a 1-high-by-4-wide widget that lists the podcast's title, includes a track progress time indicator in the form of &quot;current hh:mm:ss / total hh:mm:ss&quot; and a play/pause button. If the AntennaPod app has not recently been opened, is not listed in the recent apps list, or was at some point exited by the Android OS to clear up RAM, the widget does not fully work. In this situation, you see the most recent track's title and the play button, but no progress/total time. Upon hitting the play button, I do see it's on/off-touch actions as the background highlights, but it does not start playing. At this point, I see two options: Option 1: First open the app (using its main icon or clicking elsewhere on widget) and then hit the play button. Now it's registered, and so when you go back to the widget, you now see the current/total time and the widget's play button will function. Option 2: First open the app (using its main icon or clicking elsewhere on widget), but then do not actually hit the play button. Go back to the widget. If you do this, the play button will now function, but the area of the widget which should show the current/total time is still blank. Once this happens, I can't figure out how to get the current/total time to show on the app again. Play/pause it as much as you want, either from the widget or within the app, it looks like the current/total time will not return to the app until the app is cleared from memory (by Android or by you manually) and you execute the steps listed above in Option 1. I know this is really corner case stuff. You have no obligation to address my issues, I'm just happy to provide you information.

		Phone: Motorola Moto X 2011 Android Version: 5.1 Kernel version: 3.4.42-g756aa87 AntennaPod version: 1.4.0.2 I use my phone with two different Bluetooth audio devices. These devices both include one &quot;forward&quot; and one &quot;back&quot; button. In the past, these buttons mapped to the in-track Rewind and Fast Forward functions, which would step back/forward some number of seconds. I liked that. It looks like this functionality changed. It seems now that the &quot;back&quot; hardware button on my Bluetooth devices does nothing within AntennaPod, while the &quot;forward&quot; button now skips to the next podcast file instead of fast forwarding in the current track. Unfortunately, I am unable to say with confidence if this change came about because of a recent update to AntennaPod, or with the recent upgrade my phone experienced from Android KitKat to Lollipop. Please feel free to swat this down if you're confident that no such changes were made on the AntennaPod side, or if this working as intended. Thanks for your consideration.

		AntennaPod currently resumes playing from the position where it was paused, but it would be nice to have an option to rewind a predetermined amount of time when resuming playback. The best solution would be to make the amount of time to rewind a function of the amount of time occurred between pause and resume, up to a certain limit, like 30 seconds or so. For example, it would rewind 10 seconds if we paused for 20 seconds or rewind 20 seconds if we paused for 40. If we paused for a minute or more, it would rewind 30 seconds.

For example, my wife has an iPhone has downloaded the last two episodes, and here is a comparison of the episode length from iTunes and AntennaPod: Friend of Jesus - Part Three (iTunes Run Time: 45:05, AntennaPod Run Time: 2:06:35) Friend of Jesus - Part Two (iTunes Run Time: 40:17, AntennaPod Run Time: 1:51:03) When I let an episode play uninterrupted, it will play until the exact time listed in iTunes and then it will end and the episode will be removed from the queue even though it has not reached the end of the listed run time. If I pause an episode and then resume play, the audio will not begin from the spot where I paused it and will jump back to near the beginning. It seems as though something is getting corrupted with the run times because the audio quality is fine but I'm not sure why the issues are happening. Here are some further details: My Device: Samsung Galaxy S5, Android Version 5.1.1 Podcast URL: http://thecity.org/feeds/audio Any help would be appreciated.

		Currently, the latest available version of AP on F-Droid is version 1.3.1 while the latest available version on Google Play is 1.3.4 I guess that's not that big of an issue, but it would be great if from 1.4 onwards the two could be in sync again. On the wiki page for AP on F-Droid it says that versions 1.2 and 1.3.4 couldn't be built: We can't build this version: The build for this version was manually disabled. Reason: requires java1.8 Is this something we can resolve? Or would it require action on the side of F-Droid?

			<description>
		For the Last 2 months or so, most of my podcasts will repeat approx the last 5 mins of the episode. So let's say a podcast is reported by AP to be 40 mins, the podcast might only be 38 mins long but will have the last 2 mins repeated. I suspect this may be related to either pausing or skipping forward in episodes as shorter episodes do not do this. I usually skip adverts, and longer episodes i may not listen to in one go. However, I have also had intermittent problems with skipping lately as well, where skipping forward will sometimes take me back to where I started skipping from (eg I skip at the start of an advert, it tkaes me forward to half way so I skip again and I end up at where I started skipping). My current device is HTC M8 running 5.0.1. I am on the beta program and have the latest version.

		It would be useful to add a skip forward button to the notification tray control. This would make it easier to skip the end of podcasts and/or adverts breaks, rather than having to unlock, open AP, navigate to the player and skip.

		Apart from my name not being in the developers or translators list (I think I am in dev branch), there's a real issue with the 'about' screen. it's nice that the screen now follows the dark theme yet upon every first scrolling after opening there is black flickering overlaying the grey background (once the whole page has been scrolled through, the black flickering stops; after moving away from the screen by opening the contributors list or by going to another app in Android, it flickers again until the first scrollthrough) my Android 'back' button doesn't work (goes to top of/refreshes the page) swiping from left to retrieve the menu doesn't work so now basically I'm stuck in the about screen until closing the app

		📱 Droid Maxx, Android 4.4.4 This happens when attempting to download episodes of two of my favorite tech podcasts. Podcasts that have this error (both are from DevChat.TV): http://feeds.feedwrench.com/TheFreelancersShow.rss http://feeds.feedwrench.com/JavaScriptJabber.rss I can see the errors in the log section, but I haven't figured out where to find the log file yet. I'm wondering: What might I be able to do to work around this issue? If this is a bug in the podcast feed, what should I tell to the feed owners to fix this? I couldn't figure out whether this is the same issue as #1086. Sorry if it's a duplicate.

		Not sure if this is by design or not. Curiously, it has worked as play for me exactly once. It was at the same time as a different bug with the same headset[1], so I discounted it. 1: That one is on Touchwiz not you. Two devices can connect to the headset at once, and every once in a while Android responds by switching its audio feed to the speaker without changing anything on the UI)

		Version 1.3.4.1 Commit: a083a0c I am having an issue where playing (and seeking through) several episodes of the Monstercat podcast does not work. I think it may have something to do with the media files, since MX Player also crashes, but Google Music does not, and it also works perfectly on the iPhone podcast app. Particularly episode 81 causes crashes. I have redownloaded the media files, but the problem persists. There is no problem playing any other podcast on my device. I am wondering if anyone else sees this same problem. If I can turn on error reporting somehow, I would post a log.

		Comparing the list of languages translated to this Transifex import list (if that indeed is what it is), it seems that Norwegian Bokmål (Norway) // 99% // Nov 01, 04:03p.m. // [nb_NO] is fully translated but not imported from Transifex. Bokmål ([ˈbuːkmɔːl], literally &quot;book tongue&quot;) is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90%[2] of the population in Norway. (Wikipedia) Given the above, I assume [nb_NO] strings could also be used to cover [no].

			<description>
		Following the discussion in #1369 and earlier thoughts, I would like to propose a translation threshold for including languages in the app. If a language has less than that threshold translated (the 'English' resource, not considering the description or changelog), then we shouldn't provide it in the app. This would create a cleaner interface in the app itself. But it also relates to the question of claiming which languages you support in Google play, maybe later on the website as well: if you have just 50% translated, than it wouldn't be fair to claim that language is supported. Though a bit arbitrarily, I would suggest a threshold of 75%. This would cut off the following languages: Hebrew (Israel) 74% [he_IL] Russian (Russia) 74% [ru_RU] Polish (Poland) 68% [pl_PL] Danish 68% [da] Portuguese (Brazil) 62% [pt_BR] Greek 59% [el] NOTE: Greek is currently not imported from Transifex either Hindi (India) 52% [hi_IN] Italian 49% [it] NOTE: Italian (Italy) // 85% // Nov 01, 04:03p.m. // [it_IT] is available, so it_IT can be used for it Romanian (Romania) 44% [ro_RO] Azerbaijani 38% [az] Spanish (Spain) 35% [es_ES] NOTE: Spanish // 100% // Nov 03, 05:03p.m. // [es] is available, so escan be used for es_ES and other languages with less than 35% of the strings translated I put the languages that will be available on the wiki: Supported languages I would be willing to spend some time activating people to update the languages that are just below the threshold.

		Hello! I had to reset my factory smartphone and am now struggling to get AntennaPod back to the previous status, which I had saved by syncing the /data/de.danieloeh.antennapod/files/folder. I synced it back, but neither AntennaPod 1.3.4.1, nor 1.4.0_rc10 and 11 recognise the files that are already present in its new data folder. Adding new subscriptions works fine, but what can I do to get the old subscriptions, downloads and playback status back? Thanks for any advice! PS: And in order to prevent the same problem in the future: Is the cache folder required in the backup, or other locations as well? Can the playback queue be backed-up?

		Since the 1.4.0.12 update, reordering episodes in my queue exhibits strange behavior. Suppose I have 5 episodes in order: A B C D E and I want to move 'A' to the end of the queue. I tap the squares on the left, and drag it down. The episodes wiggle back and forth and maybe half the time A ends up at the end. Sometimes it ends up in the middle, sometimes it moved down one spot. Sometimes I get a queue like this: B E A C D That's the actual order I ended up with just now on my phone, trying to drag A to the end. Also, this may be unrelated, but if I turn off the display, sometimes the queue is scrolled back to the top when I turn the screen back on. I'm not sure yet exactly what triggers it, but it'd be nice if it stayed where I was previously. Just now, I tried it 10 times, got bumped back to the top of the queue 7 out of the 10. I love the product, but this feels less polished than the previous release. If any other information would help diagnose the issue, I'm happy to help. I am on a Nexus 4 with android 5.1.1.

Is there a fix? I'm using a Moto G LTE with Android 4.4.4 best regards Jürgen

		I ran into some problems when trying to replay an episode that I just finished playing. As soon as the episode finishes playing, its entry in the episode list becomes &quot;grayed out&quot;, and there's no way to play it again: the &quot;play&quot; icon is actually stuck in the &quot;pause&quot; state, and the time navigation bar is unresponsive. Please note that the &quot;Auto delete&quot; setting is off (and I can see the downloaded file is still in the media folder). If I close antennapod, open it again and try to play the episode (which is still grayed out): sometimes the app still behaves as described above sometimes the app crashes when I click on the episode (&quot;Unfortunately antennapod has stopped&quot;). sometimes I can replay the episode by long pressing on it and selecting &quot;Reset playback position&quot;, but then there is no way to control playback (pause, seek, stop), and playback goes on even if I close or kill the application! I'm using version 1.4.0.12 from the f-droid repository, on android 4.2.2

When I press the refresh arrow, the arrow icon continues to &quot;circle&quot; and only stops when the phone goes into sleep mode (after which the new episodes are loaded). It used to be a fast process and I never had any problems before this update. I love this app - any help resolving this issue would be much appreciated.

		There currently is no way to find out current interval/time settings. If I set an interval value for updating before, I would expect that specific radio button to be on. (i.e. I set the interval to 12 hours, go again through interval/time introduction and re-open interval setting screen, i expect that one to be 'on') Also, the interval setting screen closes almost immediately after selecting an interval. The only feedback to the user is the highlighted button, but that's probably (at least in my case) below the user's finger and invisible. Maybe the whole row should be highlighted, or the window should close with a bit of a delay.

		Using AntennaPod in Dutch, some of the tab/button labels are cut off (for buttons) or characters are put on a next line (for tabs) because the strings are too long (due to the way our language works). Would it be possible to build in some mechanism for automatic line ending (for labels)? Shouldn't tab sizes (width) auto-adept to label length?

		App version: 1.4.2.2 Android version: 4.4.4 Device model: HTC one M8 Expected behaviour: When opening a podcast feed (the list of total available episodes for an individual podcast) and manually refreshing via the refresh icon, the new episode should show up in this list after the refresh process has finished. Current behaviour: When opening a podcast feed (the list of total available episodes for an individual podcast) and manually refreshing via the refresh icon, the new episode does not show up in this list, initially. Only after some triggering event (such as selecting another podcast, selecting an individual podcast episode, selecting the Queue) and then returning to the podcast feed, does the new episode display in the podcast feed. Note: This issue is just for the podcast feeds. The new episodes in the Episodes list display right away after manually refreshing (they do not need some triggering event to display). First occurred: After the update to Version 1.4.2.2 (I believe this issue was described by Virhub in the closed thread #1483 after the update to 1.4.2.2)

		Hi, I'm using AntennaPod 1.4.2.2 on CyanogenMod 13 (Android 6). Since I upgraded to Android 6 (with factory reset) I cannot seek a time position in the audio anymore. This also means I cannot pause the playback because the title will start from the beginning, again. A short pause leaving the app active will work, though. I tried the Sonic Media Player, Prestissimo and the vanilla after reinstalling the App.

		In 1.5.0.2 alpha we got a nice audio player redesign but I feel there is a problem with play controls. In #1561 screenshot it looks like play control bar is still the same size as previous design but it's not actually true : Play controls are too close to time bar making it more difficult not clicking by error on time bar. Besides if you compare with screenshots in #1561 you can also notice there is more space above podcast name and below episode name. (Maybe it's normal since podcast image is smaller in my screenshot)

			<description>
		When you do an OPML export, it gets saved in the antennapod folder, which gets deleted if you uninstall it. This is rather unfortunate, as keeping the data even though you're uninstalling the app is rather the point of the OPML export. Could this be changed so it either saves it in someplace which doesn't get deleted, or doesn't delete that specific file when uninstalling? As a secondary concern, doing two exports results in only one file. Does it get overwritten? I suggest saving it with timestamps in the name or just numbering them. Thirdly, maybe you should by default leave some settings and subscription data behind when uninstalling? You make it far too easy to lose all settings and subscriptions. Sincerely, A quite grumpy settingless and subscriptionless user Nexus 5 | AP v.1.5.0.2 | Android 6.0.1

Current behavior: in Queue, slide episode to right to mark as played the little message at bottom correctly says the episode has been marked as played, and there is an undo button but the episode gets back in the list to really mark as played, i need to slide the episode again, or navigate away from the Queue and back to it the &quot;undo&quot; button doesn't work as well First occurred: Version 1.5.0.9 Steps to reproduce: Choose Queue Make sure queue is &quot;unlocked&quot; Slide from left to right on any Episode It displays the little message indicating that the episode has been marked as played. Episode re-appears back in the list To really remove the episode from the list, do one of 2 things: Slide the Episode again OR Go to different view (another list or open an episode), then go back to the Queue view If this is not clear yet let me know and i'll shoot a video, i also answered the questions above about the version and rom.

		In the 'PodDBAdapter.java', I see we have listed all the table field names as constants grouped together. It is very hard to understand the DB structure in this way. Wouldn't it be great if we group these so that by reading the code itself, I can imagine the database? To implement this, we could create a static final class which we call PodDBContracts.java. In this file, corresponding to each table, we can create a static inner class which will have that table's field as constant strings. It would make the code more readable and maintainable. Please let me know if this is a welcome contribution right now. I would be happy to send a PR! Thanks, Harshita

		Provided test build, ChromeCast Audio, FP2, Android 5.1 when casting, opening the casting dialog and setting the volume via touch interface (swiping on screen) to the maximum value (or 'beyond'): volume bar gets reset to previous volume while the volume actually stays on the maximum (this problem does not exist when using the phone's hardware buttons). Also after closing and reopening the dialog, the wrong volume indication is maintained; the volume indication seems only to be corrected if another episode gets played (at least not upon seek) [https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/1879#issuecomment-211997875] this one can be annoying, but it's not implemented by me. Could be solved in the future, but has the lowest priority in my perspective. [https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/1879#issuecomment-215328484]

What fixes it: On the settings&gt;lock screen buttons, setting any combination of three buttons (e.g. rewind, pause/play, and fast-forward), generates normal behaviour. Or Disabling moto display. The issue here is with the amount of buttons on lock screen, if theres one or two, the problem is present. Steps to reproduce: Install Moto app Enable screen notifications (Moto display) Start any playback. Environment: Everything on default. Stacktrace/Logcat: I can provide the complete file if needed, but the main issue is caused by the D.MDNotificationListen. 08-22 13:33:08.221 32549-32549/?

		I subscribe to a daily podcast that has each episode of about 140 MB. I had previously requested to have an option to keep only one episode as minimum but it was rejected and the minimum number of episodes to keep is 5. I have enabled the option to delete an episode when it has finished but quite often I don't have the time to watch the podcast on a daily basis. Consequently I see the exclamation mark next to Download every few days and the automatic download stops. I have to manually delete the last 3-4 episodes before the automatic download process restores. The only &quot;cache&quot; option i see in settings is for image setting which I have set to max, 500 MB. Can you please propose a solution to the frequent overloading of the cache? Thank you for a great app!

		If I listen to an episode and it ends, AntennaPod stops playing. Looking at the &quot;Recently played&quot; list, there is the episode that just ended, PLUS the episode that was below it in the queue, even though that one was obviously not played. Expected behavior: Just add episodes that have actually been started (by manually tapping the play icon or by the auto-play feature) Use-case: I delete played episodes after some time (when I'm sure I don't need them anymore). When doing this, I just scroll through the &quot;Recently played&quot; list. It is quite confusing that nearly every second episode appearing there has never been played.

		App version: 1.6.1.2 (from F-Droid) Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Nexus 6 Expected behaviour: Pause, Jump Forward (30 s), Playback Speed buttons in the 'Now Playing' window and notification window do their intended function Current behaviour: The jump forward button work from one to a dozen times and then stops working, additionally the pause button stops working. This means if the audio is playing I need to Force Stop the app. The buttons do give the animation effect that they are being pressed when I tap them even though they do not work. First occured: At least 3 months ago, I believe even longer. Steps to reproduce: Open app Press play beside an item in the queue Press the jump forward button 1-12 times None of these buttons (jump forward, pause) work anymore Note that it seems I can pause and play the podcast many times and that it is only the jump forward button that causes this problem. I have tried multiple podcasts that all have this effect. I am not sure if it is related, but the playback speed should change when I tap it but it does not. When I long press it, I can see I have selected the speeds I want but tapping it does not cycle through them. Environment: Nothing special Thanks!

		App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 4.1.2 Device model: Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 GT-I8160 (UK) Expected behaviour: When a new episode is published, AntennaPod checks a configuration element to see whether it should be added to the play &quot;Queue&quot;. Only add to the play queue if this option is enabled, otherwise perform other configured actions, e.g. download but do not add to play queue. Current behaviour: All new (downloaded?) episodes are added to the play queue. Justification for feature request: I have a wide range of podcasts that are configured to automatically download new episodes as they are published. When I decide to listen to podcasts, I want to chose the episodes that I want to listen to which may not necessarily be all the podcasts downloaded, e.g. I may want to listen to some comedy on my walk to the station in the morning but a drama on the train journey home in the evening. I want to define the play list for my listening manually. Proposed implementation: I suggest a global Boolean configuration element, &quot;Automatically add to play queue&quot;. This could be asserted by default to retain current behaviour, i.e. not change default behaviour of application. It may be advantageous to add a per-subscription option to override the global setting but I think the global setting is required. (My preferred workflow is to have no podcasts added to the play queue by default.) This setting may best be placed in the &quot;QUEUE&quot; section of the settings menu. (The settings menu is rather long so it may prove advantageous to add a sub-menu for queue management but that is not the subject of the feature request.)

		Hi AntennaPod team, Problem: Bluetooth crashes as soon as I press play. &quot;Unfortunately, Bluetooth has stopped.&quot; Behavior still occurs when Bluetooth is just on and not connected to any other device. If I close the app and restart, the problem occurs again. If I restart the phone, the problem still occurs again. I have (multiple times) cleared cache and data for the Bluetooth app and tried again, and the behavior still occurs. This behavior is limited to AntennaPod. Bluetooth does not crash during operation of other audio player apps such as Poweramp or stock music app. Expected: Bluetooth does not crash when I press play. (The occasional Bluetooth crash is expected, but I do not expect it to crash every time I press play in AntennaPod.) First occured: About 3 months ago. Has occurred since, every time I enable Bluetooth and press play. Steps to reproduce: Turn on Bluetooth Open up AntennaPod Select a podcast and press play Bluetooth crashes &quot;Unfortunately, Bluetooth has stopped.&quot; Also occurs if AntennaPod is opened before Bluetooth is turned on, or if Bluetooth is turned on while podcast is playing. App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 4.4.2 Device model: LG G3 D855 Environment: Sonic media player enabled, no Presstissimo.

		I like to change the playback speed according to the language of the podcast. If each podcast maintained its own playback speed then I wouldn't have to keep changing the speed as the queue progresses.

		The filter icon on the feed item page looks more like a sort icon. I just had to search a minute to find out why the podcast has &quot;Filtered&quot; written on top of it (it was not filtered, but adding and removing a filter removed the message). So I think the filter icon should be easier to recognize as such.

		If the download service is killed by Android or a taskmanager, restarting the download creates a second file. The old one stays in the media folder without any reference in the database. As suggested by mfietz, the downloaded field in the DB should be expanded to allow persisting the state of started downloads. ❤️ 1

		Hi, i am using AntennaPod on my phone since several month. While running vanialla (moto-version) Android 6.x it was stable and worked as expected - as a result i really love this application as it covers whatever i need from a podcast app. Since upgrading to Android 7.x (Lineage) i got the impression that AntennaPod is running pretty unstable for me. I found similar problem reports in the Google Play comments concerning Antennapod stability issues on Android 7. Some crash examples: App is crashing while downloading new episodes App is crashing while playing Crashes might happen in different styles: App is silently closed (usually when display is off) App is crashing showing an Android dialog that antennapod was closed offering option to reopen it or ignore until next boot (usually when display is on/active while crash happens) App is crashing as part of a soft-reboot of the device (usually when playing and display is off) To get a better impression about the run-times between crashes i'll add an example/excerpt of my today crashes Example crash history 16:58 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 16:59 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 17:00 - App closed silenty while playing with display off I was wondering if it changes if i do have the display running/on - so i kept using the phone for the following minutes 17:07 - App closed with OS crash dialog while display was on 17:12 - App closed with OS crash dialog while display was on Back to having display off 17:18 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 17:19 - App closed silenty while playing with display off 17:20 - App closed silenty while playing with display off App version: 1.6.2.3 (from Google Play) Android version: 7.1.2 [Lineage] Devide model: Moto G 2015 - Osprey Expected behaviour: Antennapod should play episodes without crashing Current behaviour: Antennapod is crashing First occured: According to my impression it started since Android 7.x Steps to reproduce: Hard to tell, usually i am really just listening to something having the display off. Environment: Episodes are stored on external sd card (tried 2 different cards so far) Stacktrace/Logcat: I do have a logcat output of this crashes mentioned above, please tell me if you want the full, or just :W, :E or :F to reduce the logcat clutter. I would love to offer any additional information needed and help as far as i can. Please let me know whatelse might help you.

		App version: 1.6.2.3 Android version: 7.1.1 -- Lineage OS (latest) Devide model: Moto E 2015 Surnia Expected behaviour: The number next to &quot;Episodes&quot; in the side bar should match the number of new episodes in the scroll area. Current behaviour: The number next to &quot;Episodes&quot; is always one more than the number that are visible. When no episodes are available, it still shows &quot;1&quot;. Steps to reproduce: I just upgraded from CyanogenMod to Lineage by reflashing the device (not an inplace upgrade). After installing AntennaPod, I restored its files from a backup with adb and set the permissions/SELinux context. Everything works fine other than this episode count is wrong. Is there any way to get AntennaPod to reset this count? Or does this number indicate something else is wrong? When I store the podcast files on an external SD card. When I first started AntennaPod after restoring its files, it started to download new episodes before it had permission to write to the SD card. I deleted those episodes (in the app) and then downloaded them again after granting permission. I don't know if this could somehow be related -- maybe it thinks there is an episode in internal storage still?

		I have six podcasts already subscribed without problems. When attempting to subscribe to The Guardian's Brexit Means..., I got a message in Antennapod's download log saying &quot;IO Error: open failed: EINVAL (Invalid argument)&quot;. The message did not specify which file name it complained about. The only bug looking vaguely relevant I found was #268, but that's supposed to be solved, and the podcast's name doesn't contain a colon. However, it does contain an apostrophe, which may or may not be legal in FAT32. Sure enough, if I change Antennapod's storage to internal I can subscribe to the podcast. App version: 1.6.2.3 (from F-Droid) Android version: 6.0.1 (Fairphone Open 17.07.6, not rooted, without Google services) Device model: Fairphone 2 Expected behaviour: The podcast should be subscribed, no matter the storage back-end Antennapod uses. Current behaviour: If storage is a FAT32 external SD card, the podcast is not subscribed, and a message saying &quot;IO Error: open failed: EINVAL (Invalid argument)&quot; appears in the download log. First occured: Version 1.6.2.3 was already installed the first time I tried, on August 5, 2017. Steps to reproduce: Go to Settings -&gt; Choose Data Folder. Select your external SD card, formatted with FAT32 (e.g. /storage/1234-ABCD/). Go to Subscriptions -&gt; Add Podcast. Enter https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/brexit-means/podcast.xml in &quot;Add Podcast by URL&quot; 4.1. Alternatively, click &quot;Search FYYD&quot;, enter guardian brexit and click the first result. Click &quot;Subscribe&quot;. Environment: Auto Download is enabled on WiFi. When Antennapod is configured to use the external FAT32 SD card, the download fails. When Antennapod is configured to use internal storage, it succeeds.

		App version: 1.6.3.0 (from Google Play) Commit: b1bb29d Android version: 7.1.1 Device model: Lenovo Moto Z Expected behaviour: Continuous audio output when playing several items from playback list. Current behaviour: When using a Jaybird Freedom headset, most of the time when AntennaPod skips to the next podcast in the playback list, the audio output is silenced though the podcast is played. You have to pause and restart playback in the app to unsilence the audio output. Pausing and restarting with the buttons of the bluetooth headset doesn't solve the problem. Using a MPow Bluetooth receiver does not show this behaviour. Steps to reproduce: Connect the Jaybird Freedom Headset Play podcast When AntennaPod skips to the next item most of the time it silences the output. Pausing and unpausing in the app resolves the issue. Environment: Jaybird Freedom Headset various playback speeds (1.75 up to 3.0) Sonic Media Player Headset disconnection/reconnection enabled Bluetooth reconnection enabled pause on interruption restart after call

If try to play one sound from the feed, it fails too, and the app just hangs there and will not play sounds from the normal feeds. In fact, the play interface won't react to any operation, so i think feeds from ximalaya is something like poison. If I want to make the app wake up and play sounds from the normal feeds, such as the following, http://feeds.podtrac.com/zKq6WZZLTlbM, I must clear the data of it from the app manager.

		Take a look at this screenshot from searching iTunes for &quot;romance&quot;: I expect that one feed for this search term (&quot;romance&quot;) today is missing a feedUrl field. This should not block all the other presumably valid feeds from displaying. App version: 1.x (from Google Play/F-Droid/Custom build) Android version: 8.0 Device model: Pixel Expected behaviour: shows

		Ever since the Android 8 update I've had podcasts suddenly start playing for no reason. On one occasion it started in the middle of the night. On another I went back to the room where I left my phone and found it merrily playing away. I think it might have been on charge on both occasions, but not just put on. Twice it's happened while I've been reading a book in the Kindle app. My sleeping wife was not amused! Strangely, it seems to start at the beginning of a podcast, not where I last left off. The resume on headphones/Bluetooth feature still gets that right.

		App version: 1.6.4.1 Android version: 7.1.2 LineageOS build 14.1-20171023-NIGHTLY-d801 Nova Launcher for home screen Bug also exists using the default Trebuchet launcher Device model: LG G2 Expected behaviour: Text color is easy to read on the grey widget background The podcast name is shown. In the attached screenshot, you can also see a weather widget and another podcast player widget. Both provide transparency, have white text and are easier to read. Ideally provide the user with a way to customize the widget colors / transparency as other widgets do Current behaviour: Details text is in black which is hard to read against the grey background. There is less contrast on the actual screen than in the screenshot. The widget background and text stay the same regardless of wallpaper. The name of the podcast isn't shown. First occurred: Immediately on installation of AntennaPod today Steps to reproduce: Install AntennaPod Long press the screen to add a widget and select the AntennaPod widget

		Hi, I try to make a PR for support Android O and this sucks Why do you have a 'core' module with same flavors ? In our company we merged the modules (and if you want you can separate it with packages) and the result was a easier build script and faster build times. If you like a merge of modules, I can make a PR and add support Android O too. Please let me know ! PS: I just ask to save my time, because a lot of open source projects are not very open to new ideas.

		I have the Nexus 5X running Android 8.0 and antennaPod 1.6.4.1 . Did a factory reset and only have a couple other non factory apps installed. First let me say I tried all the podcast players out there and this was by far the best. I really loved this program until recent and wish I hadn't updated to android 8. Today it just got so bad I couldn't take it anymore thats why I'm opening a bug report. So many problems I don't know where to start. 1 Randomly just starts playing when plugging into the charger Randomly starts playing if I let call go unanswered while plugged in to charger Randomly starts playing after using the camera and then turning screen off and putting in pocket. 2 Sometimes starts up playing multiple pod casts at the same time including the last podcast I listened to thats marked as played and shows download only. Update - Today when it began to play on its own I discovered that it was playing the same episode over top of itself. The episode began simultaneously playing from where I left off and also from the very beginning. How can that even happen? 3 Today it just started playing when I turned the display off and I couldn't shut it off. None of the playback control buttons would respond and it continued to play even after I closed all programs. I had to open up android settings, all apps, and manually stop antenna pod to get it to shut down. 4 Sometimes when restarting an paused episode the playback will start completely over at the very beginning instead of where I left off. 5 This problem has me even more confused because I'm not sure whats to blame. The same podcasts I been getting from Itunes using the same unchanged home network take much longer to download. A podcast that use to take 2 min now takes 30 minutes. Very frustrating. 👍 2

		It would be nice to have an option to Archive Podcasts. Archiving a podcast would mean there won't be any more updates and the podcast would be moved to a different section than the Subscriptions. This way, a dead podcast or a podcast that is uninteresting at the moment would be both stopped and the user will not lose the read status, the place where a certain episode was stopped, the list of favorites, and so on.

		App version: 1.6.4.2 from Google Play Android version: 6.0 Device model: Huawei P8 lite (ALE-L21) Expected behaviour: Play any podcast episode Current behaviour: AntennaPod freezes or just does nothing. First occured: 1.6.4.2 Steps to reproduce: Play any podcast episode Environment: Tried with headphones, with internal speaker and bluetooth. Tried with Sonic Media Player and without. Tried with different speeds. All changes had no effect. Last system update for the Huawei was done about a week ago. I can not verify if the system update or the app update caused the problem. Stacktrace/Logcat: No stacktrace available Please let me know how to help you with this. AntennaPod worked fine a week ago on that device.

		Hello, I've got a recurring problem I can't seem to find anything about, though I might not know what I'm looking for. The app runs fine and I love it, but I keep getting a failed download error and I have no idea where it's coming from. The error is 'unsupported Feed Type: Invalid type' and the podcast listed is http://rmc.fr I have no idea what that is or how to get rid of it. From a Google search it looks like a sport talk radio show or some such. I just want it to stop trying to download whatever this is but can't figure out where or what it is. Could be a virus for all I know. If I'm missing any information, please just ask. Be aware I'm only moderately technically proficient so I might have to ask a lot of questions. Any help in fixing this issue would be great appreciated or even an idea about what is going on. Thank you for your time and consideration. App version: 1.6.4.2 Android version: 6.0.1 Device model: Honor 5x running EMUI 4.0 Expected behaviour: Current behaviour: First occurred: It's been happening for months and I'm just now getting around to trying to fix it. It's been a busy year and this is a very minor annoyance. Steps to reproduce: It does this on it's own when it updates my podcasts which I have set for every 8 hours. Environment: It's set to only download podcasts on WiFi. All my podcasts are set to auto download the newest episodes.
