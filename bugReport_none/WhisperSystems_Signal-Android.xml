			<description>
		While performing a license analysis on the source code I found a conflicting EULA in res/raw/eula. It has problematic areas, like the software is only available for non-commercial use, and some of the terms are probably considered a &quot;further restriction&quot; under the GPL. My hope is that this file was just overlooked and wasn't supposed to have been included in the distribution.

			<description>
		The current default for TextSecure is to display the keyboard when you go to view an SMS. This takes up a lot of screen real estate and makes reading the messages a little more difficult than it should be. This is down to the text area being in focus when you go to read a message The ideal solution to this would be not to defailt to having the text entry area in focus and instead let the end user decide whether they need to type a response and in which case the keyboard will open.

		(email addresses changed to prevent spam and whatnot) Steps to recreate: long click a message click 'Forward message' type in email address in the 'To' text box : a@aaa.aa Click 'Send' When I type in aaa@aaa.aa it works great. When I type in a@aaa.aa, I receive the toast error 'Recipient is not a valid SMS or email address!' When I forward to the 'a@aaa.aa' address using the android built in text message program, I can send the message fine, and when I send it from TextSecure, it goes to aaa@aaa.aa perfectly. So, I don't believe it to be an issue with the OS or the email function of TextSecure. The problem seems to be in line 8 of src\org\thoughtcrime\securesms\util\NumberUtil.java The regex, ^\w-+[\w]+@([\w-]+.)+[A-Z]{2,4}$, seems to be requiring three letters for the left side of the email. I think this is in contradiction of RFC5322 (page 17) and real email addresses in use today.

However once my phone rebooted I received the normal text messaging app went off and the text was routed there. However because it was encrypted with my key it just appeared as a bunch of ciphertext.

			<description>
		When launching TextSecure for the first time, it allows one to import the standard SMS database. However, this process can take quite a long time (tried with 3000+ SMS). The screen has the time to turns off, and when you turn it on again, TextSecure asks again if you want to import the standard SMS database. If you say &quot;Yes&quot; again, a lot of messages are duplicated… The easiest fix would be to inhibate the screen saver, but it wouldn't handle more complex cases (such as the user launching another program while TextSecure is processing the SMS)

			<description>
		When TextSecure's passphrase is not cached, although the conversations are encrypted, it is still possible for anyone to read the names of the message recipients. This may be enough to incriminate an individual, and it certainly enables adversaries to easily discern the contact details of the individuals to whom I have been sending encrypted messages. I'd like to see TextSecure enable encryption for all details not only message content, assuming this is possible?

			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		Its not exactly a number one priority, but... When the &quot;Include whitespace tag&quot; is used it adds a white-space at the end of non-encrypted messages like it says it does. This is fine until your in an area with fluctuating signal, because when a message doesn't send it still adds the white-space and if you copy the message in one of two ways, it still has a white-space and duplicates it at the end of the message and can cause the message not to display correctly. The two ways in concern are... The click and hold on a message to copy it. The clicking on a message to put it in the message box. This is easily fixed by disabling the feature, but if the feature is there and can be fixed up to be better why not. Possible solution could be a resend button for when it fails or even a check for a white space before adding one.

		While TextSecure is running, it shows a notification to indicate that the passphrase is cached. There is no way to dismiss this notification while the key is cached... this is good. My feature request is that it should be possible to dismiss this notification, and have TextSecure automatically clear the passphrase when it is dismissed. This will make a much quicker way to clear the cached key, and take far fewer steps in order to do it.

		My friends have informed me that they've been spammed with texts from my phone. Evidently TextSecure has a bit of a history of occasionally resending SMS without user input so I'm frankly not surprised by this report. I wanted to file a bug report so it can be fixed. Let me know if you need any logs or diagnostic reports. Based on the changelog I think someone probably has a good idea what causes this problem.

		It would be a great feature to allow threads to automatically be pruned to a user specified length. Basically allow the user to set an option that when a thread exceeds X number of text messages, delete the oldest to keep the length at X. Also it would be great if I could protect messages so they are not automatically deleted. Thanks

		On my girlfriends Android she gets a NullPointerException on ECDHBasicAgreement.java:41 when she is trying to decrypt the messages. The crash only occurs if she gets the &quot;right&quot; password, otherwise it states &quot;wrong passphrase&quot;. We have sent in a crash report on this, but I am eager for a fix since she is at the moment unable to read SMS messeges she has already rescived.

What could have happened? What can I try to get them back? Should I try re-importing them from SD card? Using Samsung Galaxy S (GT-I9000) with firmware 2.3.6 build no GINGERBREAD.XWJW6 with app version 0.8.5 I think (at least Google Play tells me it is up to date)

		Just wondering, has TextSecure somehow deliberately disabled screenshots?

I am able to screenshot the native Messaging app and the home page and so on. This is using the Power+Home button combination.

		When unlocking the TextSecure DB you are prompted for a password, if a user gets the password wrong the typed characters are left in place. This results in the user having to delete the password before retyping it, as it's too hard to figure out where the typo was in a starred out password. I would like to propose that if an incorrect password is typed the password field is blanked, thus saving users the trouble of deleting the incorrect pass.

		After the most recent update, I noticed a change in behavior with the back button. Before, hitting the back button while in a conversation thread would always return me back to the message list view. Now, hitting back will often send me to other conversation threads, often times it will send me to the SAME conversation thread I just hit back on. I believe this happens when I view messages via the status bar notification. Example: I am talking to somebody in a conversation thread then hit home. The same person messages me again, and I select the message from the status bar to view it. Then I hit back - it will take me to the exact same conversation I was just on. Then I have to hit back again to get to the message list view. When talking to many people at once this gets quite annoying. The back button on a conversation should always return to the message list! Thank you guys for the fantastic software.

Shall I try to capture some packets as I receive an MMS and post them to you? (Like last time: OS-app v TS dumps.)

I would suggest using both color and some differentiation in the symbol itself - e.g. a question mark could better indicate unverified state.

		On a Nexus One, running TextSecure (0.9.8) gets very slow when opening a conversation with 4,050 messages. It's now taking at least 6 to 10 seconds to display anything when accessing that conversation. The same delay occurs again after sending a message. Other conversations with fewer messages open quite quickly and don't experience delays after sending messages. Perhaps only the most recent messages in a conversation could be decrypted and displayed first, and the rest backfilled as time permits?

		Use of this application IMMEDIATELY renders people's communications 'interesting' to any surveillance apparatus. This is a major drawback and should more prominently discussed for the security of the user base.

		One of my Chinese contacts sent me an SMS. TextSecure doesn't appear to encode chinese characters, I can only see some binary mess. Before, I imported existing SMS's from this contact, they imported ok. Those I can decipher. My guess is that the original Message App encodes the writing well, and those were copied straight into TextSecure.

		I received a text message while TextSecure was being updated. After the update finished I opened the application and in place of the arrived message there was a grey text &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot;. This did not seem to ever finish. After forgetting the passphrase and entering it again the message was decrypted, so it wasn't lost.

		Looks like you are using 100 rounds of PKCS#5 - PBKDF2 here: private static SecretKey getKeyFromPassphrase(String passphrase, byte[] salt) { PBEKeySpec keyspec = new PBEKeySpec(passphrase.toCharArray(), salt, 100); SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;PBEWITHSHA1AND128BITAES-CBC-BC&quot;); return skf.generateSecret(keyspec); } Shouldn't this be at least 10,000?

		It would be great if TS could integrate with Androids native system password and encrypt with the screen lock pin or password so that it would not have to be entered again when launching TS. Alternatively, for those of us whose devices are already encrypted and only need TS for over the air encryption, an option to forego local encryption all together would be nice.

			<bugID>Issue #186</bugID>
			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		Is it possible to implement a solution to export encrypted TextSecure database in a form that could be (securely) opened/read outside the app? When I receive SMSes I imediately delete unimportant but keep the others. Slowly the amount of kept ones is getting higher and higher. I don't need most of them for every day usage, i don't even need them on my device, but some of them are important to me and want to be able to read them when needed. I have an app on my device that backs them up from default SMS client to xml database and automagicaly transfers it to my dropbox so I can read old SMSes on my computer whenever I want. The only problem in this scenario is that I don't like my personal stuff laying around unencrypted on clouds that belong to some corporation (I can encrypt personal or confidential emails on gmail with PGP if I want). So, could anything similar to above solution be done with TextSecure database, only in an encrypted form (maybe PGP encrypted) in a way as simple as possible? It's not really nice experience to browse hundreds of old SMSes on a mobile phone.

		Currently, if you receive a message from an unknown phone number there's no good way to associate it with an entry in the phone's address book. Even when viewing SMS details, users cannot copy and paste the number, so they end up having to add it manually. It would be nice if there was a feature similar to &quot;Add to contacts&quot; that exists in the default messaging app. Until then, I found a workaround that's not intuitive, but gets the job done: Press the call button so that it opens the number in the Phone app From there, press the physical Menu button and select &quot;Add to contacts&quot;

Any suggestions on how to resolve this would be appreciated. ** Just an update. I tried this again. Not sure what changed, but it shows connecting to MMS server. Sat there a little while, I noticed it flash decrypting.. and then got the unsupported Encoding error.. Happened twice, so i'm gonna guess its a software issue. Again, any suggestions to get this going would be great.

I clicked the option to verify and received an SMS from Google stating &quot;Your Google verification code is _NCCiEA5qvy&quot;. I assume this is supposed to be some sort of hyperlinked URL that I am supposed to click on, yet TextSecure is only showing it to me as text so I am unable to click on it in order to verify my number with Google.

		I tried doing some quick research of how TextSecure is doing authentication. At the moment my impression that it's not but just assumes there are no MITM and stores the keys for verification at a later point. I guess this a very convenient and reasonable default. However, it would be nice if I could &quot;strongly authenticate&quot; my contacts which would indicate I have verified the keys in person and trust them. This could (should IMO) also be rewarded by adding some visual indicator in the UI. (maybe a better solution is to reverse the process and show an indicator it a contact is not authenticated).

		....if and only if android storage encryption is enabled. I have encrypted my phone storage using the built in phone storage encryption (dm-crypt). I would see it as a nice addition to be able to disable the built in app encryption, thus avoiding being asked for a passphrase, if phone storage encryption is active. I also find the &quot;cached passphrase&quot; a bit annoying which could be omitted in this case. Unless you see any issues with this approach I may find some time to help implementing it in the future. More information https://source.android.com/tech/security/ http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html https://source.android.com/tech/encryption/android_crypto_implementation.html Potential problems I'm not familiar with the device administration API but it may be necessary to require the BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN permission. But I don't think so I'm not sure how android/dm-crypt manages the keys when the phone is on, but locked

		I am not sure if this is due to my operator or the TextSecure application but I thought I'd mention it here either way. Every time I receive a MMS I get another copy of the exact same MMS four days later. This happens from different people with different phones, so it seems unlikley that the issue is on their side. My spontaneous though was that maybe TextSecure doesn't mark the MMS as read properly on the server and thus I get another version of it. I am using vanilla Android 4.2.1 on a Galaxy Nexus phone. I just upgraded to the latest version, so I have been using version 0.9.9.6 of TextSecure.

		I use a Samsung Ace, which has very little internal memory and Android 2.3.6. But it tells me, i still have 23 MB left. Everytime I try to update to a new TextSecure version, it fails because of too little memory, but it can update other apps. Uninstall and Reinstall works, but then I loose my chat history. Do you have any idea, why this is happening and what to do?

		EDIT: This issue is not a bug in TextSecure, but appears to be a Cyanogenmod problem. MMS does work with a correctly spelled Fallback MMSC. Please close this one. Sorry. _ORIGINAL MESSAGE FOLLOWS_ Since switching to an AOSP-based ROM (CM 10.1), trying to &quot;Add Attachment&quot; to a message brings up a screen that explains that APN data is not available, and requesting MMSC information. However, even after filling in the correct URL, sending MMS fails every time. Logcat includes: E/DatabaseUtils( 1698): java.lang.SecurityException: No permission to write APN settings: Neither user 10069 nor current process has android.permission.WRITE_APN_SETTINGS. I don't know why this wasn't a problem on my previous TouchWiz ROM.

		Hello textsecure team, since two updates of textsecure I can't verify recievers any more. There is no red/green checkmark any more (upper bar). If there is a TextSecure reciever on the other side, the lock on the upper bar is locked, but it just offers the possibility to verify the sender or drop the the session. If I try to verify the reciever, I get to the key screen, but there is no option anymore to do this. I just see a green lock on the sending button - but for all textsecure sessions. Same behavior if the session is/was still verified/marked as verified. I thought this might be a bug. I already tried to export my TextSecure-Data, remove the app, install again, and import my backed up data. Still the same issue I'm using Android 4.1.2 on XT890 with TextSecure in the latest version.# thanx in advance

			<description>
		Hi, I have recently tried to establish a secure session with a friend, but we both had the problem that TextSecure didn't stop sending new key exchange requests which were verified by the TextSecure instance on the other side correctly. And paying for messages that are sent automaticly every 2 minutes is not funny... ;) I might have found the problem in the code, but I'm not sure, so please take a look at the following classes and code fragments: KeyExchangeProcessor: the method 'public boolean processKeyExchangeMessage(KeyExchangeMessage message, long threadId)' is initially called by the SmsReceiver, if the received key exchange message is from a valid sender (else if (processor.isTrusted(keyExchangeMessage))) this method will send a new OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage, if 'needsResponseFromUs()' evaluates to true. private boolean needsResponseFromUs() { return !hasInitiatedSession() || remoteKeyRecord.getCurrentRemoteKey() != null; } The remoteKey is set afterwards: remoteKeyRecord.setCurrentRemoteKey(message.getPublicKey()); After that the IdentityKey of the message is set in the database for this recipient: if (message.hasIdentityKey()) {
  DatabaseFactory.getIdentityDatabase(context)
                 .saveIdentity(masterSecret, recipient, message.getIdentityKey());
}
 and the initially received KeyExchangeMessage is scheduled for decrypt: DecryptingQueue.scheduleRogueMessages(context, masterSecret, recipient); Please take a look to the DecryptingQueue.java file: The scheduled decrypt for the KeyExchangeMessage should finally land in the method 'handleKeyExchangeProcessing(String plaintxtBody)' Here the method processKeyExchangeMessage is called again, if the message has a valid IdentityKey: else if (processor.isTrusted(keyExchangeMessage)) { DatabaseFactory.getEncryptingSmsDatabase(context).markAsProcessedKeyExchange(messageId); processor.processKeyExchangeMessage(keyExchangeMessage, threadId); } Since the remoteKey is set, another OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage will be sent and the message will be scheduled again... So we have a constellation where the OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage is sent endlessly. But I'm not sure, if it's possible to get into this loop, but my experience suggests it is... The AUTO_KEY_EXCHANGE_PREF must be set to true in the preferences. I hope this description is helpful. Best regards Axel

		I want to be able to make TextSecure the default handler for only encrypted texts sent from other TextSMS users.

It seems like this could be resolved by giving SecureText an option to use the regular SMS database for unencrypted texts.. Reason #2 -- It's just not as glitzy and polished as the SMS app I usually use. If I could talk to the couple paranoid people in my life with this app and everyone else with my regular SMS app, that would great! This is a duplicate of Issue #324, which moxie0 closed after commenting, &quot;Just untick &quot;use for all SMS&quot; as well as &quot;use for all MMS&quot; in TextSecure settings.&quot; I had already tried this suggestion, and it did not work. It caused incoming key requests to go to my default SMS app. I would appreciate not being treated like a complete idiot this time.

		Please add the option to use TextSecure only for encrypted SMSs and/or MMSs sent by another person using TextSecure. This way one could use another messaging app for regular plain-text SMS/MMS and TextSecure for encrypted ones.

		Hey, on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with Jelly Beans, some messages (like 10-20%) are not received by TextSecure but by the normal message-Android-app. Those messages won't show up in TextSecure at all. TextSecure is running in the background and this happens if the encryption key is stored in the ram or not. Did someone else experience that? Cheers, Kim

		(Disclaimer: I'm not a designer.) It would be nice if the launcher icon could be updated to reflect the current Android design guidelines (see the rightmost of the three columns: Iconography | Android Developers). I imagine the green box should be a bit more three-dimensional. As an example, the BBC News, Flipboard, Nova Launcher Prime, and Google Calendar app icons are all slightly three-dimensional. Currently the icon looks out of place on Android 4+ launchers.

		I had this thought. Right now even if you stored some key information for each user you text. There is still an initial man in the middle attack. Not a big fan of the NSA/IRS right now I would like to be confident that I am having a private conversation. It would be nice if we could use some out of band way to initialize the shared key stuffs. For example if we called each other, read numbers to each other, typed in the corresponding number it would be hard for someone to insert themselves in between. Another way might be to have the cellphones present each other some sort of 2d bar code that they scan.

		Device A is running Android 4.3. (Cyanogenmod current.) SMS is being sent/received via google voice through @koush's Voice+. Device B is running Android 4.0.4/Sense 3.6. (Can't be upgraded.) Device B can send a key exchange message to Device A. It is received and processed. Device A then sends an encrypted message to Device B, but that is received as ciphertext, and not decrypted. I then cancel the secure session and send a key exchange message from Device A to Device B. The message is received as ciphertext and not decrypted and processed. So it appears that Device B running Android 4.0.4 cannot process any ciphertext, but can send a session initiation request, and then fails to handle the response. That or Device A either isn't responding properly with the response to the session initiation request, and/or isn't sending session initiation requests properly. Any idea on how I can send some debug logs for this that might help figure this out?

			<description>
		I use a password safe for all my passwords. I used the same password safe for text secure. It works pretty good, I unlock the safe, select the entry. Copy the password and paste it where I needed it. I created a new entry for TextSecure. Nice strong random string of good encryption. I pasted the password into TextSecure for the initial install. Now I flushed the in memory keys used by textsecure. When I open the application it asks me for my password. I do the same steps as before. I copy and paste the password into the field from the password safe. However textsecure does not take the password. I am guessing when I created the original password it clipped the password to a length it deemed appropriate. Unfortunately that clipped password is not my password, and now my password does not work. TextSecure should have errored out instead of using a different password. What is the character limit on textsecure? Does it clip from the front or back?

		Hi. TextSecure seems to be using something other than OTR. Rather than straight SMS, I use a jabber-to-SMS gateway, and I was hoping that the OTR on my jabber client would be compatible with TextSecure. That is not the case. Should I work on some sort of OTR compatibility mode for textsecure? Any words of guidance on this?

			<description>
		In previous versions it was possible to send a message to multiple people using plain SMS. As outlined in #347 TextSecure can nowadays send groupmessages only as MMS. It would be still good to be able to send a message to multiple people using only SMS. Not everybody (as a sender or receiver) has MMS setup or knows how MMS should be setup, so TextSecure makes it now very hard to use it as the default app for all kind of messages, if group messaging is not possible without any fiddling in the settings. -&gt; Without being able to send Groupmessages as SMS TextSecure is less likely being adopted, as it is not a straight drop-in replacement for the default messenger. Although, I believe you that implementing real group messaging in MMS is technical less a problem it should in my opinion still possible to send a simple SMS (like an invitiation) to multiple recipients using plain old SMS.

		This causes any extended notifications (gmail, media players, etc.) to always be collapsed, as they will never be first. I use Lightflow and Threema, which both force their notification to be last in the tray, avoiding interfering with other notifications.

		Hi All, Using text secure have found a bug when sending or receiving text have to put pass word in no problem after reading my text or sending text there is no log out. The phone just goes back to normal mode 5 hours later clicked on the Secure text Icon and did not need to log in again shows up every text with out logging is a Security risk. I don't knows does any one else have this problem with there own mobile phone. I think a log out button would be a good thing or log out timer that switches you out when you have not used Secure text for some time. Apart form the bug the program is excellent. Regards Anthony

		Each time my passphrase times out and I re-enter it, the same MMS message is downloaded again - it appears as though it is being re-sent. I am running Cyanogenmod 10.1, TextSecure 1.0; my carrier is Bell Canada; phone is an HTC wildfire S. In preferences, both &quot;use for all SMS&quot; and &quot;use for all MMS&quot; are enabled. Deleting the entire thread appears to have fixed the problem for now. I did not try first deleting only the first instance of the MMS message, so i don't know if that would have been sufficient.

		Ambiguous title, I understand. Consider the following situation: I'm on a train that goes both overground and underground, and it has to go through a long-winded tunnel for about 15 minutes. I send a message to X at 15:00. However, I'm in the tunnel and I have no signal, so the application returns an error as it's unable to send it. I leave the tunnel at 15:15, and the message is delivered. However, next to the message TextSecure writes 15:00, when the message was sent at 15:15. TextSecure should track when the message is actually delivered to the provider (&quot;leaves your phone&quot;) and not when you first hit the send button..

			<description>
		Before the recent update, sending an SMS to multiple recipients correctly queued an SMS to each recipient independently. Now it converts it to an MMS group conversation, which is not the desired behaviour, for me. Is it possible for this to be a configurable option? Separately, this MMS conversation required me to look up the settings and re-enter them into Text Secure. I would be more than happy to grant access for Text Secure to read my device's MMS settings, were I prompted to do so. I'm using a Nexus 4, running Android 4.3, build JWR66Y. Text Secure doesn't have an About page with a version number (which would be useful) but the Play Store (in en-GB) shows the date 21 Oct 2013 for the app, with the description talking about Changes in 1.0.2

		The sms senders are sometimes displayed wrong. That is, I know the sender of a message but that message is grouped with some one else's message Here is an example, the top line says that the SMS is from ISBANK (this is not a contact I have in my contact list, but its the name of my bank), but the message is from google's calendar application reminding me of an appointment.. Another message's header says that the SMS was from IS BANKASI (again my bank) but the message is actually a service message I received when I changed GSM providers informing me of that the settings have been sent to my phone.

		For convenience I would like to omit providing a passphrase. As I encrypt the whole device through the function provided by Android, I don't have to worry about someone reading my messages when the device is stolen. At least not more than I already have to as I always cache the passphrase. Now, there are two issues: The application tells me, that I must use a passphrase :-( Is the passphrase used to encrypt the messages? I.e. would a short passphrase compromise the security of transmitted messages? Thank you in advance!

		there's always the same problem when i suggest TextSecure to a nongeeky person: people say &quot;whooo, yes!&quot;, install application, open it, and then - when a prompt for setting the password appears - shut it down and uninstall. they're even too lazy to first set the password and later set storage encryption to off. now, i understand the meaning of storage encryption for people that are living under opressive regimes or journalists, but for a usual non-techy european that only wants it's privacy it's a bit too much. so, it would be great if people could accept storage encryption (and set password) or skip it at the very beginning at the first use of the application.

		The lock icon will always show up in the left upper-hand corner of the task bar. Threema had the same thing and it get's crowded with a few apps and there is now way to get rid of the icon when the app is running. Threema solved this by lowering the priority of the task bar item. This way there is now small icon in the upper left corner, but when the notification bar is pulled down the Threema entry is still there. I think this would be a good behaviour for TextSecure. Appear in the notification bar when pulled down, but don't stick in the upper left corner.

		Unfortunately, Hangout is now the default SMS app on Android 4.4 so I decided to install TextSecure as my alternative SMS client. However, Android doesn't recognize that TextSecure could be an alternative SMS app and I can't tell the system that it should use TextSecure instead of Hangout. As a result an income SMS is picked up by both TextSecure and Hangout and notifications of both are played.

		i noticed that when TextSecure is down and i receive an SMS, it doesn't &quot;start&quot; TextSecure and both application are thus desynchronised as upon a start of TextSecure, it does not synchronize its database with the SMS manager. The import of SMS warn that it import the whole database and may result in duplication. Some Ideas regarding this issue: never let TextSecure being stopped (like a daemon or automatically triggered upon reception of an SMS) synchronize its SMS database each time it is started so that every &quot;missed&quot; SMS is encrypted. An option to delete sms from SMS manager should also exist so that only encrypted SMS are left on the phone. I may try to code something for idea number 2.

		Not sure if this is a TextSecure issue. When in my cynagenmod OS, I get an SMS and since my TextSecure is unlocked, it shows the SMS to me in the notification list. There is an option to mark it as read. However when i mark it as read, nothing happens. Even after I remove it from my notification list by sliding the message to my right, the next time any SMS comes, it shows the old message also as unread.

		Mt Android HTC One Google edition appears to have been a victim of the Google Play services bug. I was using another app (not Text Secure) when the phone went dark then after several seconds the phone booted but many of my user preferences were lost (desktop was reset to the factory default, etc.) However my apps were all still installed and I was able to start Text Secure, enter my passphrase, and access the message threads, however the following happened: message thread contact profile photos were replaced with the generic gray &quot;human silhouette&quot; image threads contact names are now either &quot;anonymous&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; (my encrypted threads are anonymous, the other unencrypted threads are either anonymous or unknown) within an existing thread I can send a message to the correct recipient, but the message is not encrypted (the lock icon at the top is shown closed though as if the encrypted session is ongoing). What still works: passphrase I can view the messages in both encrypted and unencrypted threads. when opening threads (encrypted or not) the profile photo of the sender is shown next to each message clicking the profile photo next to any message (encrypted or not) I get the contact information for the sender. I can end the previous encrypted session (see bullet 3 above however) and initiate a new encrypted session through the normal key exchange. So it appears the the information for each message was maintained, however the information for the thread (including the key for encrypted sessions) was lost. I'm not certain there is really a Text Secure bug here since I don't believe it caused the system crash but maybe the data regarding message threads could be maintained in an improved way so that it isn't lost to a crash like this.

		When I first installed the app, I had issues with messages going to the stock messaging app despite TextSecure being set as default. That issue stopped when I disabled the stock messaging app. Now with the KitKat update, messages are going to Hangouts instead of TextSecure. I really don't want to have to disable Hangouts because I use hangouts. I see in the play store, this is a known issue. Has anyone come up with a workaround for it yet?

		It would appear that there is currently no way to delete a contact's key. If a contact decides to stop using TextSecure, it is impossible to send them unencrypted messages as long as TS has a key in its database that matches their number.

		I have Nexus 4 with Android 4.4 and tried to send a picture (with attachment, MMS). I have correct MMS settings (I also successfully received one normal, unencrypted MMS), but when I try to send a picture, TextSecure crashes. What exactly I did. I attached a picture (inside encrypted conversation (thread) with someone clicked Add attachment, added picture and no text). When I click to send, TextSecure crashes. I have to run it again, enter the passphrase to unlock it, and when I just click to a conversation thread containing that picture (which was not sent, i.e. the other party did not received it), TextSecure crashed again. I had to delete the complete conversation thread without opening it, to stop crashing... TextSecure version is 1.0.2.

		Silent SMS's are usually used for locating GSM user (when user receives SMS, location data are stored in data retention database) identifying his IMSI/TMSI number, etc. More about it here: http://matej.owca.info/predavanja/GSM_security_2012.pdf, page 39. Silent SMS are usually used together with IMSI catchers, more info here: http://secupwn.github.io/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/ The problem is, that silent SMS are - well, silent. User cannot see whether he or she has got that kind of SMS. It would be great if TextSecure would have an option to detect silent SMS'es and show them. BTW, silent SMS'es could be detected with Osmocom paltform. There is an application for Osmocom called Catcher catcher, which also detects silent SMS's, more info here: https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/catcher/wiki However, Osmocom is highly &quot;hacking&quot; platform, it is not usable for everyday use. Does this idea sounds interesting?

		There are several issues after updating to the newest android - the 4.4. 1 - The software is not identified by the system. What I mean by that? From people list, when pressing the &quot;create message&quot; automatically is chosen the default Messaging and do not provide me with the possibility to choose the Text Secure as in android 4.3. As it was never installed. 2 - When I receive sms messages they are delivered both to the Text Secure and Messaging - the default one. Hence, I get too double notifications - which is annoying. Can be solve these issues?

		I dont personally use Google Play myself, but I would still like to use this application. It seems that TextSecure is only avaible va Google Play. I use only F-Droid myself. It is repository for Android that contains only free and open source software. https://f-droid.org/ So could you upload TextSecure to F-Droid? Or can I download .apk from somewhere else than Google Play?

		Trying to open a group message sent to mulitple recipients, no pictures attached. TextSecure crashes and goes back to home screen. Cached passphrase timeout doesn't seem to clear passphrase after this. This appears to be similar to an issue that &quot;tin-can&quot; reported 4 months ago, but he didn't provide a logcat. Phone, OS, environment and logcat info listed below.

		I'd like an option to store messages in the normal texting database. Possibly display some sort of indication that messages are being stored in an unecrypted form in the normal database. The reason for this request is that the MMS messages don't seem to be fully ironed out and I seem to miss some.

			<description>
		Since MMS doesn't work very well for me, I use Verizon Messages to receive MMS, and Textsecure for SMS. However in version 1.0.6 in KitKat I can't disable MMS in Textsecure like I used to be able to. If I uncheck &quot;Enable Manual MMS&quot;, one of two things will happen: Seems to work, but then if you go back into MMS preferences again it's still checked OR Doesn't work and says &quot;Manual MMS settings are required for your phone&quot;. Is it possible to use Textsecure for only SMS on KitKat?

		It's nice that TextSecure can be a drop in replacement for the text app. However when it sends a text to someone it sends the real phone number as the sender. It'd be nice to be able to send my Google Voice number instead as that's the public facing number I am using and it won't surprise my contacts with my real number sending the message. Thanks!

		When using the SELinux feature default deny, TextSecure is not allowed to read SMS. In order to import the messages, this permission has to be requested/manually given of course. But when a user forgets to set the permission before starting TextSecure for the first time, it is not possible to import the messages except if the app is un- and reinstalled. It would be great if the message import could be manually started at a later point.

		I've read on various sources that TextSecure uses data/GCM to send messages, but I haven't seen this mentioned explicitly anywhere. Since data is usually free but SMS cost, can you be more explicit (both in the UI and in docs) about whether the message will go over data or over SMS?

		This only happens when using dark theme. When you type an sms, you can barely see the text you are typing, as it is white on white background. When you press Send, then the already sent SMS appears fine (white text on black background). Perhaps, you need to change the type message text to dark gray, as opposed to white. Also, to have the complete dark theme experience, it would make sense to have the welcome screen also theme changeable. For now, it stays white background/black text regardless of the theme chosen.

		I think you should try to make it act more like stock messaging with the back button. When I am running the app, selecting the texts to read from the message bar, they always just add on top of the previous views, even if they are the same view. As an example, I just read three texts from my friend, then five from my girlfriend, now I want back to the main menu and I have to hit the back button eight times to get back to the main menu. That does not seem intuitive and I could see that causing memory issues.

		Using 1.0.6 on KitKat, Moto X, T-Mobile LTE. I send a group message to three other recipients - MMS conversation mode, everybody receives it, all is well. Responses come in, and aren't appended to the thread I started however. Two recipients who use iPhones (if that matters) responses are appended to my 1-1 threads with them, respectively (both have group messaging via MMS enabled on their phones). The message details for these responses confirm that they were sent over MMS. Responses from the other recipient, who is using the Android Messaging app, are appended to a different group thread with the same recipients (and if I delete that, it creates a new thread). But her responses are the only ones that ever end up in that thread, because everyone else's goes to their own 1-1 threads with me. She also has group messaging via MMS enabled. Other MMS (picture messages) work fine (I haven't customized the MMS proxy settings at all). I'm thinking this has to be something on TextSecure's end, but I can't really figure out why -- let me know what other message/log info I can provide to track it down?

		Feature request: Could TextSecure have an option to pass the encrypted SMS message (or preferably dummy replacements like &quot;TextSecure encrypted [SMS/MMS]&quot;) into the standard database? This may fix the issue for applications which read the standard SMS database history for accounting and would allow messaging history (but not decrypted text) to be viewed in the standard SMS client. It would also allow Tasker to perform actions on SMS arrival (again without access to the decrypted text). UI options could change a radio buttons such as: o Use only TextSecure for SMS messages o Use only TextSecure for encrypted SMS messages o Use TextSecure and standard delivery for SMS Rationale: Inbound encrypted SMS messages don't trigger Tasker notifications, and outbound messages don't seem to appear in my DroidStats SMS accounting. Similarly neither inbound or outbound encrypted messages appear in the default messenger (cyanogenmod). Unencrypted text messages seem to trigger Tasker fine on arrival, presumably after being checked by TS. WhisperSystems#8 has note that there's no standard API for writing to the SMS database, but I hope (possibly uninformed) it'd be possible to allow the SMS message to continue the regular delivery path (as is the case with unencrypted text) after TextSecure sees it. WhisperSystems#464 notes that TextSecure can't use the standard SMS DB for its own storage, however it may be acceptable to have (encrypted or dummy) messages stored in both. WhisperSystems#324 seems to be the reverse of this request - I'd like to be able to have TextSecure not intercept encrypted text if desired. Here in Australia SMS messages potentially cost $US 0.30 - 0.50 after hitting a &quot;cap&quot; and as TextSecure is potentially sending SMS silently for key exchange or having SMS broken into multiple messages after encryption could lead to &quot;bill shock&quot; for users not aware of it. Apologies if this has already been raised - I didn't see anything directly suggesting this. EDIT: Typo

		I read that you're working towards using your own servers for the messages instead of going through the regular text service. I would prefer to continue using my phones regular text service as I have unlimited texts, but a limited amount of data usage per month. So I thought I'd throw this out here to suggest you continue supporting the option to use the default texting service. Maybe have an option under settings called &quot;use textsecure servers for messages.&quot; Could even have it checked by default if you wanted, but I'd prefer to continue using my phone providers default service.

		Currently the defined authentication methods for TextSecure are tightly coupled with the underlying authentication mechanism. This makes it difficult to add new mechanisms for authentication as all clients must be updated to support the new mechanism. For example, if you previously authenticated a TextSecure user and wish to call that user then you cannot rely on the previous TextSecure authentication to identify the user. With the generic method defined here, clients will not require code changes to support new authentication mechanisms, and if a separate authentication layer is used, such as Redphone, then the user may not need to re-authenticate users.

		Apps which use SMS commands for remote activation (such as prey/prey-android-client) cannot be used on a phone running TextSecure. Is it possible for TextSecure to have a user-configurable whitelist of txt messages (such as &quot;GO PREY&quot;) which it knows to pass along unencrypted to standard SMS database for whatever other apps are triggered by incoming SMS? (I'm not an android developer so I may have this all wrong, but in the case of Prey it looks like the receive priority is already MAX_INT - https://github.com/prey/prey-android-client/blob/161bae8c113d93022d057952793931a3de350486/AndroidManifest.xml#L210 . My diagnosis could be wrong - the &quot;go prey&quot; txt didn't work for me and appeared to have been swallowed by TextSecure, Googling the problem gave confirmation bias)

		TextSecure decides to use US formatted numbers instead of my regional or national numbers. I tried both international and regional numbers for this contact but when attempting to setup a secure session I get: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientFormattingException: Recipient: 012-345-678901 is badly formatted. The behavior seems to be somewhat random - sometimes I get it for the key exchange, sometimes for non-encrypted messages while the session is being set up (which fails as the exchange message is not sent) - now, after setting my phone language to local I got it to work (although it took a few attempts). So this means for me: When I set my phone to English it never works, as TextSecure always attempts to use the US numbering scheme. Doesn't matter whether or not the number is stored as an international one (+49012345678901) or a regional one (012345678901). When I set my phone to my native Language it sometimes works.

		The symptoms are these. I send a message as follows (I'm not French so excuse any errors): &quot;Je suis déjà chez moi, mais si tu es empêchée je peux aller voir si le carrefour a quelque chose?&quot; ...and my friend receives the following: &quot;Je suis déjà chez moi, mais si tu es empêchée je peux aller voir sécurité, donc j'espère que ça restera fixed!&quot; The &quot;second half&quot; of the message received isn't garbage, it seems to be something that occurred previously in our conversation. I'm using TextSecure but sending a plaintext message, and the recipient is using the vanilla messaging client. Versions: me: Cyanogenmod / Android 4.3.1, TextSecure version I wish I knew, installed 2 weeks ago from google play store. them: Android 4.0.4 It's worth noting that this behaviour happened back when I was using the HTC stock OS, which was I believe Android 2.4 or something, again with the newest TextSecure. It doesn't happen all the time, but on about 10% of the messages, perhaps? We have a pretty big (±1000) thread going, that might be it, I haven't seen it with other people. It's not impossible that on their phone stuff is breaking, but they assure me it never happens with anyone else. I'd like to help troubleshoot this because I like TextSecure a lot, so please ask away if by any chance I've forgotten something.

		As someone who doesn't do any android programming, I am having a hard time reading the source code to find out what crypto is actually going on in this app. The description says local and on-the-wire encryption, but more specifically what methods are being used? I would appreciate a note in the description and in the app (a &quot;crypto details&quot; info page, if you will) which makes it clear to users what standards TextSecure is using. E.g. when I use https, chrome tells me I'm using encryption with the little lock. But, as an interested user I can click for more info to find that my connection to github uses 128-bit encryption, TLS 1.2, encrypted/authenticated using AES_128_GCM, with ECDHE_RSA key exchange. The more I know about what crypto is publicly claimed to be in use, the more faith I have in the open source peer reviewed nature of the app, and the better suited I will be to avoid improper (insecure) use of the app's features.

So, TextSecure offers me in that case to choose from: Mobile +491717654321 Mobile +491717654321 Mobile +49 171 7654321 Which are all the same.

		When I have a contact who also uses TextSecure and I want to verify that we have properly set up a secure channel, we perform an out of band verification of the Idenity Key Fingerprints. There are two ways (that I can tell) to see my own Identity Fingerprint. One is through the lock on the conversation page (the left in the image), and the other is through the main menu (the right) As you can see, they don't agree. So far the person who I've tested with has seen the key on the right and not the key on the left (which is the one that I'm being told to read to them).

		When I first installed TextSecure, I set it up using my phone's number provided by my carrier. After some testing, I decided to register my Google Voice number instead. Not seeing a clear way to unregister my existing number, I wiped the app data through settings, and then registered again using my Google Voice number. My old number still appears to be registered, so if a TextSecure user tries to send a message using the PUSH transport, those messages are silently dropped. If the other user disables PUSH and uses SMS, I do receive the messages he sends to me, but they are encrypted to my old key (which is what I would expect). He sees both my current identity key (which is working fine) and my old identity key, but there's no apparent way to remove the old one.

		When tapping group notifications in the notification drawer, TextSecure tries to address a reply to the person who was responsible for the last received message in a group chat. The group name also changes to the phone number + name of the personal contact that TextSecure tries to reply to, instead of the usual group name. Any messages sent through this particular window will end up in the personal chat of the last respondent instead of the group chat. In order to reproduce: Open inbound group message through notification drawer Try to send a message in the group chat window within TextSecure. (Notice that the group name has changed to the person who sent the last reply so far.) Attempt to send a message to the group, only to have it end up in the personal message conversation of the person who sent the last message in the group chat.

		I can't get the Push directory to update and recognize the new number format with the country code. This is happening for a couple of contacts which I already had in my address book as &quot;zone-number&quot; and later edited to &quot;+country-zone-number&quot; so the universal ID would work. I already had TextSecure working before the push update as SMS app. Wanted to give the Push feature a try, so: I had a contact with the following number: Juan de los Palotes (011)-5555-4444 I edited said number to: Juan de los Palotes +54-11-5555-4444 But, even though I see the new number in my android contacts listing (editing the subject), and in the TextSecure interface if I press the &quot;plus&quot; to write a new message I see the name and the new number below it (in the listing of all the contacts), when I click the user, it takes me to my message thread with said user, where the name above has the old number below it. If I disable SMS/MMS and fallback mode, the message fails with &quot;Error sending message&quot;. The background is green, and in message details it shows the transport is SMS. If I enable SMS or fallback mode, it's sent vía SMS. So, SMS is working every time (old number or new number), but I can't get the app to recognize the number with the new format in push mode, even though I went to &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Refresh Push Directory&quot; after editing the contact. Even restarted the phone just in case I needed to log-out/in. Also worth noting: My friend can send me push notifications in the same chat thread. He sees his chats as blue, while mine are always green. If I long press and see the message details for his messages, I see they are &quot;Push&quot;.

		The option in the configuration settings to disable SMS, and go push-only is currently greyed out on my phone. By tweeting at Moxie, I learned that the reason for this is that TextSecure is currently set to be the default SMS app. Rather than greying out the option, and not letting the user turn Whisper's SMS feature off, perhaps it would be better to have a usable error message when the user clicks the greyed out checkbox. Telling them why it is greyed out, telling them how to remedy it, or perhaps even allowing them to make something other than Whisper the default SMS app from within the Whisper config would all be better.

		Phone: Motorola Defy XT O/S: Android 2.3.7 Provider: Republic Wireless Possibly related: my provider does not support MMS messages (at least not on my plan/model of phone). Steps to reproduce: 1.) Send message to someone who has the latest version of TextSecure (as of 2/24/2014) 2.) Message was not encrypted 3.) Attempt to initiate secure session via the unlock icon 4.) Green speech bubble appears from the right with a key icon which says &quot;Error sending message&quot; 5.) Register phone number over cell data plan/SMS, failed 6.) Go home, turn on wifi, connect to AP, register phone number successfully 7.) Now secure testing works as expected There are two reasons I don't like this: A.) I'd prefer to not be on a list of phone numbers that use TextSecure. I don't understand why such a list exists. B.) Since the new protocol doesn't appear to require SMS nor MMS, I would like to be able to use TextSecure via WiFi on a phone with no provider. If registration was not required, or if it were possible to register without providing a phone number and requiring that an SMS be sent/received, it seems like this would work fine. It'd be especially awesome if it would integrate with SIP/VoIP.

		When another application is configured as the default SMS application on Android 4.4, TextSecure still intercepts and stores incoming SMS messages, but outgoing messages (sent with the other application) are missing in the conversation thread in TextSecure. When a user wants to only use TextSecure for secure messaging, those threads (containing one side of an unencrypted conversation) can be distracting. It should be possible to (optionally) restrict TextSecure to only store encrypted messages (and leave unencrypted messages to the default application). Alternatively, the telephony provider should be used to import sent messages so that at least both sides of the conversation are visible in TextSecure.

		Currently the CyanogenMod TextSecure setup process is very opaque about what exactly TextSecure will do, and how it will use SMS. This is a problem because anyone who pays per message needs and wants to know exactly what's going to happen if they start using this app in a chatty way - will it send a lot of SMS, none, some? When? The CM setup for TextSecure needs to make it very clear that SMS will not be sent between TextSecure devices, and also make it easy to ensure that SMS will not be sent without TextSecure prompting to do so. I have repeatedly disabled TextSecure when installing CM because these facts are not made clear at setup, and I already use WhatsApp - whereas, having now learned about how TextSecure works, it seems like a much better improvement for me then WhatsApp while providing the same functionality.

When we try to scan our keys to verify the recipient, his key is different to the key I got from him, therefore I can't verify the integrity. (I don't think I am under special surveillance from NSA/BND, so I don't think I am the victim of a Man-In-The-Middle or something). Our messages are send encrypted (according to the padlock), and we can read each other's messages. How is this possible? I don't see any option to reset / delete any keys, so I am not able to just initiate a new key exchange.

		I just got disconnected from data right before messaging another TextSecure v2 user, who only uses TextSecure with Push and does not have SMS/MMS enabled. Since I have &quot;Allow SMS Fallback&quot; enabled, this made my phone send out the message as an SMS (green background). That message is still &quot;sending&quot; now that I came back to have a data connection. But TextSecure should know that the other side cannot receive an encrypted SMS, right? So I think this is a bug: encrypted SMS should only be sent if both sides use TextSecure for SMS.

		Serious bug that can render conversation with a specific contact almost un-usable. Particular case: My friend had TextSecure, but uninstalled it when he re-flashed his ROM. In the previous version of TextSecure I simply pressed padlock&gt;abort secure session. However, since the update my phone tries to send him encrypted texts over data. None of these he receives because he does not have the app installed anymore. I can long-press send to enable the option to &quot;send unencrypted&quot; however, when sending sms over data is enabled, it will still send encrypted even though I instructed it not to do so. This is another bug. The only way to send him texts anymore is to disable sms over data in settings, and then long-press send to send unencrypted, only then will the app actually send an unencrypted text message. I have to do this every time I want to reply to him. It's greatly annoying. So in a nutshell, the three problems are: App does not check that user actually still uses TextSecure, and forces a secure connection even when one cannot be made. There is no easy way to force the app to send unencrypted texts to a user when data mode is enabled. When data mode is disabled, the method is still unclear and requires &quot;send unencrypted&quot; to be chosen each time you want to send a message. The removal of &quot;abort secure session&quot; has made this problem very bad, I cannot delete old keys from my key inventory. Long-press the send button when data is enabled to access &quot;send unencrypted&quot; does not work. Will always revert to sending an encrypted message. These three problems make the app almost unusable with certain contacts who have uninstalled TextSecure.

		A friend was offline in TextSecure v2 until a few minutes ago. I had sent out two messages in the meantime: the first over push, the second over encrypted SMS. The SMS was received by my friend, but got stuck in &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot;, see bug #240. No Push message was shown as received. After TextSecure restart, the SMS was decrypted. But the push message never showed up and seems to be lost. I'm wildly guessing that while SMS receive was stuck, the Push message was still stuck in processing queue (albeit being sent out first; but it was probably received later than the SMS), and after app restart it was just gone. The SMS was seemingly cached to be available and decryptable after app force close, but the GCM message wasn't.

On #682, I saw moxie0 mention something about registering on more than one server. I accidentally registered twice, I'm not sure if that's the problem. I've tried other roms before, and it had a WhisperSystems app on it, that I might've registered before. Is there anyway for me to unregister so I can re-register it? I'm not sure what to do here.

When it downloads the image or MMS contents, it then vibrates. Can we get an option in the menu to automatically download MMS when they are received (Maybe only on WiFi)? Or at least vibrate when the message is received, not when it is downloaded. I've also seen an issue where the main contacts list does not show an undownloaded MMS's thread that I haven't opened as being unread, and does not sort it to the top of the list where other unread messages are, based on received times. If I don't click on the notification, I have to remember who it was from, and scroll down to find my thread with them. I believe these two issues are related.

		When a person says something in a group chat and I get an Android notification, and then tap on the notification, it will throw me into a chat that looks like a chat with only that one person instead. The title states the name of the person that was shown in the notification, not of the group chat, and all the UI is the same as in a 1-on-1 chat. There are also no names displayed on top of the messages. The weird broken thing is that it will not actually be the chat with that person, but it will show messages from the group chat. I can even send messages there, it just gets very confusing because the messages appear to be sent only to that single person. It's a mere display error that can be fixed by exiting the chat with the person (tapping on left arrow in upper left corner of the screen) and then selecting the group chat again. It will then show as a group chat. No logs end up in the wrong place or anything, and the names of the people that sent you messages are correctly shown. I see this as a critical bug, since users might end up sending secret messages to a group containing other users, without being able to see that the other users are even there.

		In conversation view, every message has a timstamp and a lock symbol beneath it. This is taking up a lot of space, which I think is unnecessary. Therefore, I propose not to display the timestamp if it is the same as the previous messages or differs only by a certain amount of time (say, less than a minute). As the padlock should still be displayed, let me suggest aligning own messages to the left in multi-line message bubbles (Google Hangouts does it that way, too, and I find it a lot easier to read) and to place the padlock symbol at the right end of the last line. For single-line messages, either a margin and then the padlock in the same line would be imaginable. I believe that these changes would increase readability and orientation, as temporal pauses in conversation are easier to spot and more messages fit the screen without it looking cramped. (I also think that the spacing between messages is a little high in general, but that is a matter of preference I guess)

As soon as I disable the &quot;SMS Fallback&quot; option, msgs are not send at all. http://hastebin.com/navowohexu Since I have to pay for each SMS this renders the app useless for me.

However, if you get a group message while the group is not displayed and enter it by pressing the system notification, the group will display as if it was a contact, e.g. it will show the name of the last person to talk inside the group as the group name and not show the contact names inside the chat window. Going back to the conversations list and entering the group again makes it show up correctly again.

		A while ago, when i switched to CyanogenMod, i started whisper to have a look at. I switched then back to TextSecure with no problem. When i now try to activate the push messages in TextSecure i got this message: Registration conflict &quot;This number is already registered on a different textsecure server (cyanogenmod?). You must unregistering there before registering here.&quot; I don't want to switch to whisper. One advantage of TextSecure is the encrypted database of my messages. An other advantage is the import/export, because i like to switch my ROM sometimes and so i use this feature regularly. Hope now this question is right here - maybe it is not a direct Issue with TextSecure rather than CyanogenMod: Where and how can i unregister from the CyanogenMod-TextSecure-Server?

But registration takes forever (8h with a commit from yesterday, no fail but i tried the new commit, and about 1h with 038bebf) and than fails. From the issues i have read so far I am not sure if it could have something to do that i don't use any Google services? Play Store is installed though.

But I got a few instances where the message wouldn't show up unless I kill TS and relaunch it. Interestingly, I have the setting &quot;Disable passphrase&quot; ticked, so I would not expect any encryption/decryption to take place. http://hastebin.com/xohasorolu

		If you forward a message, you will get a slightly &quot;unconventional&quot; dialogue, with the plus button to add target contacts... advantage of the current solution: You can insert a number that's not in the current contact list. - But how often do you need that? IMHO you should see a similar list as the list to create a new chat. But contact entry has a checkbox on the right side. Advantage: it is more intuitive and you see who has used TextSecure and who not.

			<description>
		Yesterday morning my phone auto-updated TextSecure. I noticed the icon had just changed to the circular one, so clicked it, and authenticated. I followed the one-time process of registering on the server, and all seemed normal. Later, i found out that a message I'd sent on the 18th december (to two recipients) had just been received by them. I presume it had failed to send back in december due to bad signal or some such, and the software update had just tried it again (I know where I was when I sent the message has little or no signal a lot of the time). Seeing as the message was &quot;I'm in the pub&quot; and was sent at 8.15am, it lead to a few probing questions about my drinking habits ;-) Anyway, I doubt this is the sort of thing we can track down and &quot;fix&quot;, but I thought I'd mention it and see if anyone else was affected. TextSecure is showing version 2.0.2 right now, although I think it updated again during the night, so I'm not sure exactly which version sent the ancient unsent messages.

		Sending certain emoticons from an Android 4.4 device to a phone with an older Android version leads to empty messages for the receiver: On the left side, the sending phone has Android 4.4, the phone on the right has Android 4.3 (Nexus 5 and Galaxy Nexus, both stock). As you can see, it does not effect all emoticons (my guess would be that this happens only with emoticons that are new to 4.4?). I also have a Nexus 4 (Android 4.4) user in the group who can see all emoticons, and a Galaxy 3 (Android 4.3) user who cannot see the same emoticons as the other 4.3 (Galaxy Nexus) user. So I'm pretty sure that the problem is related to the Android version (everybody is using TS 2.0.3). I don't even know if this issue can be addressed by TS, maybe by limiting the available emoticons to those that are available on all platforms (but this might require to get emoticons directly into the app and not the keyboard or something alike).

		Android's multitasking features include a most recently used list of apps and thumbnail screenshots of their last state. This is a potential information leak. An assailant who has gained access to the user's device but does not know the password used for unlocking the TextSecure app and decrypting its local storage may still be able to gain access to secure information by looking at the thumbnail MRU and any cached copies which may still exist on or be recovered from the device's memory and filesystems. If possible it would be best to prevent these thumbnails from containing information in the first place by having the app feed the system a static image such as solid black or black with a logo.

			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		Falling back is an useful feature to have turned on. However, I could think of several scenarios when the &quot;silent&quot; falling back behavior is not desired: When I send a message to a friend oversea and TextSecure is not available for that person: I will get charged a lot when the app silently falls back and proceeds to send the text oversea. When I send a message to a friend because I expected the friend to have TextSecure but actually they had turned it off for some reason: That means my communication is no longer secret. Imagine I am about to send something assuming it will be send securely, but at the moment the app sends it, it decides to falls back silently. I think an non-intrusive way to implement this is to warn the user in-line (in the chat message area) that the message cannot be delivered securely (or cannot be delivered securely anymore), and ask the user to tap the send button again to confirm sending it. They would have to tap the send button again to send that message in the insecure mode. Of course they only have to tap twice to switch from secure -&gt; insecure once. The next time they would have to tap only once since they already knew it. Of course, I think not everyone wants this feature, so I think it's sensible to have an option to warn the user, but have that turned off by default.

		I am currently evaluating the TextSecure app. I can compile it just fine, but there's two things i can't find sources for. One thing is the WhisperSystems/gson (dependency in library subproject) and the other is the armeabi.jar. I wonder if the gson library is 100% based on google's code? If so, why are you packaging your own lib? The same goes for android-support-lib and the gcm libraries. As for the armeabi.jar, i couldn't really track that one down. I would love to look into that, too. I hope, i'm not missing some obvious part of documentation or something. If I do, please just point me in the right direction. Cheers!

		Hello dear TextSecure Team, I did install you app on my mobile phone and find out that if I’m using 2G/3G/LTE network – I will never receive any message. But I can send them. I will receive all messages since I got connected to WiFi, or if I establish VPN through mobile network. Could you please investigate this issue? I did check with provider and they are not blocking any ports for me, Mobile Phone - Galaxy S3 LTE, Android 4.3. Provider Telekom Deutschland. Please let me know if you need more information.

I rotated it there to the correct orientation. When i send it via Textsecure and picture were displayed in the old wrong orientation. When i tab on my send pictures, they are also displayed in wrong orientation. I'm not sure if Textsecure does it wrong here, but this is the only place i discovered this strange behavior.

		Occasionally, I receive two messages over PUSH with the exact same &quot;Sent&quot; time, where the second message can't be decrypted. Further messages can be sent/received fine without restarting a secure session.

The next message becomes delivered (blue background) but not the first message which stays forever on &quot;sending..&quot; with green background.

		When TextSecure is configured to: not be the default SMS app, not use SMS fallback, it seems that when an SMS is received it shows up interleaved with the secure data-channel messages, even though it already shows up in the default SMS app. My expected behavior is that in this configuration TextSecure should be concerned with (only) messages sent and received over the data channel.

		I just found the feature to manually send an unencrypted message (long press on the send icon), which I thought is what I wanted. Exept it isn't. I'm not sure what this should accomplish, so I don't know if the behaviour is a bug or if I want a new feature. This is what I want: Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection the mesage gets sent via sms the message is encrypted Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off the message gets sent via SMS the message is encrypted Case 3: I am in an encrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS the message is encrypted Case 4: I am in an unencrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted This is what I would expect from &quot;send unencrypted message&quot;: Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection the mesage gets sent via data message is not encrypted Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted Case 3: I am in an encrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted Case 4: I am in an unencrypted SMS chat the message gets sent via SMS message is not encrypted That's how it &quot;works&quot;, at least for me: Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection the message gets sent via data (I don't know it this should be happening) message is encrypted (this should probably not happen) Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off the message gets sent via SMS the message is not encrypted I haven't tested case 3 and 4 yet (tell me if you want me to). Is there any use in having this function? If so, could you quickly explain what it's supposed to do and why? It doesn't really help if two people write via SMS and somehow the session gets messed up - you could just go ahead and end or renew the session via the lock in the top bar. I would personally like to be able to manually force the use of SMS and several friends asked me if it's implemented already. For most of them the usecase for that looks like this: The receiver turns off wifi and mobile internet to not be disturbed by instant messages or mails while doing important work. The expectation is, If somebody really needs to contact you, they'll either call or write a text message. Many people I know use exactly this behaviour at work and others know that. So when it's working hours, the other one doesn't immediately reply to your push messages, and you have to contact them, forcing TS to send an SMS is the next best option. No need for TS to know if they are offline (#677, #678)

		We all heard about &quot;BlackPhone&quot; and all the buzz it generated in the media. Well - BlackPhone entirely depends on the SilentCircle suit of applications and is apart from that just... Android excl. Google Play. So it came to my mind, that a stripped down version of android in conjunction with Whisper could be ideal for people striving for maximum security. I recommend not to sell a device like BlackPhone does, but instead create something like a privacy-oriented custom rom lacking the traditional phone app and using Whisper's services instead.

		Hi. I was grepping the code for weird places to confirm if I can use TextSecure as my SMS replacement. I saw that MasterSecret nulls out some buffer in its constructor where secretKey and macKey was residing. Is this because we don't want to leave some copy of the secretKey in freed memory? I guess so. But than again MasterSecret gets copied around often in Parcel I think. For each Intent.putExtra and for the single MasterSecret.parcelClone call (why?). Why aren't these copies nulled out after use? Especially because Parcel comes from a pool with no documented scope.

		The sharing of, e.g. Images, from another app or browser to a group in TextSecure is not possible. It is not possible, selecting the group. Also in this dialoug select single users about the &quot;+&quot; is not possible. The user is still not selected. It is only possible to select individual user via search. Workaround for sharing to a group would be: Images from other APPs save before in his gallery and then in TextSecure within the group insert the image about &quot;Attachment&quot;. However, this is very uncomfortable

		I communicate with some recipients who enable their mobile's data channel only sporadically. This means that messages I sent to them (via PUSH) may not be received by them for hours. IMHO, this defeats the purpose of a short message, which is supposed to be delivered instantaneously. So I wonder: Is there a way to configure TS so that it falls back to SMS delivery if PUSH doesn't succeed within a few seconds? Can I enable PUSH globally, but disable it for certain recipients?

		Hey, I've the problem that I do not recieve andy PUSH messages at all, however can write to everybody via push and the messages are delivered without any error. If I disable networking textsecure works without any problems via SMS. I'm using CM 7.2 for GT5830i, which does not contain whisperpush (as long as I know). Could it be, that the following caused this error: Installed textsecure, registered at the server for PUSH, deinstalled it 5 minutes later as there was no contact from me with textsecure, without desubscribing from push. Two days later I reinstalled textsecure, multiple times registering and deregistering at the server doesn't help, also deinstallation and reinstallation of textpush while deleting cache, and data doesn't work. If it helps I can send my mobile phone number (privately) to a dev, maybe this helps to track the issue down (if someone has access to the server).

		With the new PUSH Protocol, I believe the string: preferences__allow_sms_fallback_disabled_reason in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/values/strings.xml might be misleading. If you are not registered for push, it says TS is configured as default SMS app and this is the reason you can't disable SMS fallback. However I think the reason is because I'm not registered for push. So there could be two reasons why one can't disable SMS fallback: not registered for push or default SMS app. Maybe the string should be updated.

		When sending messages via textsecure on a mostly blocked wifi connection, the messages are delivered properly, but replies end up being queued until I change connections. At work we have wifi with almost all ports closed. I can send textsecure messages to people and they are delivered properly, but when those people reply to me, I don't get anything until I leave the office. As soon as I'm out of range of the office wifi, and my phone switches over to 3G, I get all the messages delivered at once. While this is great for not being interrupted at work, I'm not sure it's the desired behaviour. Anything I can do to help debug this, or work around it? For now, I'm just staying off my work wifi and using 3G.

		Alice starts a secure session with Bob, they exchange keys and Bob's key is correctly stored in ''Contact Keys'' as expected. In this process, Bob's phone number is received and stored as +CountycodeAreacodePhonenumber. In Alice's contact list, however, Bob's number had been stored as +Countrycode AreaCode Phonenumber, ie. the different parts are separated by spaces. It seems that the two entries are not recognized as equal by TextSecure, i.e. Bob's entry is not marked green (as a TextSecure contact). This is somewhat misleading,one work around is to edit the entry (removing the spaces) in Alice's contact list.

The gui shows a padlock after I send a message, but by that point it is too late. If they don't have TextSecure what do they get and see? Is the message plaintext? If they do have TextSecure, but remove it, does my message get sent plaintext instead? Thanks.

		Hello, thanks for your great work. I am please you take that effort to make communication more secure to us. One enhancement (if I did not oversee the functionality) I deeply miss is the possibility to chose whether the message should be sent via mobile network or via SMS. Sometimes I do not have a data connection (or the person I communicate with) and in this case I would be happy if I could either re-send the message via SMS or if the system gave me the option to define a timer like &quot;if the message cannot be sent via data within 10 minutes do it via SMS&quot;. Thanks a lot!

Also I'd love to use it as a replacement of the stock sms app, but there is one open problem for me: Since I have friends abroad, sending sms to them is quite expensive. So I'd suggest to check and compare country codes of the telephone numbers and whenever they don't match textsecure should ask the user before using sms fallback... Despite of this issue, I have to say I'm impressed of your work and I highly appreciate it... (and sorry for my first post being a feature request -_-)

		When a push message to a group cannot be sent immediately (eg. bad network connection) the message's background is displayed in light blue (light theme). The details for this message state that it is to be sent as MMS, which is wrong. After the message has been sent, the details are corrected to PUSH.

		When closing the Textsecure app from the default app-switcher (see screenshot) it also closes the app-switcher itself unlike if i close other apps from the app-switcher. I'm using Cyanogenmod-Version 11-20140210-SNAPSHOT-M3-mako, my TextSecure is up-to-date. Although it is not a big issue, it is annoying (might annoy others too) and i think it might lead to other errors. The following screenshot was taken right before closing Textsecure by swiping from left to right. After that, the app-switcher closes. 👍 1

		After receiving a MMS message the top info bar only shows the sender of that MMS and the chat history for that group is shown; however, immediately drafted replies are sent as SMS only to that sender, rather than as MMS to the group. Hitting the back arrow and then re-selecting the conversation then shows it as a group conversation and replies are drafted and send as MMS. It seems like the appropriate behavior would be for the app to initially draft/send as MMS to the whole group, in this situation.

		Alice starts a conversation with Bob. She changes app to the browser and finds an image she wants to link to Bob (or any other shareable thing). She opens up the share menu and chooses TextSecure. The view at this point is a blank conversation window (no recipient) and the message prefilled. There are two issues: Alice was previously looking at Bob's conversation and it would be good to follow the convention of showing the last thing Alice saw in the app. Hangouts does this. If Alice re-enters Bob's number, the send icon is for an unsecured message, even though when Alice hits send it is in fact an encrypted message and is appended to the existing conversation. So the request is: when sharing something to TextSecure, use the existing conversation view if it exists, otherwise mirror Hangouts and allow choosing an existing recipient from the contact list.

		when i dont have a key for a contact then the lock menu does not appear when i select them with the plus sign to compose a new message so i can not initiate secure communications. i need to send them plain text then have them initiate in return. this is less efficient than letting me straight off initiate. if i know someone has textsecure on their phone then i should be able to send a key request off the bat, like i could in textsecure version 1. it is cleaner this way. if they dont have textsecure then there is a wasted request but so what? you could add something that says &quot;this user is trying to establish encrypted communications using textsecure. to communicate privately, please download textsecure from the play store.&quot; then you are promoting textsecure. i remind you are am talking about using the lock menu to manually start a secure session, not to spam everyone, that wouldnt be right. Adium for Mac OS does exactly what i am talking about with their OTR system.

		Hello, I'm using Textsecure on Android and got some notification issues. For app notifications I'm using Lightflow which allows me, to set up detailled notification seeting for every single apps like color of LED, sound, vibration patterns etc. These app needs turning off every notification in a certain app except the symbol in the notification bar. And this is where my problems with Textsecure began. Textsecure doesn't allows it to turn off the LED, neither the sound, but this is neccesary for apps like Lightflow. I can choose &quot;none&quot; for the sound, but it turns to &quot;default&quot;. So it would be really nice if you can make it possible to disable every single kind of notification in Textsecure.

		It would be very nice if TextSecure could store the status of verification and show it with colors or so. The concept is implemented by Threema, where it is shown with colors and dots, how reliable the public key from a contact is. It ist described here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threema#Usability This would it make easier to understand how secure connections are and you could see which contacts are verified yet and which are outstanding.

		Think its a good idea if you're able to see if a contacts key was verified (with the QR scan feature). The lock symbol in the Conversation could be colored (e. g. blue) to reflect the verified state. Even contacts could get another color (blue?) in the contact list for verified contacts. This would it make easy to see which keys are manually verified (blue -&gt; verified, green -&gt; using TextSecure but unverified). Might be also a good idea to display the date of the last manual verification in the contacts key window (where the contacts key is displayed).

		Still all SMS from senders that use non-numeric sender IDs go to the Anonymous thread. (e.g. SMS from cellphoneproviders or banks or delivery services). They can't be distinguished in there, because their real sender ID is omitted. That makes TextSecure unusable as an default SMS App replacement imho. I know this is a dupe of #665, but there is a fix for that ( i.e. #693 ) and it won't get merged to the master branch, while minor fixes get pushed through. Please consider taking this fix into the next release version.

		What I really like about TextSecure is that I have one App to handle all my messages (SMS, MMS and Internet). But I always have a bad feeling if I send a large message because I'm never 100 percent sure that the message will be send over the network connection and not as an SMS. If this happens by accident, e.g. because the network connection is temporarily down or because I thought that the recipient also uses TectSecure but he doesn't, then it can become really expensive. It would be great if SecureText could provide a warning before sending a message as SMS. Something like &quot;Message will be send as SMS? [continue] [postpone] [cancel]&quot;. &quot;continue&quot; will send the message as SMS, &quot;cancel&quot; will cancel the action and &quot;postpone&quot; will keep the message back until the network connection becomes available again and then send it (ideally) automatically. If the recipient doesn't use TextSecure the &quot;postpone&quot; option should be hidden. What do you think about such a feature?

		Hello! I wrote this already in the bithub comment but i thought it might be better to post it here. I hope this is okay. I like you great approach to give developer a tribute by paying them. But for me &quot;as a supporter&quot; it would be cooler if I could decide for what bug/issue/feature I like to give the coins. Sure there should always be a little split (lets say for example 2% of the donation) which goes into commits for generally issues. Elementary.os, for example, took a nicer way. They choose bountysource.com (opensource) to do that (http://elementaryos.org/journal/fix-bugs-get-paid) however... everyone could decide by themselves which bug or feature are more important. Bugs which are very difficult to solve could be made more interesting for developer because of the raising money. On the other side the developer could also say an amount what he want to have to solve an issue.

		I have the following scenario: I message with a friend and everything works fine, SMS and push messages are encrypted correctly. However, when I change my SIM card (and consequently also my number) the messages sent by me over SMS can not be decrypted by my friend: Message encrypted for non-existing session... Push messages still work. Additionally, my friends messages are always sent over SMS (never over push). So the problem seems to be that my counterpart doesn't know that I am using TextSecure (or rather this new number of mine) and my TextSecure instance still encrypts messages which can not be decrypted. How can I tell TextSecure about my second number?

		If you attempt to send a message to yourself, the app prompts to initiate a key exchange. If you accept, the app will perform said key exchange with itself, but only one key is stored. All messages sent to self after this point are received as &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; Furthermore, attempting to end the secure session results in &quot;Message encrypted or non-existing session...&quot; In my opinion, messages to self should simply be stored, not sent. Disallowing messages to self is also an option, but other texting apps don't prohibit this so this could cause problems if you are importing data from, say, the default texting app.

		Text Secure appears to cause my phone to soft reboot after entering power save while it is open on-screen. It occurs about 60 seconds after the screen time-out or hitting the power button to enter power save manually. It is reproducible every time. It is the only app that does this and is fine if I jump back to the home screen first. The app is still usable as long as I remember to jump out if it. I have a HTC One XL running Telstra firmware 5.08.841.3, rooted but with standard kernel. Here is the TextSecure log: http://hastebin.com/gogojinoku I also did a logcat dump to a file then induced the problem: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24346749/logcat.txt

		I'm running CM 10.1.0 on Samsung GT-I8150 (Galaxy W) with v2.0.4 from the Google Play Store and can't register for the PushService. TextSecure gives a network/connection error. I tried 3G and WiFi, deleted user data+cache, reinstalled TS and disabled privacy without any success :-( See screenshots on https://www.wuala.co...blic/TextSecure On my girlfriend's stock rom (Sony Xperia mini 2.3.6) TextSecure can register for the push service without any problems. I can provide logfiles if usfull. See also http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/87365-whisperpush-registration-fails-connectivity-error/page__gopid__451519#entry451519

		Dear @moxie0, as much as I enjoy using TextSecure as a complete replacement for the standard SMS app, I am not happy with the registration process for the Push-Service of TextSecure. To be specific, I am running AOKP and TextSecure tells me that registering with the Push-Service is not possible without having the Google PlayStore-App installed. To be very clear about this: Google Play will NEVER EVER gain permission to land on my phone. The way I see it, being required to install Google Play (in my eyes one of the most dangerous privacy-breaking apps out there) just to be able to use the Push-Service of TextSecure (which focuses on PRIVACY) is like a snake biting its own tail. I guess TextSecure utiltizes Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), and as such Google Play is &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;, am I right? Don't get me wrong: Using TextSecure feels awesome. It just does feel that way leaving WhatsApp behind and knowing that TextSecure is being recommended by The Guardian Project and can be safely relied on to protect my data. But having to have Google Play just feels wrong. My intention is to DITCH Google completely (except for Android Custom ROMs) in the long run, not creating yet another tie for myself. So why don't we make an effort to find an alternative for this crappy Google Cloud Messaging?

		Hey there, I've installed TextSecure, I am able to send messages (via Push) but I didn't receive any. I've set TextSecure as standard messaging app and the phone is running 4.4.2. What else do you need to know? Since I changed back to standard messaging app everything works fine...

		I saw the following problem on two different Motorola Moto G devices: Sending messages to another TS user via push works well. TS crashes every time you try to send a normal, unencrypted SMS to a recipient without TS. The problem only seems to occur when the system's default SMS app is disabled. But I wonder why that is, because on my phone (GNexus) TS works just fine with a disabled SMS app. Here's the logcat: --------- beginning of /dev/log/main

 I guess the problem is that on the Moto G, divideMessage(...) calls the default SMS app which is of course not available once it is deactivated. But maybe it is possible to display a better error message instead of just crashing?

		When I send a push message while not having a data connection (e.g. by manually disabling data and wifi) and sms fallback disabled, these messages are displayed with a light blue background (light theme) as if the message is about to be sent. No error is displayed and the message is not detected as failed-to-send. When data connection returns, the messages are still displayed in the same state, without the option to resend them. Is that a bug or a feature? ;) The message details state that the message is to be sent via SMS. The only option is to manually copy and paste the text and send it again when the data connection returns.

		For some reason when someone initiates a thread with a group and I am part of it, whenever I respond it sends myself a text message as well. So I see the sent item and then it is actually going out and sending myself a text message. From then on in that thread it will continue to do so unless I make a new group and send to it.

		TextSecure doesn't make it clear when it is sending messages as SMS or as internet messages. I think this is an important issue, considering that some countries have bad mobile connections that tend to fail from time to time, what can make a long chat increase the cost involved on it

		I don't know if it's possible, but how about integrating Hangouts support just to further reducing of messaging apps to use. By now I am using the following messaging apps: Whatsapp (just for some groups) SMS + secure messaging with TextSecure Hangouts (I like the possibility to use it with Miranda IM on my computer, because I don't like browser chatting and additional IM software) To reduce (and combine messaging Threads) to one messaging application it would be graet to have Hangouts included into TextSecure. On the other hand we are losing a reason to change to TextSecure for people not yet switched. Not everyone is really interested in encryption, but is interested in using the same app everyone else does. btw: afaik ChatSecure is always using Hangouts channel, so it seems to be possible to include it.

		Hi, I have used Textsecure in the past. Now i have switched to CM 11 and enabled Whisperpush (unregistered push from Textsecure, registered Whisperpush) So, when I send now a message from a second phone with Textsecure to my phone with Whisperpush there seems to be a problem. Phone 2 sends a encrypted message to my phone via network(push). Message gets send. My phone never receives the message. There is no message, no indication, simply nothing. Is this a known problem?

After that, the error never occurred again, but I think that is kind of strange and worth reporting.

		Hi, I meant not to be crude with the title, just direct. As it is now, if you want to use the data/IM channel you have to associate TextSecure with your mobile number. I realize that &quot;data channel&quot; refers to mobile data plan, which of course should require a phone number, but if userperson wishes to use TextSecure over wifi purely as an IM, it is bizarre to ask for phone number verification. So, at this point I'd like to suggest a &quot;wifi only&quot; option at hangin' out with the setup wizard time, wherein no number is asked for. Shouldn't IM over wifi, which has no technical need for a number, be the option that does not request it for setup? Obviously mobile communication must; but wifi has no justifiable reason to. I hope that requesting a number isn't considered an &quot;anti-abuse&quot; measure, as if users who have accounts with telcos are sweet little darlings who'd nary hurt a fly, but wifi users are criminals from the wrong side of the tracks; Telegram seems to do this too, it sucks. If it's just about spam accounts, there are many ways to demand &quot;proof of work&quot; from a user. To use someone's account with a telco to verify that they are an actual individual sort of flies in the face of the modern countersurveillance movement. Thanks for your excellent work, thanks for the new IM feature which is awesome, and thanks for reading.

		I ran into an issue today as Internet connectivity is not always present where I am. Sending a message to another textsecure user the message was sent by push as that is the default. I can only assume that the receiver was without Internet connection which means that the message wouldn't arrive until they connected to Internet again (I assume?). Wouldn't it be better if textsecure attempted to use push and got a notification if the message was read. If the message was not read by the recipient within a predefined timeout then textsecure could resend the same message by sms. I can imagine quite a few users getting put off by this behavior as it is now, as they expect the message to arrive even if the receiver does not have Internet coverage. If this is covered elsewhere or there is already a solution to this I apologize.

		On my SGS 4 i9505 running CM 11 M3, newest TextSecure (2.0.5), I do not receive any push messages via TextSecure anymore. Sending out push messages are not problem. Whenever people start a new secure session, it seems to work for them but when I answer the messages are not readable &quot;encryption problem&quot;. When I restart the session, everything works fine for them and then they can read what I write again. It has worked before and &quot;just&quot; stopped about a week ago. I have tried both over GSM and wireless, with multiple users - no change. I can send messages to anyone, but receive none myself. Here is my log: http://hastebin.com/jatedulenu As it is very long and I have no clue what's important, I do not copy it all in here.

			<description>
		I. Introduction Currently near consensus has been reached in these issues about implementing a visual security model in TS: #910, #945, #766 and #741. In my oppinion this model has some problems which I'd like discuss here and propose a different model. I created this issue because right now there is no chance to change the course of the discussion in the mentioned issues. So I chose to not interfere any further, let the participants improve their model and work on an alternative model separately. II. Criticism of the proposed model This is the visual model as proposed in the aforementioned issues. Contact list I had to make this up myself based on #741. And yes, this has been done with MS Paint: Messaging window Message history As far as I know this is still missing, at least I didn't find a specific issue about it and therefore didn't find any screenshots. Discussion There is no coherent visual security schema for TS. We need one schema for all these three areas in TS: contact list, message history, messaging window. Too much information and too much redundancy which leads to a cluttered and less usable interface. There is no &quot;security at one glance&quot;. The icons under each message are too small. Visually impaired people might not even notice them. Those symbols don't increase with the chosen text size. Also, depending on the colour, the icons under each message are hard to read because the contrast is too low. Another issue with those icons is that there could be issues on smaller screens with less dpi. The lock symbol used on the contact list doesn't visualize the idea of three security levels well enough. Threema's indicator does so by telling the user that there are three levels and contrasting it with how many he already has achieved. I think this schema also presents an incentive to gain better security which the uni-coloured lock symbol doesn't. III. The alternative model I have used Threema's dots to implement the security indicator but I have also &quot;designed&quot; some other possible indicators (see below). Maybe it's not even possible to use Threema's dots due to legal reasons. This is only an example. Bear with me, I really don't know my way around a real graphics program so this is all done with MS Paint... ;) Contact list Messaging window Message history Short explanation of how this model works: First of: Threema doesn't use SMS, so TS has an enhanced model and more use cases. Level 1 (red): The user is communicating via SMS. It doesn't matter if the number of his contact is already in his contact list. As far as I know, SMS can be easily fabricated so it doesn't even matter if the user receives encrypted SMS, because the other party could be anybody, at least as long as there has been no verification of keys. So whether the user is communicationg via encrypted or unencrypted SMS, with the number in his address book or not, doesn't matter. The only possibility to communicate securely over SMS is to use TS with a verified contact, which would result in a green indicator. Level 2 (orange): This is for push messages that come from contacts in the usuer's address book which are not yet verified. Encryption is being used. EDIT: We should award SMS an orange indicator if there have been previous push messages and we already know that the key is connected to that number. In the case where a SMS reaches our phone from somebody unknown to us, this SMS will still have a red indicator. Level 3 (green): The user has verified the contact from his contact list and uses encryption. Discussion: Only one message colour for everything. Message colour doesn't resemble security any more, only the security indicator does. The message colour can be any colour we choose and it should be customizable in the future anyway. Though the colour should probably not be the green, orange or red of the security indicator so that people don't get confused. Also we need better contrast with the timestamp. The user can understand the security level with one glance at the security indicator. No locks, no verification badges and no transport symbols under the messages. No tiny symbols, that can't be ready by visually impaired people or won't be displayed correctly on lew-res screens. Colour-vision impaired people can still see which security level is being used. This leaves more room for what the user actually wants: communicating. I think we are too much in his face, constantly displaying something. Under each message there will only be a timestamp. I think there should be a warning message if a contact with two numbers (one of them isn't registered with TS) talks to the user and the security changes. Only switching to a red indicator probably doesn't cut it. Again, the indicator always tells you the security of your next message. If you want to know the security of your last messages, you will have to tap and hold on a message so that you can access message details. Not displaying transportation under each message might be unwise, because users who pay for SMS or Data depending on usage really want to know what TS is doing. I think the solution to this is asking the user at first start how TS should handle this. As far as I know this will be or already has been integrated into TS so we probably don't have to worry about it that much. This means either TS is not allowed to act in a way that would cost the user money or TS will ask the user what to do. The way of transportation will always be in sight, though, because the text in the message composing area will always display whether the next message will be a SMS or push message. The only thing that I would wish somebody would add is that I could allow TS to use SMS for 15min, a few hours or a day, but ask me again once this time is over. The paperlane doesn't have a lock anymore either. IV. Some ideas for security indicators This indicator needs to convey three levels of security and the user should always get the idea that more is better. Again, purely MS paint. This is taken from Google Chrome: This is the modified TS icon: Can anybody think of more? V. Conclusion Ok, this is the model I wanted to propose. Feedback is very welcome. It would also help a lot if somebody could just make new, more professional looking mockups of the screenshots.

		It'd be nice to be able to identify people by something other than a phone number. Not all my contexts have a phone number, or at least not one I know, but do have an email address, for example. Phone numbers are generally considered more sensitive than email addresses, and have the nice property that it is easy to have many of them, among others. This might also be an opportunity to think about fallbacks other than SMS, such as email.

		Hi, I had to restore TextSecure from a encrypted backup but experienced two issues: you cannot import a previous backup if you don´t create a new key. It always says the textsecure-password is invalid. A workaround is to create a dummy key (123456789) import your encrypted backup and reboot the phone. After the successful import of the backup I´ve noticed that my key has changed!!! Any of my contacts who had my key before the backup cannot decrypt my messages anymore. IMHO this needs a quick fix as it breaks all previously established communications with your contacts

		In many instances, after receiving a new message notification (with correct icon/notification), Textsecure will not present any further notifications/icons in the status bar/section, although the &quot;message received&quot; sound plays correctly.

		When I receive a group text and I reply, the message is also automatically sent back to me as well. Maybe there is a reason for inclusion, but would it be possible (and intelligent) to automatically remove one's own phone number when sending out a group message?

		This is just a tiny problem, but I guess I can't open half a ticket, so here it goes: When searching for app, you get some suggestions and usually they are pretty spot on, so you don't even have to click search. When searching for TextSecure with a phone localized to German, you get the suggestion &quot;TextSecure Privaten Messenger&quot;, which contains a typo. The correct phrase would be &quot;TextSecure Privater Messenger&quot;, which is already the title of the app. I don't know if play is caching an old and wrong version of the title, or if you can influence this phrase in any way. I just wanted to let you know that it'd be nice if we could fix it. It doesn't seem to be a local caching problem tough. I deleted the cache and all safed data of the play store app, but still got the same result.

		Hello, I have broken my old phone and now want to use textsecure with the new one but it won't let me, saying that my number is already in use with the broken phone, and asks to uninstall (which is impossible, as the phone is broken). FAQ says that I could generate new keys, but it was a no go. What can I do?

		Long press on a message containing a link / phone number. Click &quot;forward&quot;. Actual result - uses the text from the most recent message - not the one that I have selected. Expected result - use the message I have selected. Take this example: If I long press on &quot;Join LOL Chat&quot; and select &quot;forward&quot; TextSecure uses the message text from the last SMS (&quot;DFS&quot;). The same happens if I try to select &quot;Opera Thursdays&quot; - the &quot;DFS&quot; message is the one which is forwarded. This happens whether I'm the recipient or whether I'm the sender. If I send a message saying &quot;Alice's phone number is +447700900289&quot; I am then unable to select that message for forwarding if there is another message sent or received after it. Hope that makes sense. I just want the message I long press to be the one which gets forwarded :-)

		So I was just replying to a straight SMS and the conversation window was full of messages. After hitting the &quot;send&quot; button, I was wondering whether I made a mistake because I couldn't see the message I just sent. Turns out that it was there, just hidden as I needed to scroll down to see it. I was a bit confusing. Would it be possible to automatically scroll down in this situation so the newly sent message shows up right away?

		I am currently using TextSecure as my default SMS application but I wish I could divide my texts with sensitive data from my everyday texts. It is silly that I have to enter my secure password just to ask my friend &quot;what's up?&quot;, and if I leave my password cached after that then my sensitive texts are just as vulnerable as any other. I suggest that we partition the texts into two parts. The normal texts can be sent and received without requiring any passphrase, just like any other SMS client. But one must enter the passphrase before security keys are exchanged. Then that part of the conversation gets encrypted and set apart, only visible when the passphrase is entered. Has something like this been suggested by anybody else? I couldn't find it.

		After reinstalling my phone (changed to cyanogen), and restoring TextSecure from a backup (Helium Backup, not TS builtin backup) I could not receive any pushed Messages in TextSecure (SMS worked, though). A friend of mine suggested, that my &quot;GCM-ID&quot; changed due to the new OS. I deactivated and activated &quot;Push messages&quot; the registration process started anew and I can receive messages again. Sadly a new key was generated, so I now have to compare keys with all my contacts again. As generating a new key does not seem necessary in this particular situation, the user should be asked if he wants to generate a new key if a key already exists. // Updated with correct terms

		When you want to invite a contact, which has more than one mobile number to a group, you have to select one of his numbers, but there is no hint, which of the contacts numbers is registered with TextSecure. There is only a warning (MMS-group), if the other number is selected. TextSecure should give a hint, maybe a little lock symbol, to show which of the contacts numbers supports push messages.

If i create a group, the other people still get the message that i left the group, and i dont receive any of their Messages. However, if i send a message, it seems as if my phone joins the group, sends the message, and leaves the group again. Any ideas?

		Using the latest TextSecure on Android, sending regular SMSs works. However, sending and receiving push messages to and from the one friend that also has TextSecure does not work. What might be relevant is that I do not have a permanent data connection (only when I have WiFi). When she installed TextSecure, added her address book and sent me the first message, I was there with her but was not connected. We have, however, tried sending messages when both of us were connected, and they did not arrive either.

Same thing happened after reinstalling the app and trying again. Is there anything I can do to get the messages back? So far I couldn't find anything regarding this issue. Thanks in advance

		I think it would be useful to have a known (main) issues list. This would help to avoid headache if you try something that is known to be broken (sharing function) specially for new users (an the ones who are too lazy to search...) to avoid duplicate issues to show if someone is working on a fix (bad encrypted...) and reduce replies like &quot;@some_sample_body is working on that in brach XXX&quot; to show if something won't be changed (cropped contact photos ;-) ) Also have that list in play store? Maybe combined with a minimal road map showing the priority and planned fixes Is it possible to make an issue sticky or sth. like that?

		I have configured my TextSecure client so that it only sends msges via push when possible. When a friend of mine was abroad and he had roaming activated it came to the following incident: He sent me a regular SMS, I answered him with a push message, but he did not have his data connection activated while roaming. So he received the message a day later when he was back home. I had no way to realize he had not received the message on time, it tells &quot;Sunday&quot; on my client and &quot;Monday&quot; on his client.

		Hi, I am using HTC One S running CM 11 (Android 4.4.2) and cannot receive PUSH messages. WhisperPush is off in CM Settings and I am registered with the TS servers. I can send PUSH messages no problem and my friends receive them, but when they send me PUSH msg nothing happens. I have reinstalled and re-registered and there is no change. SMS works no problem, though. Any suggestions? Thanks

		I convinced a friend to start using TextSecure. This is what happened: I sent messages (SMS) with TextSecure. My friend installed TextSecure. I saw the key icon from my friend. I saw the key icon from myself sent to my friend I sent a few additional messages (the lock icon appeared, but still using SMS) I received a few messages (encrypted, via push) But now I cannot send messages anymore. The failed messages have an exclamation mark icon next to them. The details state: transport: SMS which look incorrect to me. Resending the messages gives the same problem. A log is uploaded to: http://hastebin.com/rokiwesufo Let me know if you need more details.

		When I get a text or use a direct message shortcut widget, a new conversation with the contact is opened. Over time this leads to multiple running conversations with the same contact, which makes the app a little sluggish. I can close running conversations by pressing the back button repeatedly. Is this behavior intended?

		My friend today had an issue when he installed textsecure for the first time. He had my number saved in his addressbook without the country code. (By the way, he is in a different country than me now). So thats why he didn't see me as a push contact, although i could send him messages. After updating my contact details in the addressbook he saw that i was having textsecure, but the conversation recipients weren't updated so that still he could not send me messages. even creating a new contact with the correct country code didn't help. In the end he ended up re-installing textsecure which finally worked. I hope that this is not a duplicate bug (i didn't find it yet, though I've only searched the first two pages) and i hope that the above text is not too confusing... zaibotw

		Quite often, I receive messages with a significant delay. In the message details of received messages the sent and received time are present. I would like to have an indication in the message how long it took between sending and receiving. Maybe this could be done by a colour coded hour glass icon in the received messages, e.g. yellow hour glass: delay between 10 seconds and 1 minute, red hour glass: delay more than 1 minute. I would like to have this in order to anticipate to the sender who might have expected me to reply earlier to the message.

		Unfortunately SMS messages can't be imported, when the sender have no phone number. However, in the standard Android App are messages included, where the phone number is the name of the company. For example my bank sends SMS messages with the number &quot;comdirect&quot; and there are many more companies like that. Is there any reason, why this messages can't be imported? I really want to use TextSeure, but I also don't wanna lose my existing SMS messages.

		When the new converstation button in TextSecure is used, a list of contacts which are in the phone's address book is displayed. When contacts in the phone's address book are known to use TextSecure, they are highlighted with green color and sorted on top of the remaining contacts. This however does not happen if the contacts are stored in the address book with a particular formatting. Different legal representations of a sample german phone number are given below: (1) +491701234567 (2) 00491701234567 (3) 01701234567 All those numbers are legal formatting options and work with TextSecure to receive and send messages. If a number is saved in the address book using option (2), TextSecure however refuses to detect that the user has TextSecure installed. A correct highlighting is therefore not provided.

Each time a SMS came in all three lit up. It is possible to disable this in the configuration of the google hangouts configuration, but it does this by default on install. I am unaware of the implications of this, if any, to TextSecure, but I thought I would bring it up to see if there was an awareness of it and if it has been addressed. I have not done extensive testing on this.

		Alice sends a push message to Bob. She does not get an error message so assumes it has been delivered. Bob does not receive any message. He has restored his phone from backup and everything else works, so why care? Both sync their contact list. Bob sends a push message to Alice. It is delivered correctly. Alice turns off data and sends an encrypted SMS message to Bob. It is delivered and readable. Alice and Bob compare keys. They match. Alice checks the debug log. It mentions that the message was not sent because Bob is not registered to the server. Bob un-registers and re-registers his phone. New keys are generated. Both sync their contact list again. Now push is working from Alice to Bob and vice versa. Questions: Why didn't Alice get a warning message when she tried to send a push message? Why wouldn't TS be able to receive push messages after restoring the phone from backup with all settings (Nandroid backup), but sending push messages works fine? Unfortunately I didn't save the stack trace, it was overwritten with subsequent attempts to resolve the problem. (Related to issue #678 but not a duplicate)

		After a conversation partner got a new phone and reinstalled TextSecure we could not establish a secure connection anymore. I disabled TextSecure (default for SMS, MMS, Push in preferences) and enabled it again. Since then secure communication via SMS works again. But i can't enable Push anymore. I get an &quot;SMS verification failed&quot; error. The number is correct. I tried different networks. Firewall and Privacy Guard are disabled / uninstalled. After several tries i tried registering WhisperPush. It worked immediately on the same phone. Meanwhile i manually unregistered from WhisperPush again. Any ideas?

		Hello, I have an issue with TextSecure. It seems to send messages fine, but no texts I receive are loaded into the database. I also had this problem with the SMS verification when I registered my phone number, the text was received, but TextSecture didn't recognise it. I had the same issue with RedPhone. Now when I receive a text, to load it into TextSecure I have to import it from the database, but Go SMS Pro and stock Messaging receive messages just fine. Not sure if I can receive encrypted messages yet since I don't know if I have any contacts who also use it. Not sure what I can do to test this... but I am happy to help test it out.

		(This might be an Android bug, not a TS bug but I've only seen it with TS) I have the latest Play store release of TS installed and have it configured as my default SMS app. I had TS import the existing message store and everything shows up in TS just fine. The app also appears to send and receive both SMS and MMS just fine for me. However, I noticed that if I send an SMS outside of TS, the message isn't shown inside TS (I assume because it writes to the default message store and not TS's). Example: if I use Google Now and say 'ok google, text my wife' and send her a text through this mechanism, the message is sent and the little card that pops up saying it was sent shows TS as the default messaging app and opens TS when you click it but the message I just sent is not shown in TS. If I make Hangouts the default app again temporarily then I see the message no problem. I also have an app called Agent that detects when I'm driving and responds to incoming SMS with an SMS of its own saying that I'm driving and that I'll contact them later. These messages also do not show up in TS, but become visible when I switch back to Hangouts. It would appear that TS uses its own message store for all messages and does not synchronize with the default Android message store after the initial import. I seem to recall another issue here on GitHub where someone was asking for an unencrypted message store and an encrypted one and after thinking about it, I think if TS would use the default message store for &quot;normal&quot; unencrypted SMS/MMS then that would solve both that request and the issue present here. I understand that makes the codebase more difficult though as there are two code paths accessing two different message stores.. Is my assessment of why the messages are not shown in TS correct? Is this by design? Can we rectify this? I just know that if I'd convinced my wife to use TS as her default app and then she couldn't find a message that she sent she'd never trust TS and would uninstall it in a heartbeat. If we're going to 'sell' our friends on TS as a 'drop in replacement' for whatever messaging app they currently use, it has to show all messages sent/received by them.

		I've been reading a lot of blog posts, reviews and user feedback about TS lately. At least in Europe many people really aren't comfortable with the fact that it's currently not possible to opt out of uploading all phone numbers to the TS server, myself included. This is also not something only the crypto nerds (I mean that in a very positive way!) complain about, but also many average users. Probably because it's one of the few things they really understand in the difficult landscape of privacy and security. And especially the uninformed are very anxious when they are asked to give all their contacts away. They wouldn't give their own number to any stranger on the streets and now they are supposed to give some strangers on the internet all of their friends numbers? The internet is the place where all the russian cybercriminals steal their money and evil smartphone apps are the way they get the TANs for the banking accounts, right? This argument is typically used in conjunction with something along the lines of &quot;they are using US(=NSA) servers, oh no!&quot;. The second complaint may not be of any factual difference for the safety of the messages in a good crypto system, but that doesn't matter. It's repeated over and over again in blogs and reviews. Allowing users to opt-out is one of the easier things we can do to make privacy-aware users happy (and kill the US-server argument once and for all). I am aware of https://whispersystems.org/blog/contact-discovery/ and WhisperSystems#692 and would like to discuss the possibilities we have to increase the privacy of the TS contact discovery process. It appears that we are currently waiting for the silver bullet to be discovered, which probably won't happen any time soon. Below I listed the simplest solutions I could think of, which appear not to be overly complex to implement, but still give a good balance between effort and privacy. If you have other/better proposals, I'm all ears! Allow the user to opt-out and download the whole bloom filter Allow the user to opt-out and download a subset of the bloom filter based on the country code of the contacts. Realistically most people don't have contacts from more than 1-3 countries. It's a little less private and people with contacts from India, China and the US won't be much better off data volume wise, but most users will. Allow the user to opt-out and manually upgrade to push from the settings menu. This would be typically only used if the user knows the contact to be registered. This doesn't leak any information about unregistered users to the server and is basically what Threema does iirc. If we end up using 1. or 2., updates could be provided with tiny daily/hourly builds. This way the client only needs to know the global/server time + age of his database and can grab only the updates he's missing. If somebody needs to try push messages with the friend that just installed TS, because he told him about this great and secure app, we simply allow the user to do the manual upgrade from 3. The privacy-minded users will sacrifice the 40MB+ volume or do it when they are on wifi. I know dozens of people who downloaded gigabytes of OSM maps for OsmAnd. When other identifiers like emails will be allowed (WhisperSystems#1085) we are obviously in for another ride. The easiest solution would probably be WhisperSystems#1259 and allowing the user to enter the identifier manually if they aren't in the same location. Email addresses could be imported from the Android address book and upgraded via 3. tough. The preferred &quot;privacy friendly&quot; setting should be preselected if WhisperSystems#838 will be implemented. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I'll appreciate all input!

		I have two TS clients, which were not able to communicate with 2.0.5. Every message was received as bad encrypted message (see WhisperSystems#1213 (comment)) I installed 2.0.6 on both devices and re-registered for the push service. I updated the push contacts on both devices. Receiving from and sending to other TS clients is working fine on both devices. But the bad encrypted message problem between these two TS clients persists. The same problem is described in WhisperSystems#1296 but the solution &quot;end/restart the encrypted session&quot; could not be applied, because password was disabled on one device and blank on the other. To be able to restart the session I enabled and set nonempty passwords and restarted the session, but the problem is still there.

		I had several issues where recipients did NOT receive a message that was sent via PUSH. The reason being that they had data disabled or a privacy app was blocking features that TS needed or the sync with the TS servers did not work. My suggestion is to send an acknowledge back to the sender via the PUSH data channel. If TS does not see an acknowledge within 2 minutes, TS would try to resend the message via SMS (if the fallback is enabled) or notify the user that the message did not go through. Messaging should be reliable AND secure!

		Hello, I got my whole family to use TextSecure but sometime after the last update a few issues turned up. One family member kept getting removed from our group (&quot;X has left the group&quot;) and re-adding her did not help. We also could not send her any messages (&quot;Error sending message&quot;). I decided to reinstall TextSecure on her phone (SGS4), after creating an encrypted backup. However, using the import feature, the old password was rejected and we couldn't get past the password prompt. Creating a new account with the old password and THEN importing the backup worked, for some reason, but all messages were unreadable. Randomly sending messages to other family members, she was able to re-exchange keys (despite importing the backup, she now had a new key/ID) with some people, but not with me, for example. I still can't exchange messages with her and I don't see any option to exchange keys again. So this is half bug report and half plea for help to get things working again...

		This last weekend I had an issue where every received unencrypted message would crash the textsecure app. It would say I had received an &quot;encrypted message&quot; when in fact it was not. I found this out by trying to open the message from the notification area. When I did, the textsecure password screen came up and when I entered the password, it would pause for several seconds (10-15) and then crash (I did file the reports, but one of those even crashed). Once I restarted the app, I could enter the password and read the text. At which point all was clear until I received another unencrypted text and the scenario would repeat itself. Only when I restarted the phone would the behavior stop and I haven't had it happen since. Sorry I don't have better initial steps to reproduce. If this is too hard to track down at all I totally understand but I did want to write this up to go with the crash reports you hopefully did receive. Would have been on Saturday afternoon USA Mountain time.

		Since 2.0.6 it seems there is no fallback from push to sms if the receiver is offline: Mobile 1 is online and tries to send a message to mobile 2. Both mobiles are registered for push. Message is sent via push, but mobile 2 doesn't receive the message because it's offline. Next time it get online it receives the message. Is this a bug or a expected behavior? Vice versa (mobile 2, offline --&gt; mobile 1, online) messages are delivered immediately via sms.

When a message contains a hyperlink, it can't be select by long pressing on the space next to it. Long pressing directly on the hyperlink opens the action window which asks, with which app you want to open the link and another window which asks, what do you want to do with the message. If you try to copy and paste (or share) the link, another message of the current chat gets copied and not the hyperlink.

The problem persist. The only fix we found so far: She has to disable push messages. And then enable it again.

		Heyho! I can successfully send and recieve push messages to resp. from other users but one: This very user registered her phone to the push service (is green in my contact list), but TextSecure seems to ignore this fact and insists on sending messages via SMS. The UI looks as if the receiving user doesn't have TextSecure installed, i.e. there is no lock symbol etc. I used to send SMS messages to this user via TextSecure, before this user installed it on her phone. Is there a way to convince TextSecure to use push? Deleting the existing conversation didn't help. http://hastebin.com/musugexido (I didn't find the phone number in the log, sending SMS works, however I disabled it for testing purpose)

		I posted this to the whispersystems mailing list, and was directed here. TextSecure keeps arbitrarily (not related to receiving any sms) launching it's unlock activity. This will completely interrupt a running application. Also, sometimes when I unlock my phone, the TextSecure unlock activity is showing, despite not having been active when I locked it. I captured a debug log immediately after this happened. http://hastebin.com/qetemaveyi Of note: I am running TextSecure 2.0.7 on Android 4.4.2 on a Samsung Galaxy Note3 on TMobile. Hope this helps.

		Long pressing the send button should reveal more options. I'm particularly interested in manual send as SMS while connected. Otherwise it's going through hoops to disable data/WiFi and back to the app. I mean sometimes people just don't have data plans and get my texts 7-8 hours later when at home on WiFi. Defeats the whole purpose of default SMS app option. Thanks!

		If I try to send an SMS to multiple people (using the group functionality, that is the only way I can find to do this) that are not using TextSecure, the program wants to send that as an MMS. My normal SMS program (stock one in PACMan ROM based on Android 4.2.2) allows sending this as SMS instead, by sending a separate SMS to each recipient. Given that I have 5000 free SMS per month but MMS cost a small amount of money per message on my carrier this is not an option for me. For now I uninstalled TextSecure until this issue can be fixed, this is a feature I can not live without.

		tl;dr I propose to add a clean &quot;registering a number by SMS to a different device&quot; step. User Story: As a new user, when I want to register my telephone number B (SIM card for number B temporary inserted into my mobile phone B) on my tablet A (a device without phone or SMS capabilities) with the TextSecure PUSH server, I have to enter the mobile number B into the TextSecure registration form on tablet A start the registration progress (my device B immediately receives (a first) 6-digit verification code SMS) [X] wait for the 2 minute time-out on tablet A (because A cannot receive the registration SMS) press the button on A for registration via an automated telephone voice call which now triggers the registration process by voice call to device B (user must be capable to understand a female voice, English language. This is a second and different verification code. Problem: Not everyone is able to understand the quite quickly spoken verification code on the phone. Not everyone understands the English message Users cannot enter the first verification code: because there is no possibility (no input form) in the current registration workflow Users have to know to wait for the timeout in order to trigger the &quot;sent me code by voice call&quot; process Observation: I regard the second SMS by voice as superfluous (in the standard case), because I already obtained a verification code on my device B at step [X], when I would only be able to enter this code on device A. @moxie0 I think the verification workflow should be deliberately modified which solves many issues: before starting the verification process at the device A, after having entered the telephone number, two new second buttons are proposed automatic registration (this is the present workflow with the silent SMS to the device where you press the button, but you have to enter the telephone (BTW: Can't this be fetched from the Android automatically?) new button: &quot;manual registration&quot; (a verification code is sent via SMS to the device with the entered number) new button: &quot;registration by voice call&quot; (you receive an automated telephone call on the device with the entered number, and a six-digit verification code in English will be presented) Advantages of my proposal: lower workload on TS registration server (the second SMS is not necessary, this step after the 2-minute-timeout is obsolete in the case that the user can receive the verification code on their second device) time saving: the user does not have wait for the 2-minute timeout easier: no need to understand the English voice message verification code text message (SMS) could be i10n/i18n

		Open textsecure Press &quot;+&quot; to create a new conversation. Tap home key to do some other activity. Long-press home key. Notice contact list with phone numbers showing. Probably not the end of the world but typically the app shows a blank screen for security purposes and this current behavior didn't fit what I thought was the current paradigm. My feelings won't be hurt if this gets closed our anything. Just hoping to help ferret out the bugs. Long live Textsecure!

		Hello guys Thanks for this great app! Very useful! Ummm, it would be great if TextSecure asks for the passphrase asap after rebooting the phone. Sometimes I forgot to unlock it and do not receive any messages for hours which is not so good ... Any ideas?

		This all started because TextSecure had shown an incoming picture message of a picture I had sent a friend a few days earlier from a number I did not recognize. After doing some digging I got the idea to double check my phone records to see if TextSecure had received this message via push or SMS. What I found was extremely odd because my carrier usage showed that I had sent the picture message to this random number. The reason I speculate this image has come from TextSecure local database is because I had deleted the picture, from my SD card, after I had initially sent it. There does also appear to be an issue with my TextSecure local database because I tried to send the same friend a picture of my usage summary and after the send button was pressed the picture swapped to a picture he had previously sent me in our conversation. Although it showed the incorrect picture on my end he reported the correct picture did however make it to him. I have attached my original screenshots that show the incoming picture message, an outgoing message from me, and my usage report showing that both messages were in fact outgoing.

The only way to switch off sound is to have a sound file that contains no sound at all. Rename the current Sound widget to Sound file. Add a Sound checkbox above and use it to gray/ungray the Sound file widget. Aka: Sound        [ x ]

		This is so bizarre I didn't know how to explain it properly in the title. Right now I have this text in the phone number field at the top of a thread in textsecure: &quot;+1510xxxxxxx - Sms and and generally use the&quot; (The xxxxxxx are actually 7 digits I just omitted them to preserve his privacy) This text should NOT be in a field meant for a telephone number! How did this happen? Well, I got a text from someone that went through my google voice number and was telling me they had a new number so I tried to copy just the number google puts there at the beginning of the text but It copied the whole text. I went into their address book entry and cleared their old number field to replace with the new data. When I pasted I noticed there was a bunch of text after the number so I cleared it all except the number then saved. I'm not sure if i saved the text by accident then edited it again or... maybe i saved the number that it was relayed to first then finally the proper number (not the google voice relay number)... it is a blur in my mind. When I went back into TextSecure instead of their number under their name I saw part of the text message in there. So bizarre. The google voice is ANOTHER google account pointing to my number, not the one that holds the address book on my phone. This number was copied from the text that is placed their automatically by google voice, he didnt add his number to the text himself. I don't know if that matters. I have deleted any thread from him in textsecure and started new ones. I have restarted my phone. I have deleted and created a new contact for this friend in my google address book, both on my phone and in a web browser which then syncs with my phone. I have deleted the whole thread from the other google voice account. I also tried renaming the contact in my address book... nope. Every time I get a new text from him or start a new thread to him this same bad string is in the phone number field under his name. No matter what I do it won't go away. It doesn't matter if I am connected to wifi or not (I have no data plan)... This makes me assume this data is stuck in a textsecure database somewhere. Why is the data in the contact phone number field not just retrieved from the address book on the phone at some regular intervals or at startup? Why is textsecure holding it forever in some table? The table must be associating a number to a number string... but why? Why not just use the actual number?? I notice that some contact number strings have a +1 in front of the number (USA international code) and some do not even though NO CONTACTS in my address book have this +1... so textsecure has a strange way of handling this data. How does it decide what to make this string? There are errors in this function. My suggestion is to retrieve this data from the phone address book and store it or maybe refresh it every time the password is entered or every week or something. I don't know the programming aspect... Thank you!

		This happened to me on both my phone and my wifes phone: After flashing a new ROM and restoring Textsecure messages from an encrypted backup, there is a problem with push messages (can't be received or sent, I don't remember which). This can be fixed by re-registering for push-messages, but since there is no indication that messages don't get through this can be a real problem for people when they change they phones and want to take their messages with them.

I received a regular SMS from TextSecure (+1 412-212-8916) with a verification code. What do I do with it? I couldn't find on TextSecure a place to enter it. And I couldn't find a reference to verification code in the TextSecure documentation either. Thank you Gustavo F.

		Hi, I'm living in a country where you do not have a permanent internet connection. When you send a message to another TextSecure user while you are online, all further messages will be delivered via internet. If my internet connection drops, and my partner sends a message to me, I won't get it until I'm back online. I would request a feature on the senders phone (online), which checks with the server if the push message was delivered after a certain amount of time (e.g. 5 minutes). If it was not received by the receiver, a notification in the NotificationBar should pop up, which asks the sender if he/she wants to resend the message via SMS. I would love to implement this feature on my own, but before doing that I'd like to hear your comments! Regards, sternze

		I restored TextSecure using TitaniumBackup on my new phone and after de-registering and re-registering push I was able to communicate with most contacts. However I still got &quot;Bad encrypted message...&quot; from one contact. I needed to &quot;End Secure Session&quot; with this contact, after that it started to work.

		I am not aware of individual countries' rules and regulations; however, on their control list page ( http://www.wassenaar.org/controllists/index.html ) there's this document: http://www.wassenaar.org/controllists/2013/WA-LIST%20%2813%29%201/02%20-%20WA-LIST%20%2813%29%201%20-%20GTN%20and%20GSN.doc Controls do not apply to &quot;technology&quot; &quot;in the public domain&quot;, to &quot;basic scientific research&quot; or to the minimum necessary information for patent applications.
 The document further elaborates: The Lists do not control &quot;software&quot; which is any of the following:
1.  Generally available to the public by being:
    a.  Sold from stock at retail selling points without restriction, by means of:
        1.  Over-the-counter transactions;
        2.  Mail order transactions;
        3.  Electronic transactions; or
        4.  Telephone call transactions; and

    b.  Designed for installation by the user without further substantial support by the supplier;
Note    Entry 1 of the General Software Note does not release &quot;software&quot; controlled by Category 5 ‑ Part 2 (&quot;Information Security&quot;).

2.  &quot;In the public domain&quot;; or

3.  The minimum necessary &quot;object code&quot; for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking) or repair of those items whose export has been authorised.
 IANAL, but that sounds to me like TextSecure (and any other public domain/open source software project) ought to be exempt from cryptography export controls.

For some apps I like, I could integrate them according to &quot;the right way&quot; on http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_adding_your_own_app but unfortunately, I cannot manage that for TextSecure. Could you please at some time address this issue, so that one can compile TextSecure from search when building an own Android? I like cutting edge systems built from GitHub sources and this can help you also with more nightly / beta-testing. Thanks a lot!

Then, from the Nexus 4, I attempted to attach an image to send it to the Moto G. The image is sent and received correctly, but the preview thumbnail in the originating Nexus 4 phone (and only there!) is from a different image that I had received or sent previously in the deleted thread. From the Moto G I don't see the same problem.

		I have installed TextSecure for many of my friends recently, and have found on phones without a hard/soft menu button on the phone (which results in the vertical &quot;...&quot; on the top-right of most apps for replacement) do not have the unlocked padlock icon from which to initiate a key exchange. Once I established a key exchange from my phone which has a soft menu button, however, the locked padlock icon appears to discontinue the secure session. I have found this to be true on any android phone lacking the hard or soft menu buttons. If a specific example is required, the most recent phone I found this to be an issue on was the HTC Desire.

		one needs to touch the &quot;phone&quot; icon to get to the screen where one can add a new contact for a sender phone number (e.g. after one got a msg from that sender). this is bad because of 2 reasons: a) there is no connection between &quot;i want to add this contact&quot; and a &quot;phone&quot; icon (which usually means &quot;call the person&quot;) b) one might not want to call the other person and therefore would not even touch the icon because you do not know if that immediately triggers an outgoing voice call (and thus you never find out that adding the contact is on the next screen)

		It would be nice to be able to send a message to multiple numbers without having to use the group function. If it is just for one message I should not need to create a new group. edit: I just realized I cannot send messages through groups at all, if there is one person not using TextSecure. My provider/contract does not support MMS. So I am not able to use TextSecure for sending multiple messages without copy and pasting the content to every person -_-

		I installed text secure based off a recommendation by a friend. I realized most of my contacts don't use this service so I uninstalled it. I now have two contacts that use text secure , and whenever they attempt to text me I get a unreadable message. Like this : HHJABBAOOIWHAHS3123191362ASAIHASBSD814612401246+KABQIWRB7579127. It is not a HUGE deal but its quite a hassle , for them and for me, to constantly remind them that they cant use text secure when messaging me. I assume that since I used to use TextSecure , that somehow it is still thinking that I can receive secure messagaes ? Even after uninstallation? ( Clarification : I can message Textsecure users , and they receive &quot; Hey , how are you&quot; , however when they respond all I receive is &quot; KAKSHHAO+89HABIFUBIWOH+AISHBASFIUASF&quot; , when in reality they said &quot; I'm good how are you&quot;) I have done alot of research and I was told that sometimes it takes the developers some time to * unregister* phone numbers ; however it has been over 2 months. Any ideas or suggestions would be immensely helpful!

		Hi, I installed TextSecure yesterday and came across an irregular behavior on the multitasking screen on my Nexus 4, running Android 4.2.2. Steps to reproduce: Open TextSecure plus two other random apps Go to the mutitasking screen Swipe one of the two random apps to the right. This is what happens: the app is removed from the list, the list stays open (expected behavior) Now swipe TextSecure to the right (one other app still has to be in the list) Result: TextSecure is removed from the list and the multitasking screen is closed immediately. Expected behavior: Usually, the multitasking screen would remain open until the last app has been removed. Furthermore, if I want to re-access the multitasking screen directly after it has been closed( by removing TextSecure from the list), it does not react - I have to wait around three seconds before the multitasking button starts reacting again.

		As someone whith a limited amount of free sms per month it would be great to have a statistic of how many sms I send in the last month, or something similar. Normally I would use an additional app for this, but since TextSecure has it's own storage for sms (which is great, because it's encrypted) those apps won't work. I know that this isn't a high priority feature but it would still be great to have it. Kind regards David.

		This might not be a very useful issue, since I'm recalling what happened from memory, but it was bad enough to be reported I think. I lost around 3 months of text messages. Yesterday I was trying to send a push text to another TS user. After hitting the send button a dialog appeared below the message bubble saying something like &quot;click here for insecure fallback mode&quot;. I had never seen this before and was reluctant to send an insecure message so I ignored it and tried again, same dialog. I don't recall what I did next to try to remedy the situation, I might have force closed textsecure, I'm not sure. But when I returned to the list of messages, all the contact names where &quot;anonymous&quot;, but the icon for each thread looked correct. I then tried to create a new text message to myself, this brought up a text thread for a completely different person. I realized something was very wrong, so I decided to export my text messages and reinstall textsecure. I did this, and was not able to import the encrypted database. Once it just said &quot;bad password&quot;, once it allowed me to, but all of the texts read &quot;bad encrypted message&quot;. I should also add that I have not been able to &quot;register&quot; with textsecure again through sms. I click register and the text never comes. However the calling method works. I hope this is helpful.

Except when I'm typing to her I see X/60 at the bottom. Rather than splitting up the text at 160 chars it tries to split it at 60 characters. She's the only contact I have that does this. the rest still do 160 characters. I'm running the latest version on the Play Store. If I need to supply any additional debug info I can.

		Ver 2.0.8 on Android 4.4.2. Believe relatively new problem. Displayed TXTs show a timestamp of +1 hour in the message list. When I look at message details, received TXTs have a sent time around an hour in the future. The received time looks correct. Does not seem to correlate/change with senders timezone. Re-searched after posting and see some other that imply 'Sent time' is merely displaying what the carrier presents. Is my carrier merely using a +1 timezone from my local, so this expected? Is there a reason the received time isn't displayed in the message list? Definitely arguable, but displaying received seems like a reasonable default.

There should be an option in the long-press menu of a thread and in the extra options menu in the in-thread view to add a number to your contacts. Currently you have to write the number down, then add it to your contacts manually.

		I have a problem. Since I installed TextSecure, when I use my phone's default &quot;People&quot; application to add new contacts, they are not displayed. The application saves them, but doesn't display them anywhere. When I open TextSecure though, there they are. So TS can see those new contacts, but the &quot;People&quot; app (which created them) can't. After changing some (may I say random?) settings I managed to fix it. However my friends have the same problem. Please fix it, it's frustrating and I can't get regular people to use it if they encounter problems like this :/ Thank you. p.s.: I'm sorry if it's a known bug, I tried to search for similar posts but couldn't find anything

		To select a normal message I can hold anywhere on or beside the message. But if the message contains a link or linked number, then nothing happens if I hold beside the text. If I hold a linked number the dialog shows up but then my phone will open the dial dialog and when I come back the &quot;select menu&quot; is closed again. So the only choice for me to select a message that contains a &quot;linked&quot; number is to hold on a non-linked part of the text (which is quite difficult for messages like &quot;1000&quot;). Can this be reproduced/fixed? Also is there a way to better detect whether a number should be &quot;linked&quot; at all?

		I've installed TS, and until a few minutes ago I was unable to send any kind of PUSH message, it was defaulting to SMS, all the time. Admittedly there is only one contact in my list that I can use TS with. The app wasn't recognizing this contact as a TS user, it appeared in the list of TS users, but I could only send SMS (which failed right away because I disabled the SMS send function from the options). From what I can tell the problem is that when I exchanged my identity with this contact (over SMS) I didn't have the international prefix included in his number (he's from another country). This created an entry within my SMS database with that number. After installing TS and being unable to send PUSH messages I noticed this and added the international prefix. Nothing changed and I was still unable to send messages. Upon sending more messages I noticed that at the top of the window, next to the contact name there was still the old number without the prefix. At first I thought this was a display issue, but then I cleared the app's data, redid the initial setup but SKIPPED the SMS import procedure. This fixed the problem. Without any previous SMS to take the number from, the app took it from the contact list (or at least that's what I assume has happened) and of course took the right one. I can now send PUSH without any problem and at this point importing the SMS db worked fine and kept the correct number. I hope this help somebody and can be fixed. Cheers

		I have a contact with Textsecure who at one point fell back to SMS during a conversation. My &quot;phone&quot; is a wifi only device and currently receives SMS via Google Voice, so this didn't work. I sent him a message saying I can't fall back to SMS and disabled it on my side, and then got one or two from him later saying that he couldn't restart a secure session. I also got a couple &quot;secure session ended&quot; messages and the &quot;send&quot; UI element turned to the green (should be red, IMO) unlocked one. Now, with network connectivity good, every message I send results in &quot;Error sending message!&quot; with absolutely no additional useful information as to WHY there was an error, WHAT the error was, and WHAT I may do to correct it. There is no UI element to restart a secure session. It doesn't exist, or at least, I can't find it in 5 minutes of searching, which means for all practical purposes it doesn't exist. Thinking to &quot;reset&quot; the state between my contact and myself, I selected &quot;delete thread&quot; and erased our prior messages. He then DISAPPEARED FROM MY CONTACT LIST (wtf?) and, despite having an identity key still in my contact keys, there's no way to re-add him. Once I stumbled upon the send message dialog (still with the green unlocked UI element) somehow - no idea how. Otherwise, it's impossible. I can't add him using his number, or directly from contacts. I rebooted the phone and still can't add him from contacts or by using his number in +1xxxxxxxxxx format. I'll file separate UI bugs, but this is the whole story.

		I've deleted a thread from a contact and now he's gone from what I consider the &quot;main&quot; screen (my list of conversations). Using either his number or name, I can't add him back to Textsecure (and shouldn't have to). I still have his key in my contact keys, so, wtf. Problem discovered as a subset of #1583.

		What it says on the tin. This was always one of the biggest pain points with OTR. &quot;Secure session ended,&quot; or in OTR's case, something like &quot;your contact has disabled encryption. you should disable encryption on your side.&quot; You're a computer. How about you do it and provide me with a big warning box? In Textsecure's case, tapping &quot;secure session ended&quot; does nothing. Okay, now what? It should either offer to restart the session or, if doing so is for some reason inadvisable, explain that, and explain to the user what to do next.

		I'm running TS 2.0.8 on Android 4.3 (Omega Rom v58 with Boeffla Kernel 5.3Beta5 on a Samsung I9300). I've TS configured to handle secure messages only (see http://abload.de/img/ts1eksfv.png and http://abload.de/img/ts2kxpzr.png) Last night I've got an encrypted (transport SMS, message colored grey) message from an unknown number (not in phonebook, don't know it at all). The session itself doesn't have the padlock and I only see the received message as &quot;Message encrypted for non-existing session&quot; with the padlock. When answering I've only unencrypted SMS (green arrow, padlock open) as choice so it seems that also the key exchange didn't happen. There is also no key for this number within &quot;Manage Identity Keys&quot;. I've created a contact with this number before asking back (unencrypted sms) who is writing from this number.

		I usually communicate with a friend of mine using textsecure, but she is out of country and has no internet connection at the moment. is it possible for me to write an (unencrypted) sms to her instead of a textsecure message, without changing my default settings in textsecure? i could not find such an option in the app. for the moment i just use another sms app for sending, but this seems not to be an optimal solution for this problem. my suggestion would be a context menu option when sending a message, where one can chose to send an sms just this once (with an appropriate warning maybe). in my opinion, the combined push/sms usage of textsecure fails to work for traveling people right now

		I am using TextSecure as my default app for text messages. However, there is a difference between TextSecure and other apps like my phones default or Hangouts: Using Hangouts or the default app of my phone, I can still access my messages via bluetooth. Third party apps like droidstats or airdroid are able to see the Messages and count them. Using TextSecure, droidstats does not &quot;see&quot; me sending messages and accessing my messages via Message Access Profile (Bluetooth) or Airdroid only yields messages of the time before I started using TextSecure. So I believe that TextSecure stores messages differently, though I don't know what the difference is and if it might be a design-decision (e.g. for security reasons). I see that those third-party apps would probably only work with unencrypted messages, but that would be fine for me. tl;dr: Is it possible to make messages sent and received by TextSecure available in the same way as &quot;the default apps&quot; do? I.e. that they are accessible via MAP or third-party apps, even though some of them might be encrypted. Disclaimer: I've not developed any app for android, so I have very little knowledge about how things work here and if there is a uniform way to store text messages.

		Friend of mine told me over email he also uses TextSecure. I added his int'l phone number as a contact on my phone and then attempted to send him a message via TextSecure. 1st message I tried sending: Shows up as green/SMS - is not actually sent, gives me pop-under &quot;Tap for insecure fallback&quot;. I did not take the offer. Logs: http://hastebin.com/newuhiwaha 2nd message I tried sending: Shows up as blue/PUSH - but is never actually sent (dark blue, no timestamp). TextSecure crashed immediately after I hit the &quot;send&quot; arrow. Logs: http://hastebin.com/okinuwimeq 3rd message I tried sending: Exactly same behaviour as previous. Immediate crash. Logs: http://hastebin.com/usalowafus At this point I tried the option &quot;Refresh PUSH directory&quot; but it didn't seem to help - next message I tried sending to this new contact was followed by an identical crash. Now, two days later, I can communicate with this person just fine over PUSH, no crashes. I hope the logs give you something to go on. Let me know if I can provide any further info. Thanks a bunch for TS!

		When in a group chat someone sends two consecutive messages, the application displays two different bubbles with the text of each message, and displays the name of the contact twice. This takes away a lot of space, especially if you don't have a huge screen. It would be nice if the messages were merged into the same bubble, so to save some space. Thank you!

		Hi, I have a problem. Since I installed TextSecure, I can't edit my contacts any more. Let me explain. If I use the phone's default app to edit the name/surname of a contact (which I save on my sim card), and then reboot the phone, all the edits are gone. This started happening after I installed TextSecure, for some reason. It's obviously very annoying and it's kind of driving me crazy. Please fix it. Thank you

		Hej there, Today I accidentally killed my TextSecure app and after restarting and unlocking it a bunch (a lot of them, actually) of messages were missing. I think this should be all messages I received after unlocking it for the last time. Do they get written to the database only if the app is shut down correctly? Were are they in the meantime?

		It would be very nice to have less obvious way of notifying about incoming message. Now there's an information on status bar saying that there is a encrypted message with sender's name. Less obvious would be to be able to disable status bar message at all but to keep LED blinking and/or sound. As an alternative - changing status bar notification text to some simple icon would do the trick too. The icon would be more discreet than the whole notification text.

		Hi, I had to migrate my textsecure messages (export encrypted backup), but since I didn't have the time to migrate right after the backup I used textsecure for another week and did a new data export. When I tried to import the backup afterwards I first had some issues getting it unencrypted (but it finally worked), but the main problem is: all messages between the first backup and the second backup are gone! I guess textsecure doesn't manage to overwrite previous backups when trying to make a new one! Please fix it even though my messages will probably remain lost...

		After my TS was stuck with incoming invisible messages, which stopped me from sendin and receiving anything (will open another bug for this), i exported an encrypted backup, then wiped the ts data from the android apps settings, when opening ts i entered a new (the same as before) password and imported the backup. All looked perfect at the first glance... just all my messages were unable to decrypt, plus those lost messages were in the right senders bin, but marked as not belonging to any conversation... Is there a way to restore this backup with all the messages decrypted? The crap is, that also a plaintext backup doesnt restore. I think there exists a closed bug that might fit about some unicode issues. I would be quite happy, if i could get my data back! Ts is latest from play store on a samsung i9070 on JB 4.1.2.

		I searched but could not find an issue about this. The 6 letter number you are told when using the &quot;confirmation by call&quot; for the push registration is only said once. Unless you know that beforehand and write it down quickly or if you have a good talent of quickly memorising the numbers you are in a bad situation and will probably need to toggle another call. Please make the numbers be repeated at least once so slower people have a change of using that service successfully. Or announce them slower.

		Similar but I believe not technically identical to #1533. Have two numbers: SIP and SIM. Bind Textsecure to the SIP number. Send a encrypted SMS via Textsecure. This will use the SIM number.

Nonetheless SIP is becoming more and more popular eg. with CyanogenMod having it integrated by default.

		I have a samsung s I896 captivate, firmware 2.2 (okay so it's a bit older) and the app says it is incompatible with my phone. The RedPhone:Secure Calls app works fine though. Am I SOL? I'd love to be able to use this app since many of my contacts are using it now. thanks!

		Since the last update of TextSecure (2.1.1) I noticed something &quot;extrage&quot; but I thought was an optical illusion at first but I confirmed this. In the notification bar, you can see the message whithout encryption, in older versions the message was &quot;Encrypted Message&quot; now it showed the message in plain text. I erased the content of the message but as you see is a long message, is not encrypted and was shown in plain text in the notification bar but when I clicked the message... It's suppose to be blocked by password... Hope you could fix this issue...

		My phone was off while several messages were posted to a group conversation of textsecure users. (I know because one of my other devices using a different textsecure account is a participant in the group as well.) When I turned my phone back on, the messages were not pushed to it. Effectively, my phone missed out on part of the conversation because it was turned off. Is that by design, or is that a bug?

		Okay, this is going to be a bad ticket without much detail, but I feel the obligation to document in at least some form. I have data, Jenny does not (I think). We've exchanged keys before and authenticated. At some point in the last couple months her phone stopped receiving any text secure messages from my phone, whereas I continue to get her messages. This does not occur between my phone and anyone else, but we did some experiments together on the two phones and were unable to get ours to work. Anyway, Lilia, you should poke at Jenny's phone the next time you're at Sudoroom. / halfassed bug report

		Until version 2.0.8 there was the lock symbol in the headline over the chat, where you could start a encrypted sesssion. Now since 2.1.0 the lock symbol is only in encrypted chats. Is it unnecessary bacause TS starts an encrypted push session automatically? And also encrypted sms? Or is it a bug?

		I'm not really sure if this is really a bug, but it looks for me like one. If I type in a secure SMS the maximal lenght is 60 characters. If that is exceeded multiple SMS are send (as far as I know). But if I write a TextSecure message the same limit of maximal characters is shown. To me, it looks a little bit strange to have such a low limit on the lenth of push messages. Or is it maybe a bug with my phone/android version in special? Phone: Xperia Arc S with Android 4.0.4

		Right now you have to choose, whether you want an enter button or the smileys-button on your keyboard. I've read some comments in the German Google play store, that people would like both possibilities (me included). I think an elegant solution to this would be, if both buttons are still in the keyboard, so we don't use space in the writing section like whatsapp. The functionality could work like this: With this feature there would also be no need for the section &quot;input settings&quot;. I don't know, if this was discussed earlier, I'm sorry if that is the case, but I couldn't find any issues concerning that feature.

		I recently downloaded and installed TextSecure because of, what I've heard, it's ease of use and security. But now that I have it installed on my phone I realised everything doesn't seem to work as easy as I thought for a newbie user as myself. My main problem is that for the moment, it seems like the TextSecure app can't recognise who among my contacts is a registered TS (push) user. I know at least one of my (international)friends is but when I tap on her number and want to send a message through data the only option that shows up is nonencrypted sms. Also, when I untick the box for sms to non-TS users non of the contacts are displayed when I tap the + icon. Is there something I have to do before I can send messages through data except registering for push or is there something I'm missing? Is there supposed the be some kind of notice if you send over data or via sms at all before you actually send the message and green/blue bubble shows up? I'm running the 2.1.1 version of the app on a G3, I went through the installation process without problems and have registered for push. I had to uninstall and then reinstall the app twice though because the app didn't recognise my password after I locked it. The timed lock feature seems to be broken too because after the set time no password is needed to unlock the app, not sure if that has anything to do with my problem but I thought I should mention it anyway. I'm pretty sure my friend is also running the 2.1.1 version.

		I sometimes have problems sending text message (sms). Sometimes the reason appears to be that the message is to long. When I split it, it then works, But this does not always appears to be the reason.

		Textsecure allows you to set a message limit for conversations, similar to stock messaging apps. However, stock apps let you &quot;lock&quot; a message to prevent its automatic deletion when the conversation hits the defined limit. I would like to see this in textsecure, so then I can lock messages instead of saving the entire conversation.

		There is contact X and contact Y using TextSecure. X and Y used to send each other TextSecure messages but recently, things changed. X can still send TextSecure messages to Y. Y can receive them but is not given the possibility to send back TextSecure messages to X (the interface is offering secure SMS). The following is the story about how I fixed it and probably also contains the cause of the error: After searching for a while I noticed the following on Y's phone: When pressing &quot;+&quot; to start a new conversation, X was presented as TextSecure User with his phone number +49170854----. After clicking on the contact item of X, the conversation view opened and now on the top of the screen the was X name and below his phone number +490170854---- (note the additional 0 after the country code). Now I searched the phones local phone book for that number. It was quite a mess with the +49170-number being part of at least two contacts. And then I found the +490170-number, which was part of a Skype-contact and could not be edited. I asked X to delete the additional 0 from his Skype-account. Then I deleted the local Skype-contact entry in Y's phone book. After I cleared data and cache of TextSecure on X's device and on Y's device and re-registered both to the TextSecure push-service, everything worked again. Debug logs (a bit messy): X's phone: http://hastebin.com/iwipawemob Y's phone: http://hastebin.com/xakubapiro

So I wonder if they are deleted, already fetched or still in queue? Logs are error-free. I can provide the sending and receiving numbers to moxie.debug@whispersystems.org.

Concerning one user, I got a notification (that I cannot remember) indicating a problem delivering the invitation. The current situation is as follows: This user is listed among the group members, such that I cannot add him again. The user never received an invitation and can therefore not see / join the group. Obviously, the user can not leave the group, such that I cannot add him again. I have a couple of suggestions here :) It would be good if at least the creator of the group would be able to delete users from the group (also useful in case a wrong user was accidentally added). It would also be great to be able to resent the invitation (this could be done automatically possibly?) Thanks, Tobi

		Every time I have multiple apps displayed in my &quot;recent apps&quot; and swipe away TextSecure, the &quot;recent apps&quot; view closes (crashes), even if the &quot;list&quot; is displaying more recent apps. To view my recent apps again, I have to press the &quot;recent apps button&quot; twice instead of once. This only happens when swiping away Text Secure, not with other apps. I have version 2.1.4 installed, but the same thing happened with previous versions. Nexus 5, Android 4.4

		Hello, I am a huge supporter of securtext, I simply have a suggestion to make. I think its important to be able to clear screen or burn certain messages after the other person has viewed them. If its a secure conversation it will inusure the sender that the reciever would not be able to show anyone at a later date.

		Hello, It's the second time i post something here so i don't really how the thing goes but i got several thing i would like to adress regarding the app. If i need to open several thread i will :) Usually i don't experience problem with push message but at the moment one of my contact is in China ( i'm in europe) and it appear quite often that messages are delayed (in comparison to whatsapp). The second problem is that when the message is finally delivered - 5-15 minute later- the order is mixed up (eg: a message sent at 12:00 will be after one sent at 12:01). I believe it is more server sided and a connectivity problem but i wanted to address it even though i have no proposition to fix that. There is a total non-sense in the UI with a sliding panel on the left and the option menu. In my sense they should be only one; lets say the sliding menu as it's trendy at the moment hence the option button could trigger the slide. I could be nice to have the media button directly in the conversation ( e.g: next to the lock) and not in the menu. Regarding media again i have only access to the gallery not the camera ( but might be my cellphone the problem ). Hence it could be more comfortable to share &quot;stuff&quot; if there was a camera option next to the gallery one. 5)Still regarding the media; I saw it has been already noticed but as it hasn't changed since.... : pictures compressions are too heavy. I understand that bandwidth is expensive but the picture are not &quot;readable&quot; like that. I think that's all and hope i wasn't too negative as i really enjoy the app :) regards,

		This is just an idea for your plans to merge RedPhone and TextSecure into Signal. The way SAS and key continuity are used to verify identities in ZRTP are much more user friendly than identity verification in TextSecure (QR codes, etc). By folding both apps together, as it seems to be your plan, maybe you could reuse identity verification from &quot;RedPhone&quot; for &quot;TextSecure&quot;?

		Hi, after having much fun with TextSecure for a long time it stopped working today. The visual issues are: 1.) when I send a PUSH/secure SMS message it stays in status pending. Insecure messages can be sent and received. 2.) when I restart my phone before entering the TextSecure passwd I see a notification of TextSecure &quot;4 new messages&quot;. After login to TextSecure test messages from other users are not shown 3.) In Android System Info Pro I see that the TextSecure process runs at 50 %. The battery is drained by TextSecure and the phone heats up significantly. 4.) TextSecure UI is very slow. All new encrypted messages Push or secure sms only show &quot;Decrypting, please wait...&quot; but that are never displayed in clear text. Any hint how what I can do to make it working again?

I don't have any other sms-app installed (not even the standard one). I receive messages on every other messaging app (whatsapp, telegram, threema, skype). Normal/encrypted SMS are received fine through TextSecure. Text Messages aren't received at all.

			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		Currently, when a new device is set up this disables any old ones, presumably to increase security. However, due to how this is handled in details this IMHO has pretty serious security implications: It makes it much easier to take over an account for prolonged periods. If someone gets access to the SIM for even just a second they can connect to that phone number. They then will receive messages directed to that number. The legitimate user will however not be warned of this in any way. He will get generic &quot;sending failed&quot; messages. Worse, if encrypted SMS fallback is enabled, he might not even notice anything is wrong. The recipient will get these messages, but they will not be decrypted, thus making it even easier for the attacker to appear legitimate. Even if the user figures out that someone took over his account, there is no obvious way to fix this. The only one I could figure out is clearing app data, however then he loses his private key and the people he communicates with have no reason to trust him over the attacker. It makes it impossible to securely and with little effort switch to a new device. Normally this would be done by distributing a hash of the new private key via the old trusted channel. However before linking the new device its private key/hash is not known (I have not tried if skipping linking a phone number at first would be possible and help), whereas once the linking is done the old device can't be used to distribute the new hashes.

		Auto delete messages I'd like to request that feature again because many people already requested it in some issues, but there were some privacy concerns and it could be interesting to talk about them and maybe, after finding a good solution, to implement the feature! ;) So the idea is that messages automatically get deleted from the phones somehow. The suggestion that someone could delete the message from all phones remotely let some privacy concerns come up as you should have full control about which messages get deleted from your phone and which do not... Another idea (what I do appreciate) is the option to disable history like it's possible on hangouts (messages get deleted after some time automatically). For example messages get automatically deleted 24 hours after you read them. This could be an option in the conversation itself and you get the message &quot;history turned off&quot;. Every participant should have the option to turn it off/on and it applies for all the participants. Like that there's no confusion and all people in the conversation should be happy with this solution and can turn it on/off like they want to do. The messages should of course have another color if history is turned off ;) I do like this feature, the only privacy concern could be that you can still capture screenshots of it, but maybe taking screenshots could generally be disabled in the app or you get a notification that someone took a screenshot (what should be possible somehow because it works on snapchat e.g., too, right?). Do you think this would be possible or do you have some other concerns? Is such a function too hard to implement or would you even like that feature? :)

		Hi, how can I maintain my fingerprint after a wipe and reinstall of my Android phone? It seems that I can import my messages, but TextSecure is giving me a new fingerprint. Is there some way to export/maintain it?

		Hi, I got a message (via push, i.e. by a sender using TextSecure with encryption), that makes TextSecure take a long time to open or scroll over the senders entry in my message list (about 20seconds on my Moto G running CyanogenMod). If I try to open the conversation with said sender, it takes even longer and (more than two minutes). Often it just crashes while trying to preview. Once I managed to actually see the message. It looked like lots of encrypted data that TextSecure did not decode but showed it as text. I could not copy the message, as TextSecure crashed some seconds later (see log [1]) Sometimes TextSecure even crashes when trying to preview the senders message in the general (see log [2]). When save my messages via plaintext export, the problematic message does not show up. Thus I don't know how to pass it to you. Do you have any advice? By the way, as TextSecure crashes when showing the message, I have no idea how to delete the message to make TextSecure work again. Do you have any ideas? My device data: Motorola Moto G Cyanogenmod 11-20140504-SNAPSHOT-M6-falcon Android 4.4.2 If you need any other information, I will be happy to provide it.

		Love textsecure, been using it for years. Got a little feature request. I'm a sysadmin, about to be in the company's on-call rotation. We get nagios alerts sent to our phones via emailing the carrier's email-to-text service. Is it possible to export my public key for textsecure so I can use it to run a script on our nagios servers which calls gpg, uses my public key to encrypt the message contents, and then sends the encrypted message via my carrier's email-to-text service, and have it automatically decrypted in textsecure, even though there's been no key exchange via textsecure's api? Is this already possible and I just don't know how? Thanks guys, really love this program, and really looking forward to the ios port (my gf's on an iphone, and we're loving Signal, can't wait for encrypted messaging, too).

		When I get a message containing only (or almost only) a phone number and I want to delete it this is quite difficult. When I long press the message, Textsecure both shows the upper toolbar with the delete button and I get a complete action dialog box from Android offering several ways to call the number (phone, skype, strangely not Redphone which I have also installed). When I press back to remove this dialog and then press the delete button it does nothing (well, at leat it does not delete the selected message). It doesn't show any message or error.

		A friend of mine could never get TS secure to work on their Huawai Android 4.3 system. I had exchanged some messages with them. After they uninstalled TS on their phone, my TS kept thinking they were using TS and kept sending all messages as encrypted. I.e. they always got garbled text instead of the message. I had to select 'End Secure Session' to stop this. The latter should happen automatic somehow.

		Some iota of intelligence or integration in Textsecure with systems running whisper-push (CyanogenMod) would be amazing. My interpretation of this stance here is by lack of integration and support directly from whispersystems is that whispersystems would prefer its users use textsecure app and NOT whisperpush... However this isn't explicitly stated, but seems to be implied

		Hi, TextSecure should detect if WhisperPush is enabled in the system (did not check how - I guess you can somehow read arbitrary system settings with the right permissions) and then warn the user to switch it off (and instead enable push messages in TS). Here's why: It's actually possible to install TS on a system with WhisperPush as long as you don't turn on push messages. Obviously that makes little sense, but users might still do it, and it leads to a mess, as stated in #1925 .

		TS is awesome, but one feature missing fromthe stock messenger app is the ability to lock a message withing a thread. As you know, in the stock messenger (well on CM11) I can lock messages from friends with pics, dates to remmeber, etc. and if I try to delete the entire thread. Those messages are not deleted and remain after everything else in the thread is. TS should support this to be a total messager replacement.

		I am aware of the decision to fade out SMS/MMS support for security reasons. Unfortunately, I still need to (unsafely) communicate with people with &quot;feature phones&quot;.

		In Korea, most of carriers are providing anti-SMS phishing service by default. This service puts &quot;[Web발신]\n&quot; prefix to SMS body when they are sent through automated sending service. As a result, TextSecure app cannot recognize received verification code due to it only matches message begins with &quot;Your TextSecure verification code: &quot; (https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/service/SmsListener.java#L129). I think this matching filter should include wildcard in front of word &quot;Your&quot; or Throw away everything except last line and filter with them. Here is screenshot of message which I received.

		Hello, I read on your blog post (https://whispersystems.org/blog/private-groups/) about some optimizations that could be done to group chats. Unfortunately I happen to spend a lot of time in places where the internet connection isn't so good, and this is often a problem. For example: I send a message to the 5 other members of the group; While the application is sending the message to the 3rd recipient, the 1st already has the message and answers back; Since the internet connection of the 1st is better than mine, the 4th and 5th recipients often get the 1st's message before mine -- that is, they see the message with the answer before the message with the question. Is anything being done to improve the speed of messages sent in group chats? It's not only slightly annoying, it's also causing many problems because it's not so easy to understand &quot;who is answering which message&quot; when messages come in the wrong order. Thank you

		Hi, I have the stock Android 4.4 on a Motorola Moto G and my friend has Cyanogen Mod with TS as standard SMS app. We used it before on another phone, so now he has a different key. Mine however stayed the same. I can't tell my TS to switch his key. He also doesn't receive my messages (they're probably encrypted with the wrong key? Our numbers stayed the same). I do receive his though. I also receive messages with a key symbol and TS tells me that this might mean that someone's trying to intercept messages (I don't remember the exact message). Anyway, so I tried to end the secure session and it said session cancelled but I guess it didn't really cancel it because the &quot;cancel secure session&quot; didn't disappear. My friend send me his new key via QR-code by email and when I wanted to verify it, I got the message, that this is not the same key. Well, I knew that ...;) Is there a way to delete his key on my phone and start a new encrypted converation? Does it have something to do with me using the App from Google Play and him using the integrated CM app? Why can't I cancel the secure session? Shouldn't that always be possible? thanks!

		Hey, I just reached for my blinking mobile (Nexus One, MIUI 2.3.23, Android 2.3.7) to read a TextSecure message. TS has been restarted (it asked for my passphrase) and after entering that, I see TS has lost all my messages but the newly received one (which is from a group now called Unnamed group). Unlike last time, I did not restart my phone, and instead tried to get some logging data out. I have no USB cable with me unfortunately. On a terminal (on device) as root I tried logcat | grep -E &quot;TextSecure|whispersystems&quot;, but all I got was W/PartProvider( 2725): Got master secret: org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.MasterSecret@406b92a0 (... or so... beware, I typewrote that) So I guess the ringbuffer is already emptied, meh. Do you know of any way of getting my messages and pictures back? Can I supply you with more information so we can get to the cause of this? Losing the TS database happened to me once before; Last time, I put the blame on the failing battery and subsequent file system recovery. This time, it just happened like that. Of course I tell all my friends to keep backups, of course I have none. So maybe it's just Karma. Meh.

		First of all, the technical details: Nexus S (Crespo) with CyanogenMod 11-20140916-SNAPSHOT-M10-crespo, Android 4.4.4 Now the problem: It seems, that TextSecure doesn't notify me about new received Messages when i lock the Phone while keeping the Conversation open, even if the Option &quot;In-thread notifications&quot; is checked. No Vibration, no Sound and no Icon in the status Bar.

		I have disables the push delivery because it does not allways deliver messages and is very slow compared to encrypted sms messages. Currently it is not possible to permanently remove the big green &quot;Enable TextSecure messages? ...&quot; which takes up 25% of the screen.

		Currently TextSecure requires the verification SMS to be exactly Your TextSecure verification code: NNN[N]-NNN[N]. But some mobile carriers apparently append or prepend a certain text to the original SMS. The relevant portion of the verification code should accept them as well. In my particular case, Korean carriers have prepended [Sent from Web] to every SMS sent from non-mobile devices as a (poor) countermeasure to SMS spams, and TextSecure simply misses them. While this (dis)service is optional, it is opt-out and many Korean users are likely affected.

		When using TextSecure as SMS replacement app, there occurs an issue if one contact tries out TextSecure but then decides to go back to some other IM. Then TextSecure always pre-selects sending a secure push message - which will never arrive because the contact no longer uses TextSecure. So either one should be able to set the default communication channel for TextSecure contacts back to unsecure SMS, or at least TextSecure should remember the last communication channel per contact and default to that for the next message.

		nexus 5 android 4.4.4 push TS 2.1.8 sometimes when i receive photos as attachments they don't download, they thumbnail stays in download mode forever, force quitting and starting again doesn't help. i'm suspecting it can be caused by a handover from data-wifi or vice versa, where the internet connection drops for a bit. i frequently (dis-)connect to wifi networks. my contacts complain about the same problem, i have to re-send photos that show the completed status on my side. so the sender has no indication that the delivery failed. log might be too new :( http://hastebin.com/loduruqiga

		Hello, I have a problem. My internet provider slows my phone's connection after I reach 1GB of data. It slows it so I can't go faster than 30KB/s, but that's better than nothing. The problem is that although I am able to use other messaging applications (internet is slow, but still works), TextSecure doesn't send messages. At all. I do receive them, but I can't send them. They never go from the dull blue to the bright blue. And what's even worse is that even if after I connect the phone to a WiFi, it won't send those messages. Any ideas? I know I could send SMSs, but I'm looking for a solution and not a workaround. Thank you

		Dear TextSecure develop team, I am a honest user and a developer based on your source code. There are some problems while I am using the TextSecure app recently.

1.  We can send the push message and sms message if we change another simcard which is not the same as the register number. But there will be some problems if we send a secure sms message, cause the simcard number is not the same as the register number, besides that, it will leads to anther secret key exchange, if we exchange it again the new received message or secure sms message seems crupt and can not be decrypt in our app.
Reproduce steps:
1) register with number 180.....
2) remove the simcard and insert anther simcard
3) send a secure message to a friend in our contacts
4) send a sms messgae to the same number above
5) send a secure message to the same number above
you can find some problems here...

2. Can not choose which simcard to send the sms message with a dural sim cards support phone, so my question is can we support the dual simcards phone both can send secure message?

I am waiting for your help, thanks!

		I'd love the ability to use Signal/TextSecure as my primary messaging app, but the lack of multi-device syncing is holding me back. At the same time, I know that most services that offer multi-device syncing (Hangouts, iMessage, etc) do so by storing your keys in the cloud, making your communications snoopable. So, I think it would be cool if I could get multi-device syncing from WhisperSystems apps, through directly transferring my secret key from one device to another, for example through NFC or WiFi direct. This might call for decoupling WhisperSystems IDs from PSTN phone numbers.

I tried to close the encrypted chat and things but nothing works. now we can't chat anymore. The same problem happened to another friend some months ago. He got frustrated and deleted TextSecure, so the problem got fixed for him too, in a bad way... using WhatsApp ;)

		Hello, sometimes it happens to me that TS doesn't send messages. The bubble of the message never turns &quot;dark blue&quot;, you know? I am correctly connected to the internet and all the other apps work fine. What's worse is that the stuck message seems to prevent future messages from being sent, too. I have to reboot (just deleting the message not being sent doesn't work), and it's very annoying as many times I don't even realize until hours later -- because I rely on the &quot;background sending&quot;... bad idea. Unfortunately I don't have a debug log (I will post one when it happens again), but I was wondering if this is a known bug...? Thank you

		Hello, I have to report a weird bug. The other day I sent a message to a group chat. &quot;N&quot; receives the message just fine, and answers back. &quot;A&quot; responds to me in a private conversation (all this is happening via push), probably saying they couldn't read my message (?), but their message appears as &quot;bad encrypted message&quot;. Annoyed by this problem that has always plagued me since the very day I installed TextSecure (it keeps happening every once in a while), I end the secure session with A, unregister from the push service and register again. Now A can read my messages and I can read theirs. Yesterday I posted another message to the same group. A could read it and respond, while N couldn't. However, when N writes me in a private chat between us alone, everything works fine (we read each other's messages). This &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; has been affecting me -- and my friends -- ever since we installed the application. Is there a reason why it happens? Please find a fix, I feel embarrassed for recommending my friends this application and causing them all these troubles.

		This is something that I miss very much in this app. I know this isn't needed for a push message, but for an SMS it is. Current implementation of displaying number only if 15 chars are left (first image) is not very convenient, because I don't know if I'm on a first set of 120 chars or did I write more than 120 chars. Images 2 and 3 are just a sketch: what if there would be option to display this indicator permanently. https://mediacru.sh/d71d311f7466 Or something combined: number of characters left will be displayed when 15 chars are left to second message, and if you cross to second/third/... message a permanent message number indicator would be displayed.

		I've seen this mentioned a few times about 8 months back, and I'm just wondering: what's the current solution to this problem? Let's say the user is unwilling to re-install TS to de-register their account from the network. What's the plan at that point? I've had this happen with a few friends, even just when they've had to temporarily use loner phones, and it's fairly frustrating. I spend a bit of time each day reading on privacy and security. They're very important to me, and for someone like me/us, having to mess around with this stuff is no big deal. But for the average person? Believe me, bits of friction like this are more than enough to turn them off completely, making widespread adoption all but impossible. If you need any additional information, don't hesitate to ask.

		After about a week of successful encrypted communications with a particular contact, I started receiving garbled messages. We both ended the secure session, deleted the conversation, and restarted it, at which point I got a &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; error. After ending this second (and apparently unsuccessful) secure session, we are communicating unencrypted and I am using plain sms (not push) messages. When I send a message to said contact, I am (after a delay) receiving my own message echoed back as if the contact had sent it to me -- complete with a notification alert. This has happened twice now. The first time my own message was echoed back 6 minutes after I sent it. The second time, 25 minutes afterward. Here's my debug log: http://hastebin.com/nuhewuwunu

		When my friends send me a vertical taken picture Textsecure seems to rotate and save it horizonal. Its very anoying. Could there be an option tu rotate pictures inside textsecure and watch them in fullscreen in the encryptet format? So with out the needing to save them outside textsecure. In the the little what i know of programming I¨d imagine its an easy fix to make rotating option?

		I have registered and unregistered a user with my local TS server. TS now shows this user as a registered PUSH user although this user is definetly no in the PSQL database on my server. Deleting this user from my contacts and adding him again, TS shows this user as unregistered for the first time but then as registered in the second run. When trying to send a message to him the first PUSH mesage gets lots but then TS is trying to send a encr. SMS to him. Any thoughts why this happens? http://hastebin.com/ofupufoxib

		Over the weekend I added a member to a Textsecure group I've been using successfully for months. The delivery receipts had been working great until I added this new member. Now when I send a message to the group, I see the background go from dark blue to medium blue, then the delivery receipt checkbox shows up and then disappears! Certainly not a show-stopper but I was loving this functionality. Notes: I had the two contacts under the same contact using sub-numbers initially when this started happening. Since then I split them out into two separate contacts but the problem is not resolved. SGS4, Verizon, stock 4.4.2

		I'm running Android 4.4 on a Nexus 4. During installation, I received a verification SMS, which resulted in a notification in my notification center. After having set TextSecure as my default SMS app, I was no longer able to dismiss the notification. I was able to work around this by temporarily setting the built-in app as the default, dismissing the message, and then setting TextSecure as the default again. Not a huge deal, but a minor usability annoyance. Really awesome app, thanks for making it!

Instead they are shown as coming from a unique 3 difit number that seems to start with a 9 each time. We have attempted to add the from email address ass a contact. We do know that this does not happen with all android textsecure installations. Any help moving us closer to getting all of the messages clustered under the same contact would be helpful.

		Hello ! I installed textsecured on two phones. On the second one, the icon to send the message is blue, and the lock is closed, so I assume this means I can send secured sms to the first phone. But on the first phone, the icon is still green, and the lock still open. So I can just send classic SMS to the second phone. When I disable the ability to send classic SMS on this phone, I am unable to send SMS to the second one. Is there a way to force the use of secured sms, or is it a bug ? Thank you for your answer, and please excuse my flawed english.

		I have an issue that is similar to #2067 - I did not add someone to the group chat, but for one member, delivery notifications seem to error out (see #2086). As soon as this receipt is received, the message goes into &quot;error state&quot;, i.e. displaying the error-triangle. This feels kinda wrong, because it looks like the message was not sent at all. Then, as soon as another receipt is received (from someone else in the group), the message goes back to &quot;everything OK&quot; - now it's not visible anymore that there was any problem.

		SMS supports sending longer messages in multiple chunks (I am actually not sure how this works on the protocol level). TextSecure should be able to assemble them.

			<description>
		From an article on Android Police: &quot;Google's final announcement [about Google Play Services 6.5] may actually have the greatest impact of all. With the latest release, the GMS library will be broken up into individual parts for each major set of APIs. This will finally alleviate the stress of including the full library, which weighs in at almost exactly 1 MB after it's compiled into an app. For example, an app that only requires push messaging will be able to do so while only increasing its footprint by about 75KB. While most users with current, high-end devices probably don't notice the burden, this is great for older and budget-oriented hardware. This change will also go a long way towards reducing memory usage and download size. Oh yeah, and this should cut a minute or two off of compile times. Hallelujah!&quot;

To verify my assumption I added DynamicTheme to PassphraseChangeActivity which seemed to helped. (I am aware that this activity is not fully themed yet. In fact I'm working on applying dynamic themeing were it's missing...) EDIT coming back from submit debug also recolors the icons and yes, latest HEAD :)

		Nexus 5, Android 5.0 (LRX21O), TextSecure 2.3.0, default keyboard settings Performance is fine when the device first boots but degrades quickly and input becomes noticeably delayed. RAM usage climbs as well, currently it's at 272MB with 16.5 hours of uptime. This only affects the keyboard in landscape mode. I only have a few dozen threads with no more than a handful of messages in each. This problem is also experienced by a friend who has a Nexus 5.

		I compiled according to the Wiki. According to the wiki, the compile dependencies are: &quot;Android SDK manager&quot;
&quot;Android Support Repository&quot; - this need to be installed via the Android SDK manager
&quot;Java Development Kit (JDK)&quot; compiler for example openjdk-devel - JRE alone is not enough. At least version 7 of Java is required.
 Despite having the dependencies, compiling didn't work, it complained about a missing com.google.android.gms:play-services. I had to install the following additional packages: &quot;Google Play Services, Google Repository, Google Play services for Froyo&quot;. I don't know if all of these were needed, but I am sure Google Repository was needed. This made the compiler go a lot further. (It still fails but it's probably be an unrelated issue) After doing this, the compilation went a bit further, but now there's a new error:

		Hi there. I am using Android 4.0.4 on the Sony Xperia Mini. Textsecure worked just fine but since recently (last update?) it closes immediately after starting it. Funny: In the background of the force close message I can see the Textsecure surface coming up - so in fact it starts but I cannot use it. logcat shows this: W/GooglePlayServicesUtil( 4256): Google Play services out of date.

		I would like to update the &quot;Prerequisites&quot; section of the Wiki, because the list is incomplete and compiling fails unless several additional packages which are not mentioned in the wiki are installed via the Android Package Manager. However, I believe I installed unnecessary packages in addition to the needed ones. Before applying the changes to the Wiki, I would like to reduce the packages to the minimum needed set. Please help me by trimming unneeded fat from the following list: Prerequisites &quot;Android SDK manager&quot; &quot;Java Development Kit (JDK)&quot; compiler for example openjdk-devel - JRE alone is not enough. At least version 7 of Java is required. The following packages should be installed via the package manager: Android Support Repository, Android Support Library, Android SDK build-tools 19, Google Play Services, Android 4.4.2 (API 19) SDK Platform, Android 5.0 (API 21) SDK Platform, Android 4.4W.2 (API 20) SDK Platform, Google Repository.

		Since the update to version 2.30 of TextSecure I'm no longer able to start it. I'm using a Xperia Arc S with Android Version 4.04 (API-Level 15). Here the StackTrace: java.lang.RuntimeException: Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare() at android.os.Handler.(Handler.java: 121) at android.widget.Toast$TN. (Toast:317) at android.widget.Toast.(Toast.java:91) at android.widget.Toast.makeText(Toast.java:233) at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.GcmRefreshJob.onRun(GcmRefreshJob.java:41) at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.runJob(JobConsumer.java:72) at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.run(JobConsumer.java:46) I typed in the StackTrace by hand, therefore there may be typos. But I think the problem gets clear. I tried to trace back the exception in the source code, and it seemed that the JobConsumer should call Looper.prepare, but didn't do so. On the otherhandside I also wasn't able to find a call to makeText in the GcmRefreshJob and I doesn't look like everybody got this problem. I hope this can be fixed soon. Edit: As I just found out GcmRefreshJob changed in commit bf19307 from 13 hours ago. Maybe this already fixes the problem.

		Seriously, just like my previous ticket: WhisperSystems#1866 Suddenly, without any notice, TS 2.3.0 requires a newer &quot;Google Play Services&quot; to be installed. Unlike other apps, who warn you of this problem, TS just crashes on start if you have the wrong version. Why is it so hard to: Write it in the changelog Check for the version on app-startup and display some sort of dialog (like google maps, e.g.) Provide support for older versions

		When upgrading from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0 TextSecure crashed and I had to downfgade. Installing 2.2.0 over 2.3.0 refused (is this a bug somewhere or done deliberately?) so I had to deinstall 2.3.0, install 2.2.0 and restore my Titanium backup. 2.3.2 did work, but complained that push mesages didn't work anymore because my Google Play Services were too old. I upgraded these to the last version, but it would have been nice if the message gave more information, like the mimimum version required.

		For about the last two days, I've been getting the notification &quot;Permanent TextSecure communication failure!&quot; with the text &quot;TextSecure was unable to register with Google Play Services. Com&quot;. After &quot;Com&quot; I'm was sure there were more letters but they are cut off. I don't know how newer Android versions work, but on 2.3.7 the notifications don't scroll so only by reading through code can I find the text that says &quot;Communication over the data channel has been disabled, please try re-registering from the TextSecure settings menu.&quot; Of course, the next problem I have is that I cannot find any &quot;re-register&quot; option in the settings menu. Again, reading code shows me that the RegistrationActivity intent is launched by enabling &quot;Push messages&quot;, which is already enabled. So, I do that. And now, finally, I get a warning message. Google Play Services needs to be updated to use this. So there's the issue. I'm actually guessing that I didn't need to re-register, I probably just needed to update Google Play Services. Can't say for sure though, as I've already de-registered. Anyway, the original notification is thrown up by a failed call to GooglePlayServicesUtil.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(context). Instead of just checking for &quot;resullt != ConnectionResult.SUCCESS&quot;, TS could also check for the other possible return values and tell the user the actual reason behind the error.

		Hello! My problem is, if i send a message via Push it works great but if I have no Internet connection the message didn't get sent. In earlier version it worked. I don't use Xprivacy and TS has all rights. Now I solve it, that a hold the send button and switch to send via secure SMS, but I would prefer, when this happens automatically when I have no Internet connection.

		I recently upgraded to version 2.3.2 from 2.1.10. After doing so, I can no longer send SMS messages over T-mobile's WiFi Calling, although I can receive them just fine. I can send PUSH messages over WiFi Calling, and if I disable WiFi calling I can send SMS over the cellular network. If I used the built-in Messaging app, I can send SMS over WiFi Calling with no problem. This seems similar to #2137 so I disabled XPrivacy, but that doesn't fix anything. I'm creating a new issue because I'm not having problems with PUSH messages or with receiving SMS.

So I clicked on &quot;resend&quot; aaaaand.... it sent the photo as an MMS instead of a push message. What's funny is that in the settings I allowed outgoing SMSs ONLY to non-textsecure users, so that's another reason why this shouldn't have happened. In Europe, we do pay for an MMS and they're usually pretty expensive. After all the &quot;MMS fixes&quot; I wonder how come no one ever fixed this.. ?

		After setting up a couple of people with TextSecure, we were all stumped that TextSecure did not have a way to add a new phone number to a Contact. We tried everything we can think of and no luck. So I decided to file a bug report, and found #822 then explored a bit more, and found that you can add an unknown number as a contact by clicking the blank avatar icon. This was not intuitive but I think it can be greatly improved by a simple fix: add a + to the blank avatar icon if clicking it will trigger the &quot;add to contacts&quot; sequence.

		Not sure if this is a regression of the latest release, but I just noticed this behaviour on my Samsung SIII (GT-I9300) and wife's GT-I9305, both with stock Android 4.3 - both with latest TextSecure. When looking at a contact's thread, long pressing on messages that include: a photo or a number that has been auto-recognized by Android (therefore underlined) ... does not work as expected: Such messages cannot be selected (they will not be highlighted), even though the &quot;info&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; buttons will show up. Performing any action on them (like copy or forward) makes it obvious (when pasting or sending the forwarded message) that a different message has actually been copied to the clipboard! Example: I long-press on msg number 10 in a thread, click the &quot;copy&quot; icon, then paste in the text input area and a different message (usually 11 or 14 ) is pasted! The same effect is seen with copy/paste, forward and message deletion. To test whether you're affected by this bug: Find a TextSecure message that meets the above criteria (has underlined numbers or a photo) Long-press to select it Tap the &quot;copy&quot; icon Long-press in the message composition area Tap &quot;paste&quot; If a different message (or nothing) is pasted, you're bitten by the bug.

		When reinstalling TextSecure or switching the SIM card to another phone, PUSH service registration often fails because the number is already registered. This forces the user to go to https://whispersystems.org/textsecure/unregister/ and unregister manually. Average users don't know that they have to unregister first. They even don't know the above mentioned page. And that GCM eventually notifies the server about unregistration seems unreliable due to the fact that many users really have trouble with this issue and are unable to proceed using TextSecure. (just wondering if similar steps are necessary when web sockets come in...) I propose to let the registration process check if the number is already registered and automatically perform the necessary steps to unregister and re-register the number. When I understand the unregister web page correctly, this is authenticated by receiving an SMS (or call). I think this is possible when using the same SIM card / phone number. This would greatly enhance the usability.

		I have searched through all issues and was wondering i couldn't find this issue neither open nor closed. The idea is to have a status message with text and/or emojis for yourself and group chats. The problem for this ER is to display the message, because at the moment there's no space for it. If we look at e.g.: Whatsapp, you can see the status in the chat overview and in a contacts view Currently you can see the last message in the chat overview. I would rather like to see the status message of a user there instead. So I think it would be a smaller problem to achieve this. To have a status message in the contacts view is a tougher job, because there is no contacts view yet. What we have now is the stock android contacts view you get, after clicking on the contacts avatar in the overview. So this would be an entirely new view. Maybe this should be a new issue also... An own contacts view would be a nice improvement, because we could add other little informations there. I think this little nice improvement would make it more fun to use TS.

		Since Nov 25 (so shorty after the 2.3 release) some push notifications are not delivered.

		A friend has TextSecure but deactivates the data connection oftentimes during the day. Since I can’t tell when it’s active or not on their side (and I’m too lazy / I forget), I always send via data. This results in the messages not being delivered until said friend activates the data connection again (even though they have normal cell connection, so a text would go through). I’m pretty sure this is a known problem but I couldn’t find an existing issue for it. Also not sure if it’s possible to solve or an underlying architectural problem. I was thinking something like: If the push message isn’t delivered in 10 minutes, automatically re-send it via text and delete the push message from the queue. If that’s possible.

			<description>
		While it's nice to have receipts that a message has been received (i.e. by the receiving TextSecure app), in some cases it would be even better to have to know if a message has been viewed. By default, this might be too much information to provide, but it would be nice if a user could specify that s/he wants to make this information available to a set of other users.

On a thread of 8 mixed devices (iOS, textsecure, various android) If I click the message from the notification dropdown, the message does not load and I need to re-enter my password to get in. Clicking the check mark to &quot;mark as read&quot; seems to work fine. This started happening recently, but it's been probably at least a week since my most recent other group message. I have not tried doing anything with picture messages. Group messages with 3 other TS users are fine.

		I live in an out of service area and so I use Tmobile's wifi calling feature a lot. TextSecure has worked wonderfully for a long time (a couple years) but just very recently, I cannot send text messages while connected via the wifi calling. I can receive text messages using wifi calling, but then I have to switch to the regular texting app that came with my phone to send anything. If I'm connected to cell service directly, I can both send and receive without issue. My phone is an HTC Amaze, not rooted, running android 4.0.3. The debug log from textSecure's settings menu shows just this: Device: HTC HTC_Amaze_4G (htc_ruby) Android: IML74K OS Host: abm022 App :TextSecure 2.3.3 (the &quot;app&quot; line is formatted on my phone with two spaces before the colon and none after)

		TextSecure kept crashing when I would open text message threads. So I'm trying backup all my data to my laptop and delete all threads from my phone to start fresh. But I'm not sure how to view the images or messages in the &quot;plaintext backup&quot; on my phone. How do you do this? It is a mixture of mms, sms, and push messages.

		Hello, I am unable to attach photos and other files from my external SD card to messages. When I select “Add attachment” in a message thread, the file browser only shows the entries “Recent”, “Downloads”, and “Internal Storage”, lacking the SD card (as well as, say, the Gallery app, but that’s of no importance to me) regardless of whether I want to send a picture, video, or sound (see picture). The SD card is a 64 GB, Samsung-made card of the “EVO” series. Sending files from my old, 8 GB SD card worked and works just fine. However, all the other apps I’ve tried accessing the new card with (Gallery, Total Commander, PPSSPP, …) see, read from, and write to it without a problem. It might be an issue with the file picker, but I couldn’t find another app that uses the same one as TextSecure. My device is a European Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I’m running Android 4.4.2 which I have rooted, but I’ve found nothing pertaining to this in XPrivacy’s settings.

		AFAICS, textsecure uses some Kex based on DH which is effectively anonymous. When I add a new contact, it immediately sells me the conversation as being secure, even when no fingerprint exchange or something like that has happened. This basically makes the whole app and idea of encryption useless as anyone could MitM and I wouldn't notice, which is made even worse by the fact that I cannot even mark such contacts which I've manually verified to be verified (as it's e.g. known from OTR). Actually I'd prefer an option that I can reject any contacts which I haven't verified.

		A contact of mine sent me a vcard that contained an image via MMS. Textsecure downloaded it and displayed the whole ASCII encoded image as text which slowed down the app to the point where it crashed. Textsecure was not usable until i managed to delete the MMS (on the 5th try it did not crash). This could be used as some kind of DOS attack i think. Please include some kind of safeguard.

		Version 2.3.3 Motorola Moto X2, android 4.4.4 on Republic Wireless. If you're not familiar, RW uses a baked-in VOIP app to allow normally cell-based functions like calls and SMS to go over wifi. While on wifi only, Textsecure will receive SMS normally. It will not send SMS, secure or plain. It does however send secure Push Messages to other Textsecure users with no issue. Stock Messenger app will send both SMS and MMS over wifi no problem.

			<description>
		According to @liliakai (we spoke in the Freenode channel), TextSecure uses SMS delivery reports rather than issuing them itself. This allows a malicious service provider (or, depending on exactly how secure SMS is, anyone that happens to be nearby the recipient) to withhold|drop a message that was sent via SMS while issuing a successful delivery report, potentially resulting in heated debates over messages that never actually arrived. To prevent this, TextSecure should issue its own (signed) delivery reports.

		We are using a group chat with 9 members (A, B, C ... H, I). I'm running TextSecure 2.3.3. The following happens when I try to send a message inside our group: I do see the small tick underneath the message (no blue or green background) I receive a warning that there was an error while sending the message (green background, red triangle), the tick disappears I receive a message telling me that there are changed, but unknown identity information. I can tap on the message, the message is replaced with a key. Nevertheless, everyone in the group receives my message. The same problem exists for at least two more users (B and C), but interesteringly not for everyone. Another problem is that I don't receive any messages from user D, but everyone else does (including B and C). There are also some users who don't have any problems at all. There are no problems if I send a direct message to any of our group members. The messages are encrypted and sent (blue background), everything seems to be fine.

		Occurs with latest HEAD. I suspect #2237 causes this, as it worked before. Could be coincidence. Self sending media message leads to receiving message bubble misses image the avater is default mr. open mouth (though contact has an own avatar) receive bubble only appears on reentering conversation or sending another message sometimes the bubble is green instead of blue after sending (blue after reentering) Text only works though - avatar is correct. Also receiving non self messages seems to work. 12-23 10:21:26.172  13028-13054/org.thoughtcrime.securesms W/MmsSmsDatabase﹕ Executing query: SELECT _id, body, type, thread_id, address, address_device_id, subject, date_sent, date_received, m_type, msg_box, status, part_count, ct_l, tr_id, m_size, exp, st, delivery_receipt_count, transport_type FROM (SELECT DISTINCT date_sent * 1 AS date_sent, date * 1 AS date_received, _id, body, read, thread_id, type, address, address_device_id, subject, NULL AS m_type, NULL AS msg_box, status, NULL AS part_count, NULL AS ct_l, NULL AS tr_id, NULL AS m_size, NULL AS exp, NULL AS st, delivery_receipt_count, 'sms' AS transport_type FROM sms WHERE (thread_id = 11) UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT date * 1000 AS date_sent, date_received * 1000 AS date_received, _id, body, read, thread_id, NULL AS type, address, address_device_id, NULL AS subject, m_type, msg_box, NULL AS status, part_count, ct_l, tr_id, m_size, exp, st, delivery_receipt_count, 'mms' AS transport_type FROM mms WHERE (thread_id = 11) ORDER BY date_received ASC)

		Using Android 4.4.4, Textsecure 2.3.3, on Motorola XT1032. Textsecure was installed from Google Play Store. When I configure Textsecure as standard SMS app and deactivate the internet connections, Textsecure should send messages as SMS also to Textsecure contacts. This does not work for one phone number of my address book (it says error sending message, both for encrypted and unencrypted SMS). The phone number contained a plus sign (+49). When I replaced it by 0049, it worked, so I think the cause for the error message is the + sign. The phone number is also valid with the plus sign, so Textsecure should be able to cope with it.

		Hello all, Recently, I've switched to Viperone m8 3.2.1 rom on my HTC one m8 (Verizon). Everything seems to work fine including calls, 4g/3g, etc. However, it doesn't detect my sim card properly as it should. So this causes TextSecure to ask for my MMS settings even though it already had them entered. The strange part is that I can send MMS txts just fine. But not receive them. See the pictures below. I even tried to add my APN, but there is no option to add it. Debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aba2acd498cfc7b53ec4

		Several times now, I've sent a friend a message only to have them tell me out-of-band that they received it, but couldn't read it. All of these occasions happened when we didn't communicate for several days. I'm guessing that the undecryptable behaviour is intentional, due to Axolotl deleting unused message keys after a timeout, to prevent an attack where the adversary withholds ciphertext in the hope of recovering the recipient device later. If my diagnosis is correct, please add some sort of UI indication on the sending side that this may be taking place. Currently, the absence of &quot;delivery failed&quot; suggests to me they received it and decrypted it, when only the former is true and the latter is false.

		Hi, the scenario: B sends an image to A over encrypted channel. There is an error on transmission A cannot decrypt the message Textsecure interprets the message as plaintext (in the pane with all chats it is visible in preview as some base64-string) On opening of the chat Textsecure tries to render the multi-kilobyte &quot;text&quot; message Crash This is critical as A can not chat with B any more. The only hotfix so far seems that B sends 10-20 messages to A, so the corrupted message is not visible on opening the conversation, but only after scrolling. It is still impossible to scroll behind the corrupted message this way, so this is just a temporary hotfix. Suggested fix: all text messages with more than X characters are rendered only partially and have to be clicked on to be shown completely. This will allow for the corruped message to be rendered partially and removed by hand. (As a side effect this will allow for easier scrolling beyond long messages)

		I know this is a huge feature request and my intention is to begin the discussion. I've just started using TextSecure as a secure replacement for Google Hangouts. I use Hangouts both on my Android phone and on the desktop, so that I can switch to a full size keyboard when I am at home or work. This is a great feature that I'd love to see implemented by a secure messaging system. My suspicion is that multiple clients acting as the same identity (and hence all being able to read the same chat history and send messages) is either impossible or very difficult to achieve in a client-side encryption model. Is this true? Do you have any intention to support such a feature in the short or long term?

		Cyanogmod WhisperPush is currently holding my account hostage. It will not allow me to unregister and therefore I am not able to register with TextSecure. I also am not able to use WhisperPush as the phone I registered with was wiped and sold. WhisperPush's registration seems to be broken server-side and they don't seem to be responsive. While I agree that this is Cyanogemod's issue, I do see this as a design flaw of TextSecure as you could create a DOS for users. There seem to be a fair amount of people having this issue. See the following: daveio/whisperpush-unregister#11 https://jira.cyanogenmod.org/browse/CYAN-4512 http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/8112872-how-to-register-after-exhausting-all-options-for-unregistering-from-whisperpush I apologize if this is a proper issue, I just wanted to start some discussion around it.

		Currently message delivery is unreliable. It often happens that I send a message to someone, but do not get a message receipt (check-mark icon). Messages sent later get a receipt. When I talk to the person a few hours later, they tell me they did not receive the message. This issue is not limited to me sending, but also happens the other way around. It also happens for other people, as I have been told. It also happens for the message receipts themselves – sometimes a message arrives on my phone, but the sender never receives the receipt. The CyanogenMod integrated WhisperPush service is not involved. The issue happens between stock Android users, as well as with CyanogenMod users. From reading other issues I understand that GCM does not offer reliable delivery. I wonder if the equivalent of XEP-0198 section 4 &quot;Acks&quot; could be implemented on top of it in TextSecure.

		In my opinion it would be a great enhancement to see if the other person is typing at the moment. If I write long texts for example and click on send but keep writing to send another message I often get interrupted because the other person doesn't know that some more messages will follow... Would there be any chance to add something like &quot;xy's typing&quot; (WhatsApp) or some &quot;...&quot; (Hangouts)? Or do you think there's no need for it?

		Hi Folks, I seem unable to send an MMS using TextSecure. This is on T-Mobile in the US with an HTC One M2. All I get is an error that says, &quot;Error sending message&quot;. I'm not so expert at reading debug logs, but this looks like it might be the root of the problem: Connection to http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com:80 refused W/OutgoingMmsConnection( 6786): at ... A few other notes: I get the same error whether I send a &quot;secure MMS&quot; or an &quot;insecure MMS&quot;. I can send via secure TextSecure message: no error, and the message goes through, SMS works. (But I can't send a picture, of course.) I have tried both with the automatic settings, and by manually setting the MMSC URL setting to the one found here (http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapenc). Neither seems to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

		this is with Textsecure 2.3.3 on Cyanogenmod 10 on a Sony Xperia Mini Pro: Sending pictures via PUSH does not work reliably for me. Failing is not 100% reproducable but these steps seem to trigger the failure regularly: attach a picture from inside the app via &quot;add attachment&quot; * attach a picture via &quot;share&quot; from another app and also add a text to the same message Failure means either: the message does not get send, and I get a read triangle, the message turns green and a tab appears with &quot;tap for MMS fallback&quot; ** or the message gets send but the receiver gets a MMS which gets rendered as a HUGE chunk of text (the processing of which makes the receivers Textsecure process appear as frozen) *** What seems to work (but I could swear that I saw this fail also some time ago) is attaching a picture via &quot;share&quot; from another app and NOT add any text in the same message... *) I captured a logcat for this scenario **) I was not even aware of a MMS fallback feature, as I have no configuration option for this (in contrast to the SMS fallback). Is there one? ***) I guess I have to pay for all these MMSs? :-( [edited] cleared up formatting for the footnotes

I get a brief glimpse of my inbox and then the crash occurs. This behavior continues after rebooting the device.

		Hello, If both contacts have configured push delivery, all messages will be sent with it by default. It's good as it means free messages but some people still wants to send SMS (as not sure the contact will be connected, cf #2222). I know you can long press the send button to change the delivery for the current message but it's the default delivery method that I would like to change (I have a friend who refused to switch to TextSecure because still wanted to send SMS by default). Another way to solve it, add a discrete option next to the send button, a bit like what's done in Facebook Messenger with location. I can try to make a pull request if that's a feature you would accept (may take a bit of time though).

At around this time, TextSecure began to crash after being open for between 10 and 40 seconds, regardless current screen or message threads having been opened. This makes it very difficult to troubleshoot as the app dies quickly after opening. I also experience previously sent vcards being posted again as if they were new messages after each crash.

Installed TextSecure, successfully imported text messages from default SMS app, though no images were imported. Sent and received an unencrypted text message or two successfully, then attempted to send an image (unencrypted). Now, app does not open, &quot;Unfortunately, TextSecure has stopped&quot; immediately thrown on attempt to access.

At some point here Verizon will be updating more and more phones to Wi-Fi calling (&quot;Advanced Calling 1.0&quot;, as they have euhpamized). Will this be needed for all large carriers at that point for unecrypted sms? I think the Note 3 already has this.

		From time to time, I'm receiving messages in non-chronological order. In rare cases, messages are not transmitted at all which is now better to control since we have the reception confirmation. IMO these things have to do with the server implementation but could be solved in the client and protocol by referencing to the last message ID or similar. Using the latest Android client available on Google Play store.

		Not sure if it's already there because I couldn't really test for this feature... It would be nice to have TextSecure advertise its presence in the messages to everybody (not just the people who support TextSecure) just like OTR does - by adding a whitespace to the end to the SMS. This way I wouldn't need to know if my friends use TextSecure in order to turn it on.

		Hi So first of all, great app guys. I think this is the correct place to report this kind of behavior I was trying out the new Pushbullet OS X client and somehow noticed that I received 2 notifications when a new message arrived. I have TextSecure locked with a Passphrase. The first message/notification said &quot;encrypted message&quot; and the other one had the message itself in plain text. 😟 I thought the messages were encrypted while Textsecure is &quot;locked&quot;, am i wrong? thanks

		Hi, I'm testing the &quot;conflicts-ui&quot; branch. It has the new design, which I like, but I've noticed a &quot;bug&quot;. A friend of mine sent me a picture, ant it is not displayed in the center of the message bubble. It's aligned on the left side, leaving a lot of blank space on the right. It's not a big deal, but you know, you want things to be symmetrical...

		For a few days now, I always get a &quot;1 unread message&quot; notification after text secure locks automatically. It's always from the same contact, but there is no unread message. In fact we texted a lot in between. I can dismiss the message from the notification bar, but when I receive a message from somebody else, two unread messages appear: the new one and the &quot;always there message&quot;. Reboot did not solve the issue. Any ideas? Thanks in advance drohhyn

		A few days ago my sister told me that she could no longer send/receive MMS messages with TextSecure. I rarely use MMS so i tested it on my device and found out that it also doesn't work with me. (I get the red triangel if I try to send MMS and I can't download other people's MMS messages). We're not on the same mobile provider but it used to work on both with default settings. Here is my log, I can also provide my sister's if needed. https://gist.github.com/bungabunga/04eb3fd228beb4dc0df3

		Hello good people, sorry if this should be a duplicate. I've found a lot of issues concerned with sending or receiving problems, but nothing that quite matches my situation. The next best thing might be #2261. Here goes: When sending unencrypted SMS or encrypted Push messages to one of my contacts, I'm told that sending has failed. I asked that contact by other means to send me a message, which also failed, although he did not receive an error message, and I just received nothing at all. Afaict, only this contact is affected. Communication with all other contacts is possible by means of SMS. He is my only contact that uses / has installed Textsecure. Communication used to be possible without issues in the past (I have not communicated with this contact in a while, so I can't really say what version of TS and Android were used then, and what exactly might have changed since - sorry). As a shot in the blue, I deleted the conversation and started a new one, to no effect. Any hint or fix how to re-establish reliable communication is appreciated. Thanks in advance! My system: Cyanogenmod 11 M9 on a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini Textsecure version 2.4.2 Please let me know if more information (and what) is required.

		Hi, recently my Girlfriend (Galaxy S4, Android 4.4.2) and me (S3 mini, Android 4.1.2) both installed textsecure (2.4.2), I set it as my standard app for sms and she did not (we are both registerd for push). On Friday and Saturday she recieved what looks like encryptet SMS from me, however I did neither send those (and my phone doesn't show any sent sms), nor did she not recieve any (push) messages I did send. Since she doesn't open sms with TS, we don't know the plain text of these sms either (maybe there's method to decrypt them using our keys ?). Timestamps of push messages sent by me do not match the timestamps of her recieved sms. By now I have enable the checkbox to make TS ask me if it sends sms to another TS user, maybe that will actually resove the issue. I also tried manually sending a none encryptet sms and that works just fine. I'm not sure how to deal with this problem, my main concern is that TS may be sending SMS (I have to pay for) without me knowing about it.

		It would be nice to have a way to create a thread that can cleans the logs automatically based on timing. Not only that, it would be good to have a way to delete messages from the thread and affect both parties, something like Twitter does with the DMs. So a message that gets deleted in a peer-thread gets deleted on the other peer-thread.

		One of these commits give me problems: 8aa0f15 18d4d4d b3c42de 5836f35 dbd8a40 I built Textsecure from source today and now I get this error message all the time: 'Permanent textsecure communication failure' and 'Textsecure was unable to register with Google Play Services. Communication over t...' and 'Update Google Play services. This app won't run unless you update Google Play services.' But the messages are not true - Textsecure is working fine. No Problems, I can send and receive via push, via SMS. I also very much doubt that my playstore services is the problem - I am using 6.1.83. The build from yesterday morning does not have this problem. So one of the above mentioned commits must cause this.

		With the latest strings added to the TextSecure project on Transifex there is no way for me to correctly translate them to my language (Slovenian). Transifex has native support for plurals but it seems it only works if the original entries are added correctly. This worked on other projects but it doesn't work with TextSecure. From the Transifex documentation: &quot;Transifex has native support for plurals, as long as the format itself supports them. Formats that can deal with plurals are for instance Gettext and Android .xml files. When Transifex encounters a pluralized entry in the file, it will associate both plural forms together. This way, Transifex can present the translator with both forms in the editor. At the same time, Transifex knows how many plural forms each language has and asks the translator to fill in all of them. That is, the translator cannot save the entry, unless he fills in all plural forms in the specified language.&quot; http://docs.transifex.com/developer/formats/

		Hello, the app is getting better and better, I really like it. I have one small problem, I can't end a secure session, a friend has an account but he didn't use it anymore so I see him as a TS user and so I send all messages over push, if I don't send i via normal sms. When I click end secure session it sends the message that it has ended but it didn't change anything. A friend ask me if there is a support for iOS soon? I sent him the invite link over TS and a app was available but he cound't register? Thanks. Regards, Rene

		For whatever reason, TextSecure's MMS support is terrible. Everyone that I've shown TextSecure to has stopped using it because it loses MMS, crashes on receiving MMS, fails to download MMS, doesn't notify on receiving MMS, or some other long standing MMS related problem. We need an option to let the system handle MMS, while still letting TextSecure grab SMS.

		I know that SailfishOS is not yet (hopefully soon) a supported OS but using the playstore there to install TS and the play services TS works for sending messages to other TS instances yet I don't receive any messages. It worked a few days before so I'm not sure if 2.5.x changed something there. I understand that I don't get push notifications but at least I should get the messages when TS is running, right? I understand if nobody is willing to support me on this but I'd really like to find a workaround for this as other GCM based apps like Threema work in both directions so it should be possible. I'd provide any information needed if someone feels like helping me on this.

		I'm not sure if this is a good place for this, but I can't find anywhere else to leave feedback on the app. After the update a couple days ago, timestamps on recent messages became relative (e.g. &quot;8 minutes ago&quot;). This conveys less information, and the alternative (e.g. &quot;12:34PM Feb. 12&quot;) doesn't take up materially more room on the screen. What does &quot;1 hour ago&quot; mean? I haven't tested it, but reasonable people could come to conclusions anywhere between 31 minutes and an hour and 59 minutes ago. I'm using a Nexus 4, Android 5.0.1.

When I send messages I like to know that messages are actully received at the other end. With current setup I just don't know if it has, and even if we could get some kind of status icon/message it would be a lot nice if this is handled automaticly Thoughts? :)

		Often, when I receive group messages, some of the messages do not make it to the group chat screen. Instead, they arrive as what appears to be a non-group MMS seperate from the group chat with no contents other than a dowload button. If I click the download button and stay on that screen, the message eventually makes it to the group chat screen. However, the messages tends to show in the order that they've been dowloaded, not sent, which makes comprehending the conversation difficult. This problem appears to only occur with messages from non-TextSecure users, although I cannot say for sure. Only one of my contacts uses TextSecure.

		I installed Text Secure on my Galaxy Note 3, Android 4.4.4 and now the native Messaging SMS app will not let me send messages from it. It fills the text box with &quot;cannot send messages&quot; Also, Text Secure and the native Android Messaging app both ask if I want to set them as default when I use either. I have a Galaxy S3 and neither TS or Messaging ask for a default.

		I had some problems with the MMS settings of my provider so I tried some of the settings of TextSecure. Thereby I discovered that when I'm deleting an MMS (a picture) I wanted to send and receiving a message with an included picture,TextSecure shows me the deleted picture in the stream. Clicking on the image opens the right image.

		I recently installed Textsecure for the first time and was expecting to be asked about &quot;passphrase&quot; after searching the usual setup steps. I was asked about my phone number and got registered. I was also asked about importing the existing messages to Textsecure and setting up the app as my main sms app. However, any time that I am trying to use it, the lock beside my send arrow is open. I am not sure what I have done wrong or whether my friends should install it before having a secure text conversation. I understand that the project is dynamic but &quot;It is not easy to find a fast setup guide online.&quot;

			<description>
		Hello, I've read whole mailing list thread discussing and few tickets here on github of TextSecure, that explains that the feature is now gone. If I understand it correctly, in the same manner as RedPhone the feature of end-to-end encryption of SMS now works only if TextSecure is used with GCM/APN (textsecure-backend + signal-ios). If that's correct, would it be possible to bring this feature back as optional feature in application settings? I'm willing to invest time into putting the feature back into code, if the team of developers agree with it being put back in official releases on Google Play. I think that application with such large community is able to push the feature forward better, than forcing users to choose between TextSecure PUSH and eg. Tinfoil SMS GSM solution, using non-compatible ciphers (see the tinfoil-sms issue 70 [3]). Also using mobile networks is not reliable, as can be seen in many tickets here on github, as well as just thinking about Roaming cost and/or using textsecure on poor connectivity/without network connectivity. Related links: 1: https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/whispersystems/2015-01/msg00022.html 2: WhisperSystems#1762 3: tinfoilhat/tinfoil-sms#70 (comment) 4: WhisperSystems#2137

So I will restate the question here: A friend of mine has the problem that he doesn't receive TextSecure messages when he isn't on a wifi connection but on mobile network. For me that works fine. Does anyone have an idea how to solve this issue?

		Hi all! I'm running text secure 2.5.3 on a Moto G (XT1033 falcon_asia_ds). Running android 5.0 (LXB22,46-28). I'm using the app primarily as a texting replacement as none of my contacts use Text Secure. Debug log I've noticed that time stamps are extremely slow in updating. If I've sent a text, then navigated out of the app, then go back into the app after a number of minutes, chances are the time stamp shows &quot;now&quot; or &quot;1 min&quot; or whatever. The time stamp only updates after maybe 10-20 seconds. I've never noticed this problem on any other texting app.

		I am having significant reliability problems with TextSecure. I have installed the latest version along with two other users, and we all have enabled push messaging. With one user, there are no issues at all. We both appear in each other's list of TextSecure users, and can both send each other TextSecure messages. The second user also can send TextSecure messages to and receive TextSecure messages from the first user with no errors. What doesn't work is sending messages between myself and the second user. We do both appear in each other's list of TextSecure users, but his only option to send a message is &quot;Send secure SMS&quot; (no option to send a TextSecure message). I do have the option to send a TextSecure message (and it is the default, of course), but most of those that I do just show up as &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; on the other end (and all of the messages sent to this user take about twenty minutes to show up, whether the message actually makes it there, or there is just a &quot;Bad encrypted mesage&quot; notice). I don't understand why this isn't working, and don't have any idea about how to troubleshoot the problem.

		I am using TextSecure only as a messenger, not for unencrypted SMS. After having my SIM transferred to another phone, thus creating new key pairs, it sent messages to a TS contact via SMS, instead of doing its key exchange thing in the background. Is it supposed to do that? I'd rather have it show me some way to exchange the keys again and send messages via PUSH, than to blow up my SMS contingent. (Android 5.0, Motorola Moto X 2014/XT1092)

		Would it be possible to implement polling (e.g. every 15 minutes) until websocket support is available? I use this on Threema and it's almost as good as push and there is no heavy battery drainage. The load on the server shouldn't be too heavy as only few people are not using GCM. I really would like to switch to TextSecure, but as many others won't install Google Services for it.

		In group chats the scrolling behavior of TextSecure is unfavorable in my opinion. When I reopen a group chat after absence it is always scrolled all the way down to the most recent message. So in a group chat with a lot going on I have to manually scroll up to the point where I left the chat each time. Could this be fixed easily? For most of my friends this is the main show stopper that keeps us from moving our group from whatsapp.

		The Hebrew and Indonesian translation are not working. values-he should be renamed to values-iw and values-id should be renamed to values-in I didn't want to make a PR because I don't know how the transifex integration is working... From lint: ../../res/values-he: The locale folder &quot;he&quot; should be called &quot;iw&quot; instead; see the java.util.Locale documentation ../../res/values-id: The locale folder &quot;id&quot; should be called &quot;in&quot; instead; see the java.util.Locale documentation Priority: 6 / 10 Category: Correctness Severity: Warning Explanation: Wrong locale name. From the java.util.Locale documentation: &quot;Note that Java uses several deprecated two-letter codes. The Hebrew (&quot;he&quot;) language code is rewritten as &quot;iw&quot;, Indonesian (&quot;id&quot;) as &quot;in&quot;, and Yiddish (&quot;yi&quot;) as &quot;ji&quot;. This rewriting happens even if you construct your own Locale object, not just for instances returned by the various lookup methods. Because of this, if you add your localized resources in for example values-he they will not be used, since the system will look for values-iw instead. To work around this, place your resources in a values folder using the deprecated language code instead. More info: http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html

		The ConversationActivity currently uses isSms() as the value for the &quot;forceSms&quot; argument to MessageSender. This isn't accurate, since it means that undiscovered contacts won't be looked up before delivery. Also, I missed it in my first review, but SendButton shouldn't have a reference to the compose EditText.

		I'm in a similar boat to #1909 - I registered for OWS using a self-built RedPhone APK (because installing Google Apps to use a privacy system? What?), and now I find that I cannot (months later) subscribe to WhisperPush on CM11/12. I have been happily using a self-compiled TextSecure and did not miss the data channel because screw installing Spyware in order to use Privacy apps, but now that Signal opens up a realm of iPhone recipients I'm making an effort to get a data channel that's even halfway trustworthy: WhisperPush. When I try to subscribe by phone number, I get &quot;push server not reachable&quot;. My dad installed Signal and sees my wife and I as valid recipients, indicating that we're registered, which must be due to the prior Redphone experimentation. Reading around it seems that you can only be de-registered by uninstalling the app through Google Play, which is something I wish were made clear in the Github Readme for Redphone. Is installing Google Play only to install Redphone and then Uninstall Redphone and then be left with a google backdoor the only way I have available to register for WhisperPush?

			<description>
		I'm writing this in hope of you deciding to keep the MMS/SMS support. My personal experience of using the push messages has been poor. Too many times has my messages never arrived to the person I'm trying to contact. This problem has been catastrophic when the arrival of the message was critical. Even worse when it's a urgent message that needs quick response, this has occurred to me on several occasions; which in turn caused me some troubles (Multiple times)! Personally I can not describe me experience with regular SMS anywhere near as poor as the push messages. With regard to the poor experience with the push messages service and the severe limitations of the current plans; I do not believe your reasons warrant reason to remove support for MMS/SMS. I would rather have MMS/SMS only and drop the push messages. Worth mentioning: currently contacting friends who're out of the country renders TextSecure virtually useless because no one currently has the data plan enabled while roaming. Keeping it on MMS/SMS mode circumvents this problem. Regarding polling of new members; I don't see why the app still doesn't check for new contacts while using the MMS/SMS service, this can be worked around... Since I've had a poor experience with the push messages on several occasions; I've been using TextSecure as a MMS/SMS client which had support for OTR, I had it all working in one single app. If MMS/SMS is dropped from TextSecure; I'll likely discontinue my use of TextSecure.

		Hi, when I want to send a secure message to one of my contacts with sms and not over the internet I'm supposed to go to settings and disable &quot;Textsecure-Messages&quot;. After that my messages are transported with sms. But when I want to send them over the internet I'm supposed to register again by textsecure. So I would request a feature that I can select in a conversation how the message is transported.

		Hello, a friend of mine has an older Smartphone with Android 4.1.2 on it. She is not able to afford a new phone so easily. The latest TextSecure version available for this Android version is only 2.5.3. This raises some questions: a) Did newer versions of TextSecure, drop support for older APIs? b) If older API versions are not supported, why hasn't it been announced? c) TextSecure 2.5.3 is not able to send pictures (text messages are working). I this cause support has been dropped or should a bug been filed (incompatible server change?)

		Currently, a small box with a tick in it appears next to the timestamp when a message has been delivered. An additional indication when the recipient has read the message (maybe like iMessage?) would be nice. Users should probably be able to opt into (or out of?) sending read receipts. (See #866.)

		In 2.7.0+, now that encrypted SMS is no longer a thing, some of the strings for settings are a bit confusing. In particular, there should no longer be a distinction between &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot; SMS settings. I'm also not sure about the description of the Push message setting, given that it's the primary feature of the app. Maybe change it to &quot;Disable TextSecure messages&quot; or something?

		In version 2.7.0, secure SMS functionality has been removed. When composing a new message, TS still displays Send unsecured SMS. Since there is no longer a secured SMS, this might confuse new users. Perhaps it would be best to change it to Send SMS, or change it somehow to reflect that TextSecure messages are secure and SMS is not.

		Sometimes you maybe forced to hand out your password to people like government agencies. In this case it would be really nice to have a second fake password. This fake password will only give acces to some fake messages which dont contain any informations that you try to keep secret. Basically like an hidden truecrypt volume.

		I really dislike your latest decision to stop support for encrypted SMS/MMS. Not because I don't like push messages - I simply do not want to install google services. In my opinion it makes your whole effort for encrypted communications a farce - but this is just my point of view. Now I read in your blog that you are going to handle message delivery by yourselves. This is really nice. One thing though: You want to go for GCM for wakeup events - That means GCM would be mandatory for TextSecure. What about using a different mechanism - a periodically check, manual check, whatever. As long as GCM would be optional I would be very glad, lot's of other ppl possibly as well and this would be a good compromise for the gone encrypted SMS. So, would you please consider making GCM for wake up events optional while providing encrypted push through your own services without the need of google services? Would really appreciate that. Thanks.

		Hi! I re-flashed my Nexus 5 from rooted stock ROM KitKat 4.4 to CyanogenMod 12 (cm-12-20150308-NIGHTLY-hammerhead, based on Android 5.0.2). Before flashing, I made a TitaniumBackup Pro backup also from TextSecure in order to migrate my private key as well as the settings I would have lost otherwise. Basically, TextSecure v2.5.3 is working after restoring via TitaniumBackup Pro on CM12. What works: sending encrypted PUSH messages sending encrypted text messages sending unencrypted text messages receiving encrypted text messages receiving unencrypted text messages However, some things are not working any more, most annoying: I can not receive any encrypted push messages: What stopped working: receiving encrypted PUSH messages notifications that my PUSH messages arrived at my peers TextSecure I don't think that my issues are related to CM12 nightly since text messages (encrypted or unencrypted) are working fine. I don't use any Android firewall or Android permission overruling settings/app (yet).

Try sending and receiving via that app successfully (via GV data). Set TextSecure as default. Receving works fine, but sending gets stuck, with long-press msg details showing: Sent - Via Pending... (I wasn't trying on totally fresh phone wipe, but I can retry that later if it would uncomplicate things.) Expected Behaviour It seemed that the Voice+ system app allowed any regular SMS app to send/receive using Google Voice. I'll have to look into how TS might act differently.

		I'm using TextSecure to write messages to contacts in different languages. The problem is that the auto completion of the built-in keyboard gets in the way when using the keyboard for wrong language (e.g. writing German on an English keyboard). It is already very useful that I can change the language of the keyboard by holding down the space bar. Requested feature: However, it would be really nice if TesxtSecure could remember for each contact which language I'm using with it and automatically switch to the correct keyboard when I start writing a message to a contact. That would save me from switching the keyboard manually (which I realize I need to do usually only after it garbled my first sentence to gibberish). Is that possible? What do others think?

		Base data TextSecure version: 2.6.4 Device: Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini (GT-I9195)) Android version: 4.4.2 (vendor ROM) Relevant settings: Push registered and enabled Incoming SMS enabled (use TS as standard app) Outgoing SMS to text secure contacts when there is no internet access available (fallback). Ask before sending. Detailed description of issue Since the update to TS 2.6.4 the fallback from Push to SMS (if there is no internet connection available) has stopped working. When I send the push, the message comes up as normal (&quot;Do you want to use SMS...?&quot;). If I confirm that I want to use SMS, the message turns to the usual green, indicating SMS mode, but after a while switches to blue (Push message). If I look into the &quot;Message details&quot; screen, it too says that it used the Push data channel. (As a footnote: the &quot;Message details&quot; screen doesn't respect the displkay/design options as well. I have TS set to the dark theme, the &quot;Message details&quot; screen, however, uses the bright theme. Maybe this contributes to the problem.) It's not just a display issue either: TS does use the push data channel although I tell it to do SMS. Once I turn on the internet connection, the message is delivered via push to the recipient (they confirm that they received them).

		Ok folks, with todays update of TextSecure to version 2.7.1 the real disappointment happened: Only unencrypted conversations are still possible, we are forced to register! You silently removed encrypted SMS (not mentioned on GooglePlay)! TextSecure Messages are NOT possible without Google Play Services. So that means: Phones of privacy-aware users that are very likely rooted and have no Google Play Services are being &quot;set on fire&quot; by just disabling the encryption of all conversations, not notifying the user that the whole encryption thingy has just vanished. Furthermore, people are being forced to register with the TextSecure Messages Server based in the USA. The people (like me) who refuse to flash GApps for adding Google Play Services (because they know that with those services you enable Google to remotely monitor your phone) are just doomed in this case. @moxie0, I've always loved TextSecure and RedPhone, but this is just unacceptable for privacy-aware people like me. I wonder what wistleblowers would say to this. Nevermind, I already complained too much. Uninstalled. Good bye. 😢

I figured I had to click each button to make sire everbody received my meaningful braindump. But it turns out that every button seams to resend the message to the entire group. So everybody received 15 times the same message. Could the resending not be handled automatically?

		I have supported TextSecure since the beginning, version 1.0. I started using it because it was a way to encrypt SMS messages. Now, it is just another encrypted IM chat program, unable to do SMS, and its original point its lost. It should not be called TextSecure anymore... Call it &quot;Signal for Android&quot; or something and fork TextSecure at version 2.6... I do not have a data plan. I do not have google apps installed. I can not use my favorite app anymore. I was SO ANGRY today and also so sad because something i loved just died. Moxie, you are making a HUGE mistake. Some people don't want to use Gapps. Some people don't have a data plan. Some people travel through areas where they can't get data but the standard SMS channel is available. Some people don't want to use limited data when they can use their unlimited SMS plan. These people were just told to go fuck themselves. I feel offended, insulted, hurt. These people are probably either highly security-conscious users who don't trust google or people who just don't want a data plan... they are not the enemy, Moxie, they WERE loyal users of TextSecure. You could still develop the push system without taking away the SMS fallback system. There should at least be a fallback system. And for security, what protects us from man-in-the-middle attacks now? If keys can be reissued whenever what stops a man-in-the-middle from distorting the keys to trigger a new swap then capturing the new keys? I don't feel comfortable with the push system even if I could use it. THIS IS A TEXT MESSAGING APP, not a damn chat program. I DONT CARE IF THE TELCOS HAVE METADATA ON ME. Why do you think you can force me to care about that? I care much more about not having Gapps on my phone. It is a sad day... so sad.

		Since version 2.7 or so, TextSecure has become very unreliable. Half the messages I should receive don't come through unless I deactivate/reactivate data.

		hi. i made the mistake of updating textsecure to the latest version on google play (as of today) and now every time i open it there's a huge blue nag screen section right at the top. there is no way to close it, like in the previous version. dear developers. for the love of god. why? i will never ever ever enable textsecure messages, because (in no particular order, they're all important equally): sms is free and unlimited i only rarely connect to wifi sms is free and unlimited i don't want to register my phone number sms is free and unlimited the people i talk to using textsecure only connect to wifi rarely sms is free and unlimited in previous versions there was the option to disable the nag screen, and even then it was temporary. when you least expected it it popped back up. why? for those who don't need or want this feature, why are you trying to push it down the throat? i really appreciate the time and effort you (the devs) put into this app but why are you trying so hard to turn into google, facebook and the like? i thought textsecure was about freedom of expression and freedom of choice. was i wrong?

I have a phone that does not offer Google Play Services and thus in the recent update 2.7.1, All my contacts lost the ability to reach me privately. With no data connection as part of my providers plan and only Wifi access in certain areas I relied on Textsecure as a 24/7 secure channel to contact me on. I would like to see SMS added as a advance mode enabled option or could someone point me to another app or fork that allows me to send messages using the same crypto scheme.

		Hey Team, Sorry for this, but I did not found any statements to the question on which timeframe (or milestone) Signal for android will be coming, including Textsecure and Redphone? I found this question more than once, but no official answer, just guesses. Any updates on this topic? Regards Mawed EDIT: Sorry I did not meant to open a discussion. It was meant more like a &quot;feature&quot; request. (Maybe it is plant to be on Version 3.0, regardless how much steps between there will be....) Sorry for asking at the wrong place and stealing your time.

Check out our Support Center Interested in the source code? Take a look at our github page maybe some copyright stuff?

		On gingerbread the message bubble seems too small during the download of attachments (tested in the emulator). Can you confirm this on a real device?

		I can't send secure sms to my friends that don't have push enabled. The only option is to send insecure sms. If this is not a bug but a feature, how can I exchange secure messages now with those friends?

		Kill the gapps (google) dependancies. Folk with hardened roms like to be gapps free, and those who have hardened roms are gapps free for a very good reason. By making your app gapps free, both types of user can use your app, those who &quot;trust&quot; google, and those who trust themselves.

		TS user on 2.5.3, which is registered, sends me TS message. To this message, I can't reply. Moxie closed the issue #2730 with explanation, that the first user is not registered... but he is. In his contact list he sees his TS users and is able to send them TS message (not encrypted SMS). In my case, after receiving the message, I have the option to reply (TS - blue arrow, not SMS) but the message is not sent. Afterwards the blue arrow vanishes and I am offered to send only normal SMS.

		Hangouts is the default Google chat client, and most people I know communicate via gtalk rather than sms. ChatSecure is very rough compared to TextSecure, and it's repelling to non-tech-savvy users to have 2 clients. Consider supporting XMPP in TextSecure too, so we can use the one client for messaging, as a full and transparent replacement for Google Hangouts?

		Hello, the current TextSecure-Android version does have gray and blue message bubbles. I do not really like that and find it uncomfortable to read with those colors, especially with the current choice of the chat background color (WhisperSystems#2773). Could you please add an option to change the message bubble colors? Oh, and before you say &quot;But we need those colors to indicate which kind of messaging channel is being used (Data/SMS) and to indicate if the messages are encrypted or not!&quot; or something like that (WhisperSystems#945), let me say this: I don't think colors should be used for that. I think those things should rather be indicated via icons, not via message bubble colors. And I don't use TextSecure for SMS anyway (IMHO TextSecure should have removed the entire SMS support, both, encrypted as well as unencrypted). It would be much appreciated if you could add an option to change the message bubble colors. Regards

		Just installed TextSecure on my wife's phone but left it with SMS and MMS disabled by default until we could configure everything and transition her over. However, just today, she got group MMS messages from friends that were unable to be downloaded in her default MMS app. Upon investigation, opening TextSecure, I saw those messages downloaded in TextSecure even though it shouldn't have. It appears somehow TextSecure is pulling down MMS when it shouldn't. It wasn't all messages in the thread, which left some messages in the default MMS app and others inside TextSecure for some reason. Samsung Galaxy S3 CDMA, Android 4.4.2.

		I noticed the following behavior with Push Messages: When having limited or no Internet connection while someone sends you a message, the message gets delivered multiple times after the connection is restored. I don't know about the inner workings of TextSecure but is it possible, that TextSecure tries to resend the Message after some time has passed without a receipt? If so, then maybe the received messages should be checked by using some kind of unique ID so duplicates can be deleted automatically.

		I'm really missing the &quot;seen&quot; indicator which is available at Threema (eye symbol). This inform me, when the recipient of the message really have red the message. It makes me sure that really the recipient has received the message, not only his mobile. This makes sending an acknowledgment back (e.g. &quot;OK&quot;) superfluous. Additionally a setting is probably needed to deactivate sending these &quot;seen&quot;-indicator for those, who don't want this behaviour and keep their privacy.

		Please add an option to switch between Textsecure-mode and SMS-mode, like there is one in hangouts (by Google). There may be some cases where sending an SMS is preferable although both parties have Textsecure. Lets make an example: In case one side has no internet connection (e.g. in foreign contries) but may recieve SMSs. It would be great to be able to sent the person this message through Textsecure especially because this app aims to replace the default SMS-App.

		Hello, I've vouched for this feature a lot, so I'll just write it here as a feature request hoping someone would take it seriously. We're a group of activists in an oppressive regime, trying to establish an IM-type of secure medium to communicate our initiatives among each other. TextSecure has been, theoretically, the ideal medium for us for so long. Yet, we never used it because it requires Phone Numbers. Hashed or not, our problem with that is not a &quot;trust&quot; problem against the server, but the problem is that if one of us is searched/caught, there's absolutely zero plausible deniability for him to deny his immediate knowledge if the people he's communicating with. The oppressor can simply collect the phone numbers I have on my phone (after a good beating to make me unlock the app from its passphrase), and take down all of the group. We need the ability to use usernames (preferably also making an option to FORCE Tor before the app can download or upload ANYTHING). That way, if one is caught, he won't be (as much of) a danger to us all, as if he had all our phone numbers in the chat screen. He will be able to use his cover story to deny and save us and maybe even himself. Please consider that. We're struggling to get a secure medium for our communication. XMPP is not the way to go when it comes to Group Chat, and other Closed Source apps are just never the correct go-to app. This app is absolutely perfect, if only it allows us to completely get rid of phone numbers. Not just for people whom I don't have their phone numbers, but even for my contacts that are in my phone book. We need a way to not reference phone numbers in TextSecure AT ALL. Please make it happen. If I had what I could benefit you with, I'd gladly offer it, but unfortunately I'm not able to offer anything back to this great community of developers.

		I can't send SMS, when I do it just sits there (sometimes for hours). No red triangle, no error... just sits there. I thought this was because of &quot;delivery reports&quot;, but toggling this has no effect on sending SMS. This doesn't always happen. Sometimes SMS works just fine, but for the most part, it just sits there. I don't know if this is a TextSecure issue or an issue with my phone (or provider) in general. Not sure if this log has anything useful in it: https://gist.github.com/22a283d889ab9c8d15b0 P.S. I was having MMS issues before, so I don't know if that's related.

		In the past i have been able to use TextSecure to encrypt my SMS without having be online at all times. Recently i lost the ability to communicate by encrypted SMS with a lot of people close to me because they got their TextSecure updated. So i had to install some of the most intrusive of the Google Apps to be able to update Textsecure - only to find out that it doesn't do encrypted SMS any longer. I just can not understand how Open Whisper Systems can deliver us to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and its constant tracking when this opens us to abuse by all the three letter agencies that we now know about thanks to Snowden. Please reenable key exchange and encrypted messaging using SMS.

		TextSecure 2.9.2 Android 4.4.2 Samsung SGH-T399 When verifying a phone number, there is no way to cancel if you are having issues, except by clicking on &quot;Edit +[phone number]&quot; and then exiting from that screen. The physical back button on my phone doesn't work either. I'd suggest adding a back arrow on the upper bar to return to the previous activity. Maybe the back button should only be visible when text message registration fails? Attached is a picture of the activity.

Though, there is a workaround: touch and hold untild the image message is selected/marked and now move finger while still holding some way up or down until scrolling has been triggered. Now release - selection should be still active.

		I don't know how long, but today (newest textsecure update from playstore) I realised that I could not send encrypted sms anymore. My wife has textsecure too (android 5.0 too) and we only wanna use it for encrypted sms (push messages not activated). But till now we could only send unencrypted sms and there is no way to reenable the encryption. Also for other contacts which use plain sms apps, there is not even a way to try to start a secure sms chat. I only could send an invitation to install the app.

		I'm not absolutely sure, but I think in some former version of TS (maybe before dropping encrypted SMS) TS would aks if it should fall back to SMS if no data connection was detected. I have an ongoing chat with a friend where this happended when I send him a message and had not data connection at that moment. Today I tried the same (send a message to a TS contact while no data connection available) with this results: TS does not ask what to do TS wants to send a encrypted message which will never succeed as long as device is offline TS seems to have no timeout, so even after waiting for verly long no fallback to SMS Sending manually a SMS is bad for 2 reasons: First - normaly I dont want to use SMS, so I intuitivly I want to just send a message thinking it will go out over data channel. Second - I had to use this issue-tracker to find out how to accomplish sending a SMS within an ongoing encrypted chat.... its kind of hidden.) Suggestion: just ask the user via a pop-up what to do in situations where no data connection is available: Send over SMS right away (only unencrypted) Wait and send encrypted as soon as data connection becomes available (additionally: remember decision for this chat/for all chats)

		For some reason it's apparently not uncommon to get the generally well-known &quot;invalid package&quot; error ONLY with TextSecure, recently. I can seemingly install/update any other applications marked as compatible in the Google Play Store (that I've tried so far) on my devices just fine. Both myself and another user have reported this on support.whispersystems.com, in http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/11557972-version-mismatch-messages-unreadable-with-automatic-updates-from-google-play-at-both-ends and http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/questions/11567106-invalid-package-error-on-install . I have three Android 2.3.x devices exhibiting this behaviour, two Samsung GT-S5690 and one HTC Desire HD A9191, with latest updates applied to each. Android 2.3.6 / GINGERBREAD.XXNA1 on the S5690s Android 2.3.5 / 3.12.405.1 on the A9191. User &quot;DM4N&quot; only reported &quot;HTC Desire HD&quot; and &quot;latest updates&quot;, I don't know if there exist different variants of this model name. My main phone is still running a 2.5 series TextSecure due to this. Wife's on 2.9.3 as of today, she has a newer phone with a 4.something Android...

		Hi, I am using TextSecure on Android (2.10.1). A friend of mine has sent me a video through the Signal app for iOS (via push), but I don't seem to be able to open it. All I can see is a bubble with the video icon (not a preview of the video, just an icon saying it's a video). When I click on it, I am asked if I want to temporarily copy it to the disk etc, I say 'yes', the default video player loads and then closes itself in a couple of seconds, saying that &quot;an error occurred&quot;. This may have something to do with the fact that when my friend sent the video my connection was really bad/absent, though one would expect the application to retry until the attachment has been properly downloaded (but maybe this is not the point). Thank you

		Hello, I have not yet had the chance to use the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer (2f20bb8) myself, since TextSecure 2.10.x still seems to be in beta. But I now saw that you seem to be using the Google Emojis for the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer, or at least I assume that's what you are doing by looking at this: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/tree/master/assets There is an issue with this though. Signal-iOS of course is using the Apple Emojis. And they sometimes look very different from the Google Emojis. You can see a comparison between the Apple Emojis and the Google Emojis over there: http://www.explodedsoda.com/2013/07/ios-to-google-hangout-emoji-comparison.html As you can see, they sometimes look very different. So they can easily get lost in translation. There is an whole article about this issue, which describes the issue quite well, see the following article: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html There are some alternative Emoji sets available though, which look more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set does. And they even are open source. For example: There is the Twitter Emoji set called &quot;Twemoji&quot;, see: https://blog.twitter.com/2014/open-sourcing-twitter-emoji-for-everyone https://github.com/twitter/twemoji The Twemoji set looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set, see the following comparison for example: http://mroth.github.io/emojicompare/ As you can see, the Twemoji set looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set does. And there also is the &quot;Emoji One&quot; Emoji set, see: http://emojione.com/ https://github.com/Ranks/emojione The Emoji One Emoji set also looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set. Here is a big comparison chart where you can compare them (the chart even has the Twemoji set and the Google Emoji set): http://emoji.codes/family As you can see, the Twemoji set and the Emoji One set are both more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set is. So, could you please use the Twemoji or Emoji One Emoji set or something similar in TextSecure-Android instead of using the Google Emoji set, to lessen the risk of them getting lost in translation (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html) when chatting with Signal-iOS users? It would be much appreciated. Regards

		Hello, the blue toolbar at the top of every screen in TextSecure casts a shadow. I realize that this probably comes from material design. But the shadow in TextSecure is quite strong up to a point where it is distracting, especially when it is covering messages. I had a look at some other material design apps. Maybe there might be some material design apps which have a shadow as strong as TextSecure does, but the ones that I had a look at all had a much more subtle shadow to their toolbar. And some material design apps I had a look at did not even have a shadow for their toolbar. And I just noticed that even the TextSecure dark theme does not seem to have a shadow for it's toolbar. So, could you please reduce the shadow of the toolbar in the TextSecure light theme to make it more subtle? It would be much appreciated. Regards

		In my mind the &quot;Verify identity&quot; screen as it is right now (showing two fingerprints) is not compliant with the second Development Ideology. The user doesn't know what a key is. I propose the following solution which is much easier to understand for a user while providing the same amount of security: Show the QR code that is being displayed when clicking &quot;Get my key scanned&quot; instead of the fingerprints Add a &quot;Scan their identity&quot; button that opens &quot;Scan their key to compare&quot; For me it would also be acceptable to have an advanced mode which shows the fingerprints but that doesn't really comply with the third Development Ideology. PS: I'd also appreciate having an indication showing if I have already verified the identity of the person I'm chatting with. Maybe by showing the action bar in the chat activity in orange if not verified?

		For some reason I don't know, textsecure is extremely slow at sending messages when on wifi. On 3g it works fine (it's not as fast as other apps I've tried, but it's acceptable), but the situation on wifi is &quot;concerning&quot;. When I send messages (especially if I send many, one after the other), it looks like it takes a while (several seconds) for textsecure to start sending the data, like I wasn't connected to the internet, but I am. In the notification bar, I don't see the upload/download arrows highlighted, it's like it's not even trying to connect. Sometimes it takes less time to turn on and back off airplane mode to fix the issue than to wait until it starts sending the data. The wifi works perfectly fine, by the way. Thank you

If I get a notification and use the Andoird Acticity indicator to read the new message, the TextSecure Conversation is empty at first (white) and can only be accessed upon clicking on the screen or going back to the main menu. Running on Cm 11 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1c6de393931e4bb41ee9

		I'm asking this here since the forum (http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/topics/629248-general-questions/questions) seems pretty much dead. When will you start merging textsecure and redphone into signal? Which feature do you plan to add to textsecure before you start? Is the merge already happening on some other repository? Thank you

		I have text secure running on 2 android phones. One phone I use for work (MMB Gingerbread 2.3.7) the other is for private use (CM11). Both phones have a SIM card that uses the same number (in Germany called Dual-SIM). I migrated the text-secure setup from private phone via Titanium backup to the work phone. There was no new key-generation process on the work phone required. Btw. the work phones firmware is also missing the google-services so a reauthorisation is not possible at all. When I talk about messaging this means transport via Internet. Steps to reproduce: Start conversation on my private phone. Outgoing messages from my private and my work phone always receipt successful. Incoming encrypted messages on my private phone are fine Incoming encrypted messages on my work phone are always corrupted (Bad encrypted message).

		Hello, the Emoji drawer / keyboard toggle icon: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_grey600_24dp.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_white_24dp.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_keyboard_grey600_24dp.png is (or are) smaller than the Emoji category icons in the Emoji drawer. It looks inconsistent. Also, the Emoji toggle icon (the smiley): https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_grey600_24dp.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_mood_white_24dp.png is a different smiley than the smiley icon which is being used for the Emoji people category icon in the Emoji drawer (the smiley between the clock and the flower). That also looks inconsistent. In Telegram for Android, the Emoji drawer / keyboard toggle icon has the same size as the Emoji category icons in the Emoji drawer. And the Emoji drawer toggle icon in Telegram for Android uses the same smiley that is being used for the Emoji people category icon in the Emoji drawer (the smiley between the clock and the flower). Which looks and feels more consistent. So, could you please increase the size of the Emoji drawer / keyboard toggle icon in TextSecure, to make it match the size of the Emoji category icons in the Emoji drawer? And could you please replace the Emoji drawer toggle smiley with the same smiley that is being used for the Emoji people category icon in the Emoji drawer (the smiley between the clock and the flower)? Regards

		Hello, the Emoji drawer in TextSecure is wasting space on the left and right side. As you can see on the following screenshot for example: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5326916/7094948/5b3b4470-dfc6-11e4-82a7-206899989f75.png (Source) there is a lot of empty space on both the left as well as on the right side. Also the vertical scrollbar is not placed directly on the outside of the Emoji drawer. There is a lot of empty space between the right outside and the scrollbar. Even when I reduce the system font size to minimum, which makes the Emojis smaller, I only get up to seven Emojis in one row on a display with 1080 pixels in width. In comparison: Telegram for Android does not waste as much space on the left and right side of it's Emoji drawer and has the vertical scrollbar placed almost directly on the right side without having so much empty space between it and the right outside. And in Telegram for Android I get eight Emojis in one row. Could you please shift the vertical scrollbar more to the right and use the empty space on the left and right side for actual content (i.e. Emojis), so that the space is not being wasted? It would be much appreciated. Regards

		Hello, the TextSecure Emoji drawer renders outside of the visible screen area in certain circumstances. Unfortunately I couldn't make a screenshot of it because I saw it happen on someone else's device. It was a HTC Desire (Bravo) with an 3.7 inch 480×800 pixel screen running TextSecure 2.10.2 on an unofficial 4.4.4 KitKat based CyanogenMod 11.0 ROM with system font size set to maximum. When the Emoji drawer was set to the recent (clock icon) category or to the people (smiley icon) category, then everything seemed to be fine. But when the Emoji drawer was set to another category, like the nature (flower icon) category for example, then the Emoji drawer was growing a bit towards the left side of the screen, essentially making it render outside of the visible screen area (it became wider than the actual screen width). On a LG G2 with stock 4.4.2 KitKat ROM, this does not happen. So maybe it's related to the low screen resolution of the HTC Desire (Bravo). Again, I couldn't take a screenshot, but maybe you can reproduce it in an emulator or something like that when setting the screen resolution to 480x800 and setting system font size to maximum. Could you please fix it? Regards

		Hi, I've always wondered why this is, but just figured it may be some sort of bug. Like 80% of the time, the messages I send get the delivery receipt symbol (the check mark) &quot;way&quot; before they turn blue (meaning they have been sent). Basically I send a message, it is shown as pending, it gets the delivery check mark, and then it is shown as sent. And this happens all the time, way more than just half the time. I thought messages turned blue after they'd reached the server, and got the check mark once they'd been delivered. But how is it possible that going from my phone to the recipient's phone and back takes less than going from my phone to the server and back? Sometimes I get the delivery receipt several seconds before the message is marked as sent. Is this some problem with the server being slower at some tasks than others, or is it some problem with the client? Thank you

		Hi TextSecure volunteers, thanks for your work. since moving to an IP-based protocol I have wished I could leave my phone number entirely behind and use an alternative identity uid/token for myself. phone numbers themselves are a private token that users may wish to not reveal. is this something that is being considered? it would be fine if TextSecure refused to handle conventional sms/mms in this configuration.

		Prior versions appeared to allow encrypted smses that were sent without using the internet... once the public keys had been obtained online. This feature is much needed as certain country areas don't have reliable mobile internet or users may have the internet turned off (to save battery life even) and it's a real pain to get messages from other TextSecure users hours or days late once the internet is available again. Please bring back this feature.

		Hello I created a group in TextSecure and the group worked well for over week. My Textsecure then crashed and I had to clear data and clear cache and re-register to get Textsecure to work again. Now I get Unnamed Group instead of the old group name where group messages come I get messages from the other group members but cannot reply to them or post pictures, video etc to the group. If I recreate the Group name and add the people to it they get a totally new group called Unnamed Group which we can all post to but that is unpleasing to all! This is really frustrating Has Text secure assigned a new administrator for the group? If so who and how do I get back on? It was me that convinced the whole group to leave WhatsApp for a more secure app!

		Hope this is not a dup. On the last couple of text secure updates (on the Droid Turbo at least). The emoticons are very messed up. Best description I can give is that if I had a tic-tac-toe grid of emoticons, The new text secure app is centering on the intersections of the grid. So for each emoticon, I see a quarter of each emoticon around the grid intersection.

		I sent a messge in an existing conversation, and it was not sent with a warning that the contact's fingerprint had changed. The option i was given was to 'verify identity', at which point the message was sent. While in the warning state, i couldn't find a way to either view the new fingerprint of the contact so that I could confirm it out of band, or prevent the pending message from being sent when I verified identity in order to see the new fingerprint.

		Since version 2.10.x, the emojis key (in the left of the input field) is always present even if the device has a emoji capable keyboard like the Google keyboard. On my nexus 4 (android 5.1 gogole keyboard), after the 2.10.x update I have this left emoji key which is less convenient than the keyboard emoji key. Plus the keyboard emoji key save the most used emojis for all applications. The emoji drawer integrated in TextSecure only save the most used for TextSecure, I think it's not really convenient. This issue seems to be related to 2f20bb8 Dear developers, can you please use the emojis capable keyboard if it's available or add an option to use the TextSecure emoji drawer or not use ? Thanks for reading this.

Shouldn't the app have noticed this? Does the app just go by the keys stored? I deleted the thread and text still come in the same. I even ended the session. Will we both have to delete the app and start over? Seems like a security flaw. When she calls her new number shows up.

		First of all, I apologize if this is a duplicate of #981. I would like the developers to work on making TS a real instant messenger. Right now, even assuming everything goes well when sending a message, it still takes way (way!) more than other popular messengers. I don't know if it's because of the encryption or because of what mentioned in 981, or something else. What I know is that from the second I hit send, it takes some time before the message appears in the conversation, then some time to get sent and some time to get delivered (though usually the last two are inverted). It takes too long. Now, &quot;some time&quot; isn't a minute, but the process of sending is not at all instantaneous. I am basically begging my friends to use textsecure, but they keep complaining because &quot;no way, it's too slow&quot;. To which I don't know what to answer. It does feel much slower than whatsapp. Is this because you don't have enough servers? Or is it a problem of the client itself?

		Hello, it would be really nice if it was possible to swipe left/right in conversations to reach the next/previous conversation in the list. It would be like having a tab-like system, similar to (but not the same as) what surespot does. For example, if I opened the second conversation in the list, swiping right would take me to the first one and swiping left would take me to the third one. This would make it easier to text 2+ people at the same time. Of course it's not a priority, just a thought.

		I have read some closed/locked issues on this matter already, but I just want to add an extra push. There was argument that TextSecure is to be a secure messaging facility, and fallback to insecure communication is unacceptable. I want to argue that this position is unreasonable, and undermines the effort to get the general public onto secure platforms. The general public has practically zero concern about this; but I do. If text secure refuses to fallback to SMS, then nobody I want to communicate will install the app. The inconvenience of not being able to communicate when out of 3G range (I'm in Australia, we barely have internet in this country), or have exhausted your monthly data allowance (again, I'm in Australia), is more than anyone should have to tolerate. There is only one reasonable solution to this as I see it: TextSecure should attempt to send a message securely. If it can't, a popup informs the user it failed to send, and the user has an option to retry later, or send insecurely (via SMS) immediately. There should also be a &quot;remember my choice&quot; checkbox, and an option in the settings. I have people refusing to install, and uninstalling the app. TextSecure is the only decent, otherwise user-friendly, secure messaging app I have managed to find. All others are borked in various critical ways. Please consider the importance of this app actually being used by an exponential explosion of users; 99% of whom don't give a damn whether it's secure, but must be convinced to use it by the 1% of people who do.

		Hello, I just installed latest TextSecure and if I knew what it does, I would backup the APK file. Unfortunately, I didn't and the change involving the removal of SMS encryption feature was not mentioned in the changelog, so I unwillingly removed a feature from my phone that I really care about. Is there a way to restore the SMS encryption, either by installing an older APK or by changing that using some hidden option? I evaluated the risks and while being a security conscious man, I would prefer to use outdated software in this case than no encryption at all - encryption using the internet is unfortunately out of option for me. I really hope that somebody could help me, otherwise I would have to compile textsecure myself, which doesn't seem trivial. I am willing to donate to the project if this feature can be restored on my phone. Jacek

		We live in times where even the fact that somebody's using encryption raises suspicions. In my eyes a first suspicious sign would be a telephone number which is stored in a database of a messenger like TextSecure. Gathering those is a low hanging fruit because we all know that the structure of telephone numbers is very deterministic and entropy of those is additionally reduced by TextSecure. Another reason is that some people just don't like that everyone who has ones telephone number knows that TextSecure is used. I suggest to give more control over that. The easiest solution I can imagine is that there's a &quot;cloak&quot; mode: Alice uses TextSecure. However, she doesn't want that Mallory knows that Alice is using that App so Alice activates the cloak mode. In this mode, every time Mallory searches for intersections on the server Alices token is ignored. To get in touch with a cloaked user, I suggest the following approach: Bob wants to contact Alice. Alice is still in cloaking mode. Bob can select Alice from his phone contacts for a contact request. Alice receives this request. If she acknowledges, Bob get notified that Alice is available. If Alice ignores the request, nothing happens. Other, less convenient solutions I thought of: It's not possible that Mallory can see Alice in the intersection request if Alice doesn't have Mallory in her contact list. (Here the server whould have to know and store contact link information which is bad.) There's a kind of challenge-response technique via another channel than TextSecure which allows Bob to add Alice to the contacts. (More complicated and requires a second channel) What do you think? Greetings, Noir

		Hey, my girlfriend and I have been using TextSecure for ages now. Somehow, with her HTC One M8 she can't send me messages when our phones are in our WLAN at home - her messages instantly get a red exclamation mark. Mine work and she receives them perfectly. When the WiFi on her phone is turned off, it continues to work again. Anyone ever experienced this before?

		My TS crashes everytime when i send or recieve an uncrypted SMS. Then it keeps crashing when I enter my password. Same behaviour when I delete all data from the app (via settings) and start over with a &quot;clean&quot; app. So it seems it has nothing to do with previous messages. The only solution to open TS again without crashing is to restore a Titanium Backup. System: Oneplus One (bacon) with Cyanogenmod 12.1-20150505-nightly (Android 5.1.1). The Bug also affeced the previous 3 nighlies.

		When typing a message longer than a single line, TextSecure allows the user to scroll the input box left and right in order to see the whole input. It would be nice if instead of this scrolling function the box simply gained another line as the length of the message increased. This would allow the user to always see the entire message without scrolling. While this would take up slightly more vertical space, this would be especially useful when reviewing the message before sending (say, to make sure nothing was autocorrected incorrectly). Plus, TextSecure already increases the input area, though only to show the number of characters when they go past the 160 character mark. Thanks.

		In a group message (at least unsecured, not sure if true in secure chats), the &quot;Group members&quot; view shows a list of contacts and unknown numbers involved in the message. Each entry is clickable, and closes the view. I would think the expected behavior on unknown numbers should be to add a number to contacts, similar to tapping their avatar in a message. Assuming that person ever actually participates in the thread, it's a somewhat moot point, as you'll be able to tap the avatar, but I've had situations where a group member doesn't participate, so the shortcut of adding a contact isn't available. For existing contacts, I would think opening their contact information would be a good default, which would be consistent with using the same behavior as clicking their avatars in the conversation view.

		I received an SMS from my boss earlier (he's an iPhone user, using the default iOS SMS client) and, for some reason, TextSecure opened from the notification but crashed afterwards, hanging on a black screen after entering my passphrase and prompting Android to ask me if I wanted to Report/Wait/Close. I hit the app switcher button and dismissed TextSecure and tried the notification again but just got the black screen, so told Android to report the crash. I dismissed TextSecure via the app switcher again and opened TextSecure from the app shortcut and it let me in ok, but the text message now reads, in italics: Received a message encrypted using an old version of TextSecure that is no longer supported. Please ask the sender to upgrade to the most recent version and resend the message. except, as I mentioned, my boss isn't using TextSecure; he's using the default iOS SMS client. After whining about it on Twitter, @WhisperSystems replied asking me to open an issue with a debug log. So here I am, with a debug log at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9111ffde3f88317b203b 😎

		Hi everyone, after a good time using TextSecure I am starting to experience a really crippling bug that has many different outcomes: I am missing a certain number of messages (were sent to me but never received); Those I do receive are hardly ever pushed with a notification. I have to open TextSecure for them to show up, and they appear to have been sent right that minute; Tens of messages mark &quot;Now&quot; as the time they were sent/received. This is of course wrong, and fucks up the entire chronology (latest received on top); Whenever I try to send a text, it says TextSecure is trying to send a large quantity of messages; A fair amount of messages give me an &quot;unable to send&quot; error message. Any idea what the problem could be? Here's the debug log: https://gist.github.com/90779d7e4406141e3efe Thanks, Régis

		Hello, I think it would be really nice if a textsecure message has not been received it auto-retries using the unsecured SMS (ofcourse, only optional, disabled by defalt). This is useful in many situations like roaming or even when you want to save battery and disable push or mobile networking completely (and someone else tries to reach you). So what I propose is to add an option to notify the user when his textsecure message has not been recieved for X minutes and/or add an option to automatically send the same text via SMS to make sure it reaches the other one – ditching the security for a moment when other things are more important. For &quot;normal&quot; textsecure users this can be a rather frequent annoyance. EDIT: If possible, maybe one should delete the secured TextSecure message if the auto-falback SMS has been sent to avoid double-sending

		I received an SMS from Google Calendar's SMS notification short-code (48368) that TextSecure believes was encrypted with an out of date version of TextSecure. I do not believe that Google uses TextSecure's encryption (correct me if I'm wrong), thus I'm lead to believe that TextSecure is incorrect in it's evaluation that the message was encrypted. I am unable to retrieve the original (&quot;encrypted&quot;) text. TextSecure simply displays the &quot;error&quot; text: Received a message encrypted using an old version of TextSecure that is no longer supported. Please as the sender to upgrade to the most recent version and resend the message. Sent May 15th, 2015 02:10:02 PM EDT. I believe I was up-to-date at that time. My current version of TextSecure is 2.14.5 on Android 5.1. I have since received another message from 48368 which was not evaluated as encrypted and displayed as a normal unencrypted SMS. Is there any further information I can provide to help debug the issue? Is there anyway to get the original (&quot;raw&quot;) SMS message from under that error?

		Just installed branch 2.16.0 over 2.14.1. opened conversation opend emoji pane category recent was shown and it was completely empty furthermore, the recent category is always opened when changing the convo, rather than showing the last used category. Yes, you can argue that it's a personal favor that way - but at least don't show recents, when there are none 🙈

		For some reasons, textsecure on my phone seems to send 16bit encoded SMS. So I can only have 70 characters per SMS instead of 140 in 8bit or 160 in 7bit. Is the character encoding choosed by TextSecure or is it enforced by android system? I suspect 16bit encoding is mandatory for emoji, but in the case if I don't use them, could TextSecure switch to 8bit, or 7bit if I don't even use accents? This could cut by two my SMS budget.

		As far as I know, there's no great way for a list adapter to notify each list item that it needs to be recycled in the event that the activity is being paused/stopped/destroyed. Because of this, there's context leak around our Recipient listener logic. Seems like we should either 1) find a consistent way for RecyclerView/ListView adapters to listen to lifecycle events and report them up to their bound list items, or 2) make all our RecipientListeners only hold a weak reference to the context.

		It has happened sometimes (twice, so far) that even though I'm typing a message in the text box I don't get the arrow icon to send -- the attachment icon never goes away. When I click it, the behaviour is that of adding the attachment (so it's not just a problem of displaying the wrong icon, I am actually asked if I want to take a picture and stuff..). Exiting and re-entering the conversation fixes it. It has happened both when talking to a Signal user and with an SMS one. It seems to be random, I'm trying to figure out how it works but I can't reproduce :/

		I have weird problems with one of my friends. It just won't encrypt my messages anymore even though it worked before (like a couple of weeks before). She says however that the messages are shown in blue to her. But for me they are green and the lock is open. The info says that I am using insecure messages. I tried disabling and reenabling secure messages but that didn't fix the problem. I have TextSecure 2.14.5 and my friend says that she has the latest version also. She tried reinstalling the app but it didn't fix the problem. She says that it still works fine for her other friends. I have no problems with all my other friends.

		Many texting apps provide users with the ability to lock messages so that they cannot be deleted. It would be very useful to see this functionality come to the app, because after I imported all of my messages I began to clean them out and noticed that my locked messages were being deleted as well!

		Pictures I send are not displayed by my contact. On my end they are uploaded (dark blue background) and even delivered to their phone (check mark icon), they do not show up on their screen. The same happens in the opposite direction: they claim to have sent me a picture, and say it was sent and delivered, but I did not receive a message, and neither is any image displayed in the thread. Their installation/registration of TS is very new - only about an hour old. We are connected via a very low bandwidth and high latency network. https://gist.github.com/1651dc1d34c9b1a39572

		A friend of mine signed up for whisperpush on CM12 and was able to send me encrypted messages. While I managed to send them one encrypted message back ... textsecure running on stock android 5.1.1 does not want to send them encrypted messages.

		Hello, I'm not able to export my key anymore since you removed the encrypted backup. My friends are really annoyed by this. I'm flashing a lot of Custom Roms and every few weeks my key is gone and every of my 20+ contacts has to verify again that this is me and no MITM attack. Could you please add the export of the key again?

		Go to some conversation and tap the input box Type a BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN (U+1F4B5) with TS emoji drawer Type the same emoji with Lollipop system emoji keyboard Notice that the system dollar is bigger This gets fixed if you the leave conversation (draft gets saved) and then return back to the conversation. Also pasting stuff seems to affect it. This is only an issue with the input box. Sent and received messages show emojis at one size. Related: #2937 TS 2.16.2, Nexus 4, stock Android 5.1.1

		When I look at my sms/TS message info for received messages they always have the received time before the sent time. So received time could be 8:01:25 and sent time would be 8:01:30, for example. This is with users of any network and timezone as far as I can tell. Did they happen to get switched accidentally in the code? The difference in time is just a few seconds which would look right to me. Running 2.16.3 on galaxy s4 stock Verizon 5.0.1.

		Since a few days I experience a strange behaviour of TextSecure 2.14.5 on my OnePlus One with Android 5.0. I'm chatting with someone and the messages I send definitely get delivered: I see the checkmark under the message and my dialog partner reacts/answers on what I have written. Then, after some time (half a minute to several minutes) the checkmark disappears, I see a red exclamation mark left of the message and below it reads Nicht zugestellt (German for Not delivered). When I open the message details it offers to re-send the message, but this only removed the error message and does not bring back the checkmark. Do you have any idea what's going wrong here?

		Hi. I think it's time for TextSecure to join the 21st century by adding one of the most basic features in existence: A blocklist. If some moron starts sending me push messages, or text messages, I should be able to block the person. I don't really care how, if there is a list I have to add people to or if I press their name in the Text list and choose block, but the matter of fact is that this feature is waaaaaaaaay overdue.

I guess this feature might help in group chats or maybe it was added after noticing it in telegram. But I would love a toggle for this new feature because its making the dark theme look very ugly and functionally it isn't helpful at all. I guess this is super low priority but do consider adding an option to turn this UI design off.

		Hello, using TextSecure 2.16.4 on an LG G2 running latest stock ROM (Android 5.0.2 Lollipop), the Emojis are full of jaggies / have a low resolution. It becomes especially noticeable in the Emoji drawer when the system font size is set to a large value, which in turn lets the Emojis become bigger in the Emoji drawer. Here is a screenshot with system font size set to maximum: As you can see, the Emojis show a lot of jaggies and seem to have a low resolution. This can't be an issue with the Google &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot; Emoji set itself, since it is even available in SVG format from source, see: https://code.google.com/p/noto/source/browse/?name=master#git%2Fcolor_emoji%2Fsvg So, could you please fix that? Regards

		Hi. Bear with me here. This could be a problem with Cyanogen, or may be more appropriate for the support form. Feel free to close if either of these are the case. Android 4.2.2/Samsung SGH-T399/TextSecure 2.16.4 Debug log: https://gist.github.com/35c5e8f3086090a31234 I've mysteriously been registered to Cyanogen's whisperpush server for awhile now (I've never installed cyanogenmod on my device), and finally got around to unregistering myself. Previously, while I was registered, my friend who uses cyanogenmod tried to send me multiple encrypted messages, which would silently fail. After unregistering from Cyanogen's servers today, I downloaded TextSecure, and successfully registered with my phone number. However, when my friend with cyanogenmod and I tried sending encrypted messages to each other, we received &quot;bad encrypted message&quot; for each message we sent. He tried disabling encryption on his end (in which case i could only send him sms messages) and re-enabling it, but we still got &quot;bad encrypted message&quot; errors. Maybe some sort of problem with key exchanges failing when I was registered to cyanogen servers?

		MessageNotifier uses MediaPlayer for playing the notification sound for in thread notifications but never calls MediaPlayer.release() as strongly suggested in the MediaPlayer documentation the code should either be updated to call release() in a final block or, my preference, stop interacting with the MediaPlayer directly and let the Ringtone class handle this like so: Ringtone tone = RingtoneManager.getRingtone(context, uri);
tone.setStreamType(AudioManager.STREAM_NOTIFICATION);
tone.play(); Ringtone manages a MediaPlayer instance internally and takes care of release() and all that stuff.

			<description>
		Those who have used Google's &quot;Messenger&quot; application for Android in its more recent iterations may have noticed a new feature for attachments. Clicking the &quot;paperclip&quot; for Attachments , besides the usual options to attach a file, gives the user the option a number of &quot;Quick, in-app, in-line&quot; media capture options. For instance, choosing Picture (or alternately, Video) allows the user to capture the picture or video right from Messenger (a camera window is opened below the text entry box ) which is then added to the message to form the outgoing MMS. Likewise, if the user chooses the Audio tab there is a &quot;Microphone button&quot; and instructions to &quot;press and hold to record&quot;. Doing so allows the user to speak a message which is then encoded as an audio file and added to the outgoing MMS. From what I can tell, TextSecure lacks these options. While a user can send a picture, video, or audio file that has already been saved elsewhere, I believe it would benefit TextSecure to enable these &quot;Quick Capture&quot; options, both for traditional SMS/MMS and Secure(Data) messaging. Many users find these options alluring (particularly the audio quick capture, which allows the sending of a short audio message that can be played by the recipient at their leisure) and TextSecure supporting these features would mean users who enjoy them currently on other platforms could switch and enjoy better privacy/security without having to lose said features Please let me know if this seems feasible. Thank you.

		Over the past week I've experienced a very strange failure mode. Me and person P were exhanging unsecured text messages. I was using TextSecure (push registered), while P was using a stock messaging app. At some point, TextSecure on my phone started thinking that P was registered with TextSecure, and switched to sending encrypted messages. I sent a few encrypted messages to P, which P never received. Upon learning that P wasn't receiving my messages, I tried ending the secure session with P on my phone. This had no effect: TextSecure still insisted on sending encrypted messages. I tried de-registering my phone and then registering it again, but that didn't help. Ultimately the only way to reach P was to de-register my phone and keep push disabled :( The most pressing issue is: Why did TextSecure think P was registered? P never installed TextSecure or Signal, and did not change their phone number, or anything like that. The secondary issue is: Why did TextSecure not allow me to send plain SMS, even after I selected &quot;end secure session&quot;? I looked at the log, and the only potentially relevant line I could find was this: W/Directory(22806): Adding active token: +*********xx, 47+CqoNE/Fv5gw (where xx is the last 2 digits of P's phone number, so I know the line corresponds to their account.) (PS. Is the debug log designed to be safe for posting in public, or is there a document describing which fields should be censored?) Version info for my device: Device  : LGE Nexus 4 (occam)

It just happened to me that I exceeded that limit (without noticing) and sent a message that was automatically trimmed while being sent. Please notify the user that the message will be trimmed, or prevent the typing in the first place. Don't know in which version this problem arose

		If I look at my TextSecure contact list or directly in a contact conversation, there is no way to know if a contact has been verified or not. In case I'm not sure I can only verify the contact again to be 100% sure. It would be nice to have an indication of verified contact. I.e. it could be an orange dot for unverified and green dot for verified, or the lock in the conversation view could change is color when it's verified. Or at least on the &quot;Verify identity&quot; screen you should write: &quot;Successfully verified&quot;, Verified&quot; or &quot;Verified on + date/time&quot;, I don't know what is more suitable but I'm sure it would be a very useful and important feature to help people use the app in the best possible way.

		When looking over at other apps for translation hints, I found Facebook messenger's way of handling the new feature : The time options make more sense IMO, and as you can see &quot;Mute&quot; has no literal translation in French and needs at least 3 words. Replacing &quot;Mute for 1 hour&quot; with &quot;For 1 hour&quot; helps a lot and &quot;Mute&quot; is already mentioned in the title.

		I have a bad feeling I am not going to get a friendly response to this. :) My device (samsung gt-p5113) has TextSecure 2.5.3, which works fine. I recently was looking through the Play Store, and noticed that TextSecure was not listed among my apps. I searched for it, and when I found it, the app page said &quot;this version is not compatible with your device.&quot; I checked with some other people, and they had versions up to 2.17.0! Can someone explain why newer versions are &quot;not compatible,&quot; and (I hope) change something so that I am able to install newer versions, and keep up with development. Thanks.

		It is clear that uninstalling/reinstalling is a big problem for group chats. Receiving a message from a group makes it impossible to answer or open the keyboard or update the group. An idea to fix this could be this. You could add an &quot;restore/ask to rejoin&quot; option (available only when you detect that the user can't reply), which asks all the people who have written so far for the metadata of the group chat. This would be the least painful way for newbies to get around the current problem which requires an avatar update. Do you think this is feasible?

		(Creating new story from thread in #970) I'm seeing an alert that I have two new messages whenever TS is locked. Upon unlocking no message is received, and the alert disappears, but when TS is re-locked I once again get an alert for two &quot;Encrypted Message&quot;. (There are two messages from this contact that were sent to me but which I have still never received. This problem began immediately after these were sent.) I've uploaded a capture from logcat -v long while locking and unlocking to reproduce this. This problem has been ongoing for a week now. Re-initiating secure session does not help, restarting the phone does not help. Currently using the latest Play Store version: 2.18.2.

		My problem is that I have several contacts that tried TextSecure but uninstalled it after a short time without unregistering. Unfortunately they're also unwilling to use the unregister function on the Website and so I'm stuck with several phone numbers still shown as TextSecure Contacts and whenever I try to send a Message it automatically uses the push service instead of the normal SMS system. It would be helpful if there was a possibility to permanently deactivate push messages for certain contacts or even better, to automatically unregister contacts that have uninstalled the app.

I slept like a rock last night, so I figured I should include a picture showing what I'm talking about in case that isn't clear. Also, next time I find something like this, should I write here or in the mail list? I already posted it in the Google+ Community Beta group, but I figured no one ever goes there. Really offtopic question, but is there any point in fixing the RedPhone translations? The program hasn't been updated for quite some time, and I'm not a collaborator in the Swedish translation so I can't actually edit the reviewed strings.

		I've been using Textsecure for more than a year without a password. Today I decided I wanted to work with one. I used my SIM's PIN as the password (that's four digits). Now I can't enter the app. It says my password is invalid. I know the consequence is that I've lost all my messages. Not a drama but very annoying indeed. I've warned all of my friends using Textsecure to not use a password. It's simply not possible that I typed my PIN incorrectly when creating the password. I type it everyday many times and Textsecure asked me to repeat it before accepting it as the password, so something's definitely wrong with Textsecure regarding passwords.

And the incoming bubbles for messages I receive are a bit too narrow. Half the space of the screen is being wasted :/ Could you reduce the right margin?

		I've tried over and over and cannot register my phone for TextSecure. I live in a remote rural area and cannot get decent phone reception at the same time that I have a wifi connection. If I drive to a spot to receive the SMS then I lose the wifi connection. If I try to do Voice Verify then it says no network - presumably meaning no wifi connection. So it's impossible to register here. I almost got it once by driving out to get reception but the short time limit of 2 minutes cut off before the SMS that came in moments later. I don't understand why you have to make it so difficult to register the phone, or even why a secure messaging app needs to have my phone number registered in the first place. Is this some hidden tracking agenda - why need the phone number for text messaging. But my real point here is to let you know that registration is broken for people like me in rural areas. It seems the only way for me to do this is to wait for some day when I'm at some cafe with free wifi and decent phone reception both together. Can this not be made less onerous?

I had a conversation with a non-ts user on iPhone (non-signal) and I also had a group conversation with that same user + a TS user on android. When I would send messages to the single-user conversation, said user would get duplicates of every message. I tried rebooting my phone, etc, to no avail. Once I deleted the mixed-group (TS/non-TS) the problem stopped. I accidentally submitted the log w/o grabbing the link for the log to post here. If this isn't enough info, feel free to nuke this, just thought we should have a record of it.

		My phone just updated from 2.20 to 2.21 (Moto G on 4.4.4). I think the new colors are not nearly as pretty or as useful as the 2.20 colors were. 2.20 was beautiful and extremely functional!!! You had it right! :-) The two major issues I find with the new colors are... Insufficient Variability: Before you had a nice wide array of colors for the recipient names. It was great because I didn't have to read, I knew which text was which user with a simple glance at the colors. Now most things are dark green/gray/blue and that information is lost, I'm back to reading the names to find the thread I want. Dark/Intense: The new colors are quite dark and quite intense. It almost looks like they're all some sort of warning messages. The last colors were calm and reassuring. Awesome work overall! Textsecure has come so far from where it was a year ago!

		The double ticks that were introduced in version 2.21.0 as status indicators are not intuitive. I guess they mean: one tick for &quot;message delivered to server&quot; two ticks for &quot;message delivered to chat partner(s)&quot; but these icons have nothing to do with the status. Even the former design (light blue until delivered to server and tick once it was delivered) was way more clear than now. What will happen if one day tha status for &quot;message read&quot; will be added. Three ticks? My suggestion: Look at Threema's status icons (grey envelope --&gt; dark envelope --&gt; mailbox --&gt; eye). I think this is one of these example where design killed usability.

		Hi, using 2.21.0 on Android 4.4.4 Since the update to 2.21.0 all my contacts have different colors. Apart from the ugly brown color for my girlfriend, I can't differ between a secure message and SMS now. Which was very easy in past (green/blue). Except for the small lock-icon in the message, which is really small. How about a possibility the change the contact-color? And make the difference between secure and not-secure more noticeable? Thx!

		Hi! I am am wondering why there is yet not an update on the still missing group SMS feature in Textsecure.The original issue concerning this question, issue #413, has already been opend in 2013 and now, in mid 2015, there is still no information, when the feature will be implemented. For 1 1/2 years this feature has been wished by a lot of people, as the lively discussion in #413 shows. But now, the conversation #413 has been locked and limited to collaborators ca. a month ago and you cannot participate in the discussion in #413 anymore. Why this limitation of the discussion? Can you provide us, please, with any concrete information, when the missing group SMS feaure will be implemented? Thanks! @moxie0 : I did not want to open a duplicate, but as it is technically impossible to write in #413 which is in general about the missing feature and not about technical details. I saw no other way. Sorry, if the new issue caused trouble. However,my question was not about a regular update service, but was only caused, as this group SMS feature request is open since quite a long time and I was wondering if it is still planned or not. Thanks again.

		Hi, since the introduction of the new colors, the dark theme has become brighter. It's good on one hand, but it's slightly annoying on the other. I think the background in conversations should be darker (maybe pure black? I think it used to be darker). This way it would be less similar to the color of sent bubbles and the general look would be less bright. Does that make sense?

			<description>
		Hello, the incoming message bubbles in TextSecure 2.21.0 have a colored background (color depends on setting per contact) and the text inside those incoming message bubbles is white. So far that is fine. But: The lock symbol and the date in those incoming message bubbles basically have the same color as the bubble's background, which results in a very low contrast and bad readability. In comparison: The outgoing message bubbles in TextSecure 2.21.0 have a white background and the text inside those outgoing message bubbles is black/dark gray. And the lock symbol and the date in those outgoing message bubbles have the same (or similar) contrasting color as the message text (black/dark gray), which results in a much better readability. So: Could you please change the lock symbol and the date in the incoming message bubbles to a white color? With white they would have a much better contrast to the colored background and would have a much better readability. PS: The phone number in the conversation toolbar (the phone number that is being displayed below the chat partner's name) has the same issue. So it would be nice if you would change that to a white color as well. Regards

		Hello, with TextSecure 2.21.0 you can change the color for each contact. When changing the color, the color for the conversation toolbar changes as well. So it's a bit like changing the theme color. However, the attachment button inside the conversation remains blue (default theme color) for example. It would be really nice if you could add an option to TextSecure which would allow to change not just the color for each contact, but also change the theme color globally, so that the color is changed everywhere, including the main screen and settings and so on. Or with other words: Currently the default color in the TextSecure &quot;Light&quot; theme is blue. I'd like to have an option to change this default color to something else. Any chance you could do that? It could be placed under Settings -&gt; Appearance. It would be much appreciated. Regards

		It would be great if one could hide the emoji button and/or replace it with something more useful (e.g. attachment button). There are various reasons why one might not need the emoji button: The keyboard used might already provide an emoji button (as in my case). One might prefer to use/type old-fashioned ASCII emojis, therefore not needing the advanced emoji menu provided by TextSecure. One might not want to use emojis at all. and probably some more that I can't think of...

		Some want uniformity and emoji can get lost in translation but this is not a TextSecure problem and shouldn't be fixed here. Even if it were to be fixed here, why settle on the Apple ones? I can't see how many people have installed Signal but there are 253 ratings, compared to 19,627 ratings for TextSecure. Would iOS users like Android emoji? Probably not. Most people likely prefer whatever they're used to, so it's better to let the system handle the look instead of forcing everyone to use the Apple ones which look really cheap and doesn't fit in at all on Android. TextSecure uses one set of emoji while the rest of the system and other apps uses another now. Also notifications still use the system emoji and apparently nothing can be done about this. The inconsistencies look really sloppy. Adding options is usually not a good idea but the same goes for changing the look that people are used to, so if anything there should be a &quot;compatibility mode&quot; where those who want to make sure nothing gets lost in translation can switch to Apple emoji.

		When attaching a picture to a text and sending, the sending icon/circle remains on the picture and spins endlessly without disappearing. Recipients sometimes do receive the picture, but the sending icon never stops spinning and wears the battery down unless it is forced to quit. It seems to work a little better with other textsecure users, but not at all with non-textsecure users.

		First off, the gist of the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b4bd3001d8c0525e81c9 I've used TextSecure for a long while, but I only very recently picked up my first contact who also uses it. I was so excited when I sent my first message! I was slightly less excited when she said that all she received was a &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; error. I did some debugging on my end, which led to a debug log that looked something like the one that I posted above (but without the crash). This morning however, her &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; to me also resulted in TextSecure crashing upon receiving the message. I don't know why today's message exchange led to a crash but the previous ones didn't. I'm also confused as to why I'm trying to JSON decode an HTML error message. Any ideas as to what could be going on and/or suggestions on what to try next?

		Starting off with the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/76b13998ebfb86b7142c As we discussed in #3642, I had previously used Titanium Backup, which I had learned after doing so is frowned upon. So I went with the nuclear option of nuking my TextSecure install (wiped data, reinstalled too just for good measure), and starting fresh. The above debug log is after nuking everything. I have a bit more details about what's going on this time, too. First, and probably most importantly, is that the person on the other side of this issue is running WhisperPush version 5.0.2-30bd462d41 on a OnePlus running CM (which is the stock OS on the device). My encrypted push messages to them are good, but I just receive the &quot;Bad encrypted message&quot; error. They can exchange messages with other WhisperPush users, but I'm currently not sure about other TextSecure users. Normal SMS works, but that's probably not shocking. Normal MMS also works. Thoughts/suggestions?

		...leading to an inconsistent user experience on their devices. Possible solution: In order to enable a more unified experience accross different devices and platforms, Textsecure could use the same Emoji set as the default setting for the app, but allow the user to fall back to the device's system Emoji set if the user prefers a more consistent experience on their device.

		Some users really, really don't like the Apple emoji, and won't use TextSecure any more because of that. I know, it sounds really petty. However, I have (or rather, had) five contacts using TextSecure (4 Android, 1 iphone), and since the release to the Play Store of version 2.22.2, two of the Android contacts have stopped using it and gone back to unencrypted SMS because of the Apple emoji. I've seen the contributing guide: &quot;[t]he answer is not more options&quot;. I'm not saying the right thing to do is add a user-visible preference. I don't know what the right action is. However, I've gone from having the majority of my texts encrypted to having virtually none of them encrypted, and the new emoji are what touched it off.

		I am having a similar problem to some of the other guys but mine seems to go a little further. My contacts don't seem to link with my messages, but also when I send an SMS with some of my contacts the phone will automatically send the message to other contacts too. I will then get replies from other people not knowing why I am texting them but very rarely will the intended recipient get the actual message. With one if my contacts I have given up texting him now and I have resorted to using whatsapp. This is very very confusing for me and I must admit I have no idea why its happening. Furthermore I feel very unable to fix it. Can anyone help me??

		When there's an option in your used keyboard to open an emoji drawer (see pic3), then it uses the default system Emojis (Android - see pic1).

		Hi, When I write a message in landscape orientation, the keyboard does not show its text prediction suggestions. Even worse, the keyboard automatically corrects words it does not know, without giving me the possibility to chose or add them to the dictionary. This only occurs when writing a message in landscape mode. In portrait mode, the keyboard works like it is supposed to be. Also in other apps, writing in landscape mode shows the prediction suggestions. System: HTC Desire, cyanogenmod 7.2.0.1-bravo, textsecure: 2.21.0, stock keyboard (german) Attached some screenshots: 01: textsecure app in landscape mode (predictions are missing) 02: textsecure app in portrait mode (predictions are shown) 02: note taking app in landscape mode (predictions are shown) Please let me know if you need any further information. And after all: Thanks for providing textsecure!

		Hi, Just started using TextSecure. I have a few requests / suggestions but for starters could we have more choice of theme colours? For example I'd like to have a white background for the main window with the title bar and new message 'bubble' in black. So, I guess a full palette of colours would be best that can be chosen with a white or black background, with the option to have contact 'bubbles' match the chosen theme colour. Thanks

The copy icon goes away when you select multiple messages, leaves you with only the ability to delete. I realize there's some difficulty with how to perform the actual copying.

		Hi, I am a big fan of TextSecure and just discovered the new version (2.32.2) in the Google Play store. Unfortunately, the app is requesting a lot of new permissions. The stated reason is so you can integrate RedPhone later on, which makes sense to make TextSecure more like Signal. While I don't want to imply that I think you guys are doing anything fishy with my data, you will surely understand that people might not install a secure messaging app that has just about access to anything. For example, I cannot see how access to my Calendar is important to exchange messages nor to make phone calls. I think it would really serve you and the community well if you would put an explanation of all the permissions in a prominent place on the open whisper systems website. Having this information easily accessible (link from Google store to that site?) will help users to build trust. Of course anyone can read the code to see that you are not up to anything, but that isn't a good enough answer here since not many people will have the time nor the technical expertise to do so. If your code is audited you could add information about audits on your website, stating who did the audit, with which version of the app and link to their results. Thanks!

		This is a show stopper for me. Message size restriction of 280kb means I couldn't send a video to my daughter. I could , however, send it with 'that other well known messaging app'. Are you intending to address this in some way?

		Not everyone wants to use all the features, but the standard install now asks for calendar, microphone (in RedPhone preparation), location, and other permissions. How about a second smaller TextSecure version that really is just a limited secure messenger? Should not even be able to take pictures. Even though it is Open Source and I could check things, most people cannot and hence less Android permissions would create more trust. Please consider two builds, one full featured and one with just messaging capabilities. You might even kill SMS support and make it even less requiring. Thanks.

		I found it very useful to be able to identify which users are signal/textsecure users. e.g. I know person_A is traveling to country_X and should not be contacted over SMS, before the contact list revamp I could very easily see whether a message to them would be via sms or TextSecure. Following the revamp I have to. go to contacts select contact start typing something to see if I get TS or SMS send (because &quot;attach&quot; is the default option on a new message) Request Can we can some sort of visual indication of whether a contact is a TextSecure user in the contact list?

		Hello everybody, I really like this app but my contact list has only a very limited number of Textsecure users. Why isn't it possible to add contacts of which I don't have stored the phone number, just other identifiers like an e-mail-adress or a second phone number for example, like it is possible in Threema?

		Before every group message the sender's name is displayed in a separate screen row. It would save space when the name would be displayed e.g. within the message bubble before or after the time. Alternatively/additionally, displaying names in group conversations might be a setting (ideally on a per-group basis), since there may be no need for names when avatars are distinctible.

		Tried to share a contact in my address book today via TextSecure which I couldn't do as, although TextSecure is set as the default text messaging app, it doesn't appear on the 'Send To' menu when using 'Share' in the Address Book. The stock Android messaging app is there which of course I couldn't use as it's not the default. I did try searching for this as an issue here so hopefully it's not a dupe.

		Contacts without assigned images in the default Google contacts app (also used in the default phone dialer) are assigned a color which normally cannot be changed. Recently however, I've noticed that contacts of the people who are TextSecure registered users do change. The color changes are seemingly random (one was grey, then light blue, red, orange, now purple), and I have yet to find a pattern as when they happen (once it occurred right after I switched back to the contact screen from TextSecure; sometimes I only notice when I open the phone dialer). When it happens all of the contacts of TextSecure users change at once. I'm not exactly sure what causes the problem, but I'm pretty sure it is an issue with TextSecure since all my contacts' colors stay the same except for those who also use TextSecure (even one whom I've never actually texted). Note that this does not apply to the colors that you can assign people within TextSecure; those remain the same. Changing them within TextSecure is probably not the impetus for a change in contacts either, since one that I've never changed within TextSecure has changed in Google contacts. I wonder if it has something to do with the new searching contacts screen in TextSecure? I feel it happens more often after I go to that screen, but that's just a guess. I'm using TextSecure 2.23.2 on a Nexus 5 running Android 5.1.1. Here is a log, if that helps: https://gist.github.com/e5166ff4b9b0ea4b55e0

 From the code there it seems the session files in the /data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms/files/sessions-v2 dir should have already been migrated to version 3, which was not the case for me. The files in this location were mostly version 2 and even some version 1 on my phone... After I deleted these session files I was able to start the app again. But sending a secure message afterward resulted in it directly crashing again. And now again, it crashes on start, when trying to resend the pending message.

		Go to a conversation with Eva (a contact with a short name) Receive a message from Reinhold (a contact with a longer name) Tap the notification to open the conversation with Reinhold Notice that Reinhold's name is truncated as R... TextSecure seems to use the length of the contact name in the previous conversation (the length of Eva's name) as the basis to ellipsize the contact name in the conversation that was opened through a notification (Reinhold). TS 2.23.3, Nexus 4, stock 5.1.1 I guess this is somewhat related to the latter part of #3718.

		After opening TextSecure from a new message notification (via notification bar), it is not possible to switch ConversationActivity into landscape mode by rotating the phone. The orientation simply doesn't change. This is not reproducible by opening TS normally via launcher icon. In this case everything is fine. I'm using an HTC One S with Cyanogenmod 11 M12. The problem exists approximately since v2.22. I can't remember the exact release, sorry. Let me know if more information is needed.

		In TextSecure, if I want to send the same message to multiple persons I can create a group first and send the message to the group. However then everyone in the group becomes aware that it is a group message -- in other words groups are always global. It would be nice to either send to multiple recipients without the need for creation of groups (I think this has already been requested) or allow the creation of groups which are local, so that we can send the same message to multiple people without the recipients being aware of the fact.

		Hi! Debug log is at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cf13994aa7ab1343066a and hopefully isn't terribly embarrassing. I sent a friend a single message and got one of the JSON errors in the log. Being stubborn, I tried many more times and got many more errors. Disabling TextSecure servers for messages (forcing the SMS fallback, right?) causes the message to go through, no crash, no problem. I just updated TS to 2.23.3 and my Android version is 5.0.x on a Nexus 5. Not super-confident of the actual Android version as it was an OEM-provided phone, not purchased through my service provider. Hope this helps!

		https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/crypto/MasterCipher.java#L65 As it turns out, over the course of loading the items in the conversation list view, Cipher.getInstance is called 32 times from its various initializations and takes ~100ms of main thread time per dataset change, which means ~300-500ms of main thread time per message sent since the cursor is reloaded up to 5 times when a message is sent. Seems like we should either have one MasterCipher instance that we pass along to the various Mms/SmsDatabase readers or at least have the Cipher instances be static singletons.

		I'm on the translate team for TextSecure and SMSSecure for the Dutch language, and I noticed in both projects some inconsistencies. In Dutch, you have 2 forms for the English &quot;you&quot; (ignoring the &quot;thou&quot; form here): the informal &quot;jij&quot;, and the more formal &quot;u&quot;. I noticed both forms are used in translations, probably depending on the personal preference of the translator of the specific string. In French you have &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot;, in German &quot;du&quot; and &quot;sie&quot;, but I didn't check the French and German translations to see if the forms are mixed there too. I don't know any other languages well enough to say if it can be an issue there. In current Dutch both forms are socially acceptable (although some mostly elder people frown on the use of the informal form). I would suggest the app choose one of the forms to be more consistent. Having both forms mixed makes a sometimes strange impression. I have no strong personal preference for either form. What is the opinion of the developers?

		If you expand the notification drawer, there are 9 lines (in my case) of message text shown. There is no indication for how many messages were received or if there is more text. If you received more than 9 lines (wrapped single message, multi line single message, multiple messages) then there should be ellipsis in the ninth line, like it is done for the multiple thread notification. And as of the current sort order this gets even more confusing. You see the most recent message in the collapsed notification and it is not shown (or indicated to be anywhere) when you expand the notification (when there 9+ lines of notification) Can screenshoot if my description is too confuse 😉 Edit: ... and totally forgot to demand a message count indicator

		This is TextSecure 2.23.3 running on and LG L40 with the default LG Android 4.4.2 (Build number KOT49I.A1399985852, Software version V10d-EUR-XX). In one of my group chats the keyboard is not showing when I try to focus the text input. It works as expected in &quot;singe user chats&quot; and the only other group chat I'm part of. The broken group chat looks like this: When I hit the text field labelled &quot;Send TextSecure message&quot; nothing happens. I suspect that the group chat is in some strange state as the group is named &quot;Unnamed group&quot; and I can't see any other group members from the menu: Navigating to &quot;Conversation settings&quot; I get the following screen: Also, I can add for example a picture but can't hit the send button, i.e., the send button doesn't do anything when I hit it. As far as I recall I have reinstalled my phone (and thereby TextSecure) since the group chat was created.

		In different preferences sliders (switchcompat?) are used. In the light theme, they are the TS blue which looks great, while in the dark theme they are aqua. While this is certainly not a show-stopper, it would look nicer if they matched the same blue or a more muted blue than having them be aqua. For someone who knows Android dev, unlike myself, this is probably pretty easy.

 Basically, I wanted to check the current status of the TextSecure-Browser project. Since I'm lazy, rather than rebuilding the android application to use the staging server and create another account, I wanted to try to use it to contact my mother and I modified the javascript sources to not use the staging servers (I just removed the -staging string from the urls, as a wild guess) I thought: what's the worse that could happen? the messages might just fail to be delivered well, apparently I was wrong... maybe because the browser plugin expects a newer version of the app, but now I always get the above exception. The problem still happens even after removing/disabling the extension on my browser. The exception doesn't happen if I put the phone in airplane mode, but otherwise it keeps crashing (and showing the related popup) I tried to find a way to disassociate my browser from the phone, but apparently there's no such option. Rebooting the phone didn't help. I frankly could do without TextSecure for a few days... I'd switch back to the normal sms app until this issue would be fixed. But afaik, the only way I could do that, is by uninstalling textsecure/removing the account. Unfortunately this would then create a new key and I'd need to notify my new contacts of the changed fingerprint. I'd like if there was a day to do one of the following things: Tell textsecure to stop connecting altogether Tell textsecure to disable automatic restart Export my textsecure's private key (ok, this is less than ideal, but I'm already suffering from a self-inflicted DOS :P ) Also, I understand that an Android application's lifecycle is not as simple as a normal Java app, so it might not be that easy. But is there no way to have a top-level catch-all exception that recognizes such an issue, increments a counter to detect if the failure was a one-off or is cronical, and does something sane (temporarily disabling itself... don't let the exception bubble up to the system, etc.)? Thank you

		When I receive a notification of a new message in landscape mode and tap on it, it takes me into the thread I have with that contact but the contact's name is in a smaller font than normal. If I use the top left arrow button to go to the list of threads, then go back into that contact it is back to normal. This does not occur if I receive the notification and tap it in portrait mode.

		Hey, could be that this is my fault but I didn't change anything, just made git pull and wanted to build the new version. Now it always fails even when I try to build older versions. This is the output: &gt;./gradlew build

		With the current version 2.24.1, and also with the previous version, I noticed, that on my two different devices the repeating alarm (I set this to &quot;repeat two times&quot;) never stops. Because the support forum has no related entries, I regard this as a bug and report it here. First device: Android 4.0.3, second device: Android 4.0.4.

		I had to revert to using my backup handset and now I don't seem to be able to send sms messages to a friend who is also running TextSecure. I checked and normal SMS go through OK. Is this because I changed handsets and then changed back to my original one? When I try and send a message using TextSecure it fails to send. I've uploaded my debug log; https://gist.github.com/anonymous/50d59c24fa2fcf21c814

		I have a conversation with this friend of mine that recently has been causing a lot of problems. (This happened on 2.24 too, so it shouldn't be 2.25-related) So basically: I type a message Hit send Wait... Sometimes the message bubble appears, sometimes it crashes before it does I reopen ts, unlock it, go to the conversation and the message bubble is there. The message is also correctly marked as send and delivered debug log: https://gist.github.com/a3061a1f4b7edfcfdcab

		I am not sure if this is the way to reproduce it, but here is what I did Change private notifications settings so that TS only displays the name I chatted for a while, etc etc, everything works fine (by the way I think that &quot;Contents hidden&quot; should be in italics in the notification area) I switched back to the standard setting so that TS displays name and message Now TS doesn't ring anymore when I receive messages, unless it's a message from a contact that has a custom ringtone

			<description>
		The wording of several strings is inconsistent regarding the use of 'SD Card' and 'Storage', although all of these strings refer to the very same thing (as seen in the source code). I'd like to do a small PR correcting that, but want to gather information first what term is prefered. Some things to consider: As far as I know, TextSecure is not able to access a 'real' SD card when using KitKat or Lollipop. The term 'SD card' could be confusing to users with no SD card slot on their phone. The concept of a 'emulated SD card' could be even more confusing to those users ('There are no power users'). Possible terms: SD card storage device storage external storage (thx, @2-4601) anything else? I'd appreciate your input!

		After receiving a group message, TextSecure now crashes as soon as I open the app. I didn't see an issue that was similar, so here are the details: Device info: Blackphone BP1, Android 4.4.2, TextSecure 2.25.1 App state: Not push registered, used for incoming SMS/MMS Debug log: https://gist.github.com/red-coracle/58fd3e2d5e90c1e5168a Since I couldn't get into the app for a log, I used adb and copied what I thought was relevant. Let me know if you need more info. Thanks!

		I appear to be stuck on 2.22.2 of TextSecure. When I visit the Google Play page, it tells me &quot;Your device isn't compatible with this version&quot;. I can use the latest WhatsApp just fine, and this is the first time I've ever encountered this issue with an app so I don't think this is a permissions problem. Any ideas why the latest version would be incompatible? Do we need Android &gt; 4.1.2 to get the latest versions now?

I don't think she has tampered with the Custom Blink Pattern option, though.

		It should be possible to register a TextSecure account without giving Whisper Systems, or my contacts, my phone number. I think it's curious that an application with a strong focus on privacy requires the disclosure of this highly identifying piece of information - but I understand that this is caused by the origin of TextSecure as an SMS app. With that left behind, the road is now open to permit users to use another kind of identifier. A natural choice would be email addresses.

I also found some issue in ts. Like if you add any friends in group after that admin can not remove any friends from the group. Admin must remove any member from group. When some members post text message in group then notification shows that this friends post text message but does not show the group name, so we think that this is private message but actually its group message. Other issue is we only select one image at time, we must select 10 to 20 image at time. Sorry for my bad English but i tried to contribute to this awesome app. Thanks Bahadursinh

		By default when you send a message to an other TextSecure user it needs a data connection to be delivered. Sometimes I know the recipients to my messages (TextSecure users) are not in data range at their location. It is frustrating to think you can send a message to a non-user in that same location and he/she will get it (as it will be a SMS over the regular cellular network), whereas a user won't... Sometimes having the message reach its destination is more important than keeping the content private. I wish I could have an option to 'just once' send the message as regular SMS when texting other users.

So I wanted to know if it would be possible to implement some similar style in TextSecure as it offers all the &quot;features&quot; we have or we will have in the future (except stickers). It has the same quick capture layout, a gallery, (stickers), audio messages (push-to-talk style) and send location. Maybe some dev could take a look at it and tell us if this would be possible. I (personally) think the design is just great 😄

		On a Kyocera Rise C5155 running Android 4.0.4, in TextSecure 2.17.0, the icons for contacts take a long time to load, and often flicker from the contact's initial to the image saved for that contact while the list loads. This makes it hard to quickly scroll down the list of messages to find a conversation you want to add a message to (which is generally an easier way to find a contact in TextSecure than to search for a contact, I find on this device). Note the Rise is a piece of crap ;) and also one of the last slide-out keyboard phones out there, meaning there might be the mitigating factor of switching from portrait to landscape and the keyboard kicking in. This issue may have improved slightly with the latest release, but loading is still frustratingly slow.

		Please add an option to disable this nag. I am only wanting to use TextSecure as an sms client, I have no interest in encrypting my messages and if I do so, I cannot send or receive those messages because I usually have no data. This is not the first time this has been requested: WhisperSystems#1891 WhisperSystems#1966 WhisperSystems#2734 Unfortunately, these threads are all closed so I cannot add my request to them... the explanation appears to be that encrypted standard sms support is going away, but I don't understand how this is an explanation for this request, isnt non-encrypted standard sms still to be available? It appears that all those thread writers are not interested in encrypted sms, but rather just plain sms, as am I, and as far as I can tell, this issue has not been addressed yet for us. Again, my reasons for using textsecure is not encryption, but rather that it has some nice features as an sms application, and is not as vulnerable to the stagefright bug.

		As I don't use TextSecure for sending or receiving SMS messages, I would like to be able to completely disable this functionality. In this way I won't be allowed to send unencrypted messages using TextSecure, not even by error. Currently if I long press the send button, or if I specify a phone number that is not using TextSecure, I am allowed to send a plain text SMS. Especially in the latter case it is not immediate to realize that this is happening. I think that the average user expects to disable any kind of SMS operation when setting &quot;SMS and MMS&quot; to Off. Thanks!

		Currently, if someone gets the ability to get my SMSes, such as by stealing my SIM card or somehow intercepting them at the carrier, or number cloning, then the only thing standing in the way of that person impersonating me to a user I've already chatted to is the key mismatch warning. Some users will click through that without thinking. And someone who's never chatted to me before will not get any warning because of TOFU. Since I don't think there's any intention to aggressively push users to manually verify key fingerprints, it would be nice if I could add a passphrase to my registration that would not let someone register a new device with my phone number without also having that passphrase. Since this adds some friction, it would be reasonable for it to be opt-in; that is to say, once I register my number for the first time, I should be able to go into the settings and enable the passphrase requirement. The biggest drawback I can see is that if I give up my phone number and then it is reassigned, someone else will be stuck unable to use textsecure with that number. I can't really think of a perfect way to solve this, but expiring a registration that hasn't been used at all in some period of time, say 12 months, would probably be a reasonable approach. Alternatively, instead of just requiring use, the server could periodically send the client a liveness check of some sort (via push), and clear the registration if those don't succeed for some shorter period of time (3 months?) if the app isn't even responding at all.

		I have a Nexus 6 with stock android 5.1.1, the problem is always reproducible. The steps are: Take a photo with the phone camera; Go to the Photos app, open the image and &quot;share it to TextSecure&quot;; TextSecure opens. Chose a recipient. The image appears in the conversation; Press &quot;send&quot;. The message disappears, nothing is sent. Here is the debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/32aae2e2352b96d4bf40 The initial logged crash is probably not related to this, but to another issue that I'm going to report right after this.

		Well this is an interesting one. TS 2.25.3 on Android 2.3.4. I coaxed somebody into installing Signal and after some confusion about a verification code (I was getting texts that didn't tell me to send it to her, eventually we figured out that I should do that) she attempted to start a session with me. It failed. At that point, every other active textsecure session I have with every other contact is now completely broken. I get a &quot;failed to send&quot; both on regular messages and on attempts to end the secure session. The 'tap for details' UI just says &quot;failed to send&quot; in red, and the &quot;tap to resend&quot; button will fail again. With another TextSecure user in the same house, now he cannot send me messages (&quot;failed to send&quot;) or end a secure session with me. He also reports that it's asking him to verify my new identity key (?!). It appears to have persisted one reboot and I will try another.

			<description>
		Use case: I and my contact are &quot;push registered&quot;, but at various times one of us goes offline for a few hours and would like to seamlessly switch to SMS. Explanation: I only use data when connected to WiFi, so SMS is prefered communication channel much of the time. This is common amongst my contacts here in Europe, but some have mobile data. Issue: TS seems to switch to PUSH whenever sender has data (or even if previous conversation was PUSH). This leads to frustrating undelivered messages if sender simply hits reply without deliberately forcing SMS. Feature request: When there is evidence that the sender or recipient is offline, there should be some way to prefer SMS. Two possible ways to avoid these undelivered PUSH replies: Seamless SMS fallback if either person is not online. If &quot;seamless&quot; is not an option: receiving an SMS should trigger SMS mode for the conversation. I understand that defaulting to SMS is problematic now that SMS encryption is gone, but this could be an &quot;Advanced&quot; option for nerds like me. Can add a warning as modal, or in settings: &quot;Warning: this could cost you money or accidentally lead to insecure SMS communication.&quot; Related: This behavior was outlined by @cramu here: WhisperSystems#984 (comment) If sender or recipient are not reachable (because mobile data is not available) a popup appears, warning the sender that the message could be delayed and asking him for confirmation or to edit his message and send via SMS/MMS. Issue #678 looked promising, but that bug is huge, stale and it is unclear what was finally decided upon / implemented.

		Hi, i would love to see an App in an App functionality: So that third-parties can develop own apps that need a friendship/messaging functionality and use Textsecure for that, so the messages can be encrypted. So no user has to have 10 Apps that have their own messaging and contacts. You only have one installed and you can use every feature of this 10 Apps in one. A Permission System should be included.

		When your contact's key changes and you try to scan their QR code through the &quot;You may wish to verify this contact&quot; link the keys won't match because the QR scan expects the old key even though the hex fingerprint screen shows the new key. Steps: Your contact's key changes They send you a message. You tap the message to open the &quot;The identifying material for contact has changed...&quot; dialog Tap the link &quot;You may wish to verify this contact.&quot; Notice that you see two fingerprints on this verification screen (and their fingerprint is the new one) Open the QR code scanning mode You either a) get a toast &quot;Recipient has no identity key!&quot; (in the case your contact has no previous key anymore - e.g. they unregistered at some point) OR b) Barcode Scanner opens, you scan their QR code, and you will get the dialog saying &quot;WARNING, the scanned key DOES NOT match! ...&quot; You can see the mismatch when you compare the fingerprint verification screen opened through the lock icon vs. the screen opened through the &quot;You may wish...&quot; link. As expected the former shows the old fingerprint and the latter shows the new one. However in the latter screen the QR code matching seems to still use the old key.

This appears to be related to the count of numbers attached to a contact - having the mobile number + that contact as whatsapp-contact with the same number has the contact appear twice (with the same number) - if that contact is also on facebook (or has 2 numbers) that contact appears 4 times. phone: oneplus one, stock 5.0.2 android (as delivered by oneplus), official textsecure app from the appstore (reinstalled today) (2.25.3).

		Currently you can only set the ringtone and vibration individually for each contact/thread. It would be very useful to be able to set the LED color so you can see at a glance who wrote, also it'd be useful to be able to set notification level (name, message, none) shown on an individual basis so I can see the messages eg my wife writes at a glance but business contacts are more confidential and only show the name.

I almost missed out on Football today when a friend invited me last night and I never got alert. I had the thought to open the app this morning and luckily was able to respond in time.

		Would it be possible, if I start a message to a new phone number, to check whether that number can receive push messages and perform the handshake prior to the first message? I recently added a contact I knew would have TextSecure, so I was able to verify that this either isn't supported or isn't working. I have a suspicion that this might not easily work with the contact discovery mechanism, and if so, I can continue creating contacts before texting them.

		It seems like TextSecure does not ask for &quot;new&quot; messages when regaining internet connection after being in airplane mode or something similar. Is this assumption correct? Reproduce: Switch on airplane mode Make someone write you a message Switch off airplane mode --&gt; Notification for the new message won't get triggered Open TextSecure app --&gt; New message is displayed Expected: It should listen to the system event of regaining an internet connection and then automatically download new messages and notify about them.

I could send messages just fine, and I could send other pictures, it's just that this one picture just didn't want to download.

			<summary>Problems with properly accessing contacts stored via CardDAV on older Android devices?</summary>

			<bugID>Issue #4100</bugID>
			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		Could it be that TextSecure has problems with contacts stored via CardDAV on older Android devices? Since a couple of weeks (then on 2.25.3, now 2.26.5) I'm experiencing some problems. I have all my contacts stored via CalDAV, none on the SIM card and none on the phone (that runs on 4.2.2). Since a couple of weeks almost all TS-using contacts are shown twice in the list of TS users (and once under &quot;All contacts&quot;). Only newly added TS contacts are listed once. It started when I used TS 2.25.3. Today I noticed that one contact was listed (in the conversations list and in TS' contacts list) without her name, only by her number. Although the native contacts app shows a perfectly fine entry, when I tried to call that person, her name was not shown when dialing (as it would normally happen); instead her number was listed as an &quot;other&quot; number---in the native contacts app, her number is labeled &quot;mobile&quot;. In fact, when I tried to edit the contact in the native contacts app, at the bottom there is an entry for TextSecure (that cannot be edited) that indicates that the number is stored on the phone with the label &quot;other&quot;. (In turn, when I restrict the contacts to app to show contacts stored on the phone only, it lists none, as I would expect.) Does that imply that TS creates a local copy of the CardDAV phone number on the phone? In fact, said contact is one the many duplicates. I played around and &quot;separated&quot; and re-&quot;joined&quot; the varying accounts via which I'm connected to said person in the native contacts app. Now her name (instead of her number only) is listed twice again in the list of TS users, but the two entries are not listed in two subsequent rows, but the first entry jumped to the very top of the list, before the names starting with an A. I repeated that exercise with another duplicate entry, to the same effect: it seems that a second list of TS users is created that is alphabetically ordered and stacked on top of the other one. Apologies for this lengthy post. The only previous issue I found that mentions CardDAV is WhisperSystems#2533, which &quot;solved&quot; itself when the user updated to a higher Android version.

		I recently had to change my phone number and used the recommended protocol from the support pages to do so: http://support.whispersystems.org/customer/portal/articles/1468975 After reenabling push messages everything worked fine on my side, but most of my contacts only received an error instead of my messages (Message encrypted for non-existant session). After they sent a message to me this problem was resolved. I guess a new session was opened by that? Furthermore my old number did still show up in all of my group conversations and broke them for everybody (Error sending message). As I can't reactivate my old number, our only option was to create new groups. My first attempt to do so was also unsuccessful because of the session errors mentioned above. Half of the members still had their old session with me and only received notification about an &quot;unknown group&quot; in which they could not read or write. I'm not familiar with the specifics of how Textsecure handles sessions or group conversations, so all I can do is report this strange behaviour and hope for some smart people to figure out what went wrong here.

Current Behaviour: SMS messages sent from PersonB to PersonA are shown in blue. Problems Caused: PersonA does not know if the message sent from PersonB was sent securely. PersonA may assume PersonB has connectivity due to them sending messages, and thus wrongly assume their messages have been received.

Attach an audio file and send. Attach a 13 second video and send. Scroll up. The conversation list should display (from top to bottom): hi, hihi, hihihi, image thumbnail, audio icon, video icon. Instead it displays: image thumbnail, audio icon, video icon, image thumbnail (same as first), audio icon, video icon.

		If I receive a TS notification and then turn my screen on, pull down notifications on the lock screen and then pull down to expand the TS notification, then tap to open it, I am correctly sent to the thread with that contact BUT when the thread opens it can take a few literal seconds for the conversation colors to populate. This is on a stock Verizon S5 using TS 27.2.

		It does not seem possible to delete drafts (at least I'm not able to find any possibility to do so). If the possibility exists a pointer how to do it would be welcome, otherwise this would be a very useful feature since it's not uncommon to start a message which becomes obsolete shortly after. A quick way to get rid of the obsolete draft would increase usability considerably.

		The prequisite would be including barcode scanner into TextSecure/Signal and to move the &quot;end secure session&quot; to the three dot menu. Tapping the lock would enable QR code verification immediately. When Axolotl protocol assigns Alice and Bob roles to devices by comparing the base key, they could also be used assign roles for QR-code verification: e.g. display QR code on Alice's device and open camera on Bob's device. Bob could then scan both fingerprints from Alice's device at the same time: It could both verify that Bob's device had received the proper key from Alice, and that the proper key was delivered to Alice's device. After verification, Bob's device would either report successful verification or MITM risk. Here's a mockup I made: This approach would reduce the amount of user interaction from nine taps to two, and after crude measuring, verification would be 20 seconds faster.

		I recently switched to a new android phone. I installed textsecure from scratch (same phone number) and everything except for groups is fine again. The first thing I noticed: I can't see the groups I'm in, so I can't send messages to these groups. But the more annoying bug is the following: I received a message from a group I'm in. I can read it and I see who wrote it. BUT: I can't respond. When I touch the field for text input nothing happens. The name is simply &quot;Unnamed group&quot;. I can't see the group members.

		Using Signal 3.0.1 (beta) for Android on a Nexus 5. Debug log (though I doubt you'll want it) is https://gist.github.com/526f0bbf1de80801e008 On WhatsApp, when I attach a contact, it brings up the contact's record with checkboxes next to each item of information that you have for him/her (e.g. numbers and email addresses) and you can choose which you want to include. You then click send and it sends them all together as a record, formatted specially. Clicking on it in the WhatsApp chat then allows you to add that information to your contacts (giving you the option to add it to an existing contact, or create a new contact, as is normal for receiving a contact). It also has a clever little message icon under the contact record that allows you to send a WhatsApp message to that contact straight away without adding them to your address book. The interface in Signal is much less developed. When you select attaching contact information on the same contact, it only shows me the phone numbers for the contact (rather than the email addresses) and selecting one just inserts the number alone (with no name or formatting). I would like to see Signal send a proper contact record with a similar flow to that described above for WhatsApp, at least if the recipient is also a Signal/TextSecure user and the message is being sent over the data channel.

		I tested and found that a &quot;direct capture&quot; (image only, no text) which I sent to someone cannot be resent, or copied/pasted into a new message. The only way is to decrypt/save into a file, and then to compose a new TS with that image as attachment. If my observation is correct - that a &quot;direct capture&quot; cannot be copied, or resent, for technical reason, --&gt; then I suggest to disable those context menu items (long-click onto d-c-message) which are not available in that case (do not show the copy/paste item, do not show the resend function, but show the save-to-file icon for a direct capture message).

		Colors per contact is a nice feature but I would prefer to have a default color for each contact until I want to customize. The reason is that most colors look quite aggressive and I would prefer to have the system theme applied instead (which is softer for the eyes). Could you foresee an option/default behavior where all chats have the system theme and contact color customization remains available in individual conversion settings? 👍 1

Now TextSecure keeps defaulting to sending her encrypted SMSs even though she doesn't have Signal installed anymore. So I'll send her texts and get no reply, not always realizing they were all encrypted and she didn't get any of them. Then I have to copy them, hold down the button to switch to unencrypted, and resend them all.

		I'm not familiar with the redphone internals, so correct me if I misunderstood something... I have two devices running Signal 3.0.2. They were exchanging messages and where having some calls. Now device A reinstalled Signal (resulting in a new identity key) and called device B. The call was established without problems, no warning was given. Writing a message from A to B lead to a warning (&quot;Receives message with unknown identity key...&quot;). Shouldn't be there a warning during the call as well? This allows to impersonate someone else, no?

		TextSecure won't work without Google Play or the underlying Google Play services. I think this is a bad situation: IMHO the secure open-source messenger app, with strong open crypto relies on a proprietary (right? It's not open source, or is it?) library from a US based company. If the whatsapp client uses the TS-protocol, why should I use TS? There are quite some gappless phones and honestly, it is either Gapps and TS or no Gapps and no Messenger-App at his point. :) Also compare for #725.

		I'm using Signal 3.0.3 and have been using it for awhile now. I'm not seeing Redphone users as &quot;signal-callable&quot; users: no phone with lock, just a plain phone icon. I am able to text them securely just fine though. I DO however see my lone iPhone Signal user as a callable contact. I then got together with a friend using 2.28.1 and Redphone. From their Redphone contact list I'm still registered there and called my phone from there and I received it inside of Signal and was able to talk. I have of course pulled to refresh numerous times and even re-registered Redphone on my friend's phone thinking maybe that would alert something as to being callable.

		The following has happened for the first time, after many months of TS working flawlessly on this phone: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/723ba29a67dcafdd3664 I sent a plain SMS message as expected (and done many times before) with TS. It was received by the adressee. Hours later, I found the GSM network &quot;unavailable&quot; (supposedly due to GSM hiccup, as the phone wasn't moved nor touched). I enabled, then re-disabled flight mode in order to cleanly reconnect to the tower. As soon as this happened, I was briefly notified that TS had troubles sending a message, and TS apparently started to flood the send queue with hundreds of resending attempts. Unfortunately, many (if not all) succeeded, giving the stunned recipient a massive SMS flood / DOS experience. There was a system popup dialog asking if I wanted to allow TS to send the high number of SMS messages it tried to, but the phone (S5, normally very fast and slick ROM) was so busy sending and playing sound alerts that dialog didn't seem to care about my answer (or was immediately replaced by a new instance, I don't know). I shut off the phone and restarted, but as soon as GSM was connected, the mess continued. Alas, I did not manage to capture any logs. When the phone finally got reponsive again, they appeared empty (I looked with System Tuner Pro).

		My friend is in a timezone 1h ahead of mine. When they send me a message, TS shows the time as one hour ahead of the current local time. There are two problems with this: It is confusing for the user when following the conversation / reading the message. The conversation list shows the conversation as 23h in the past, sorted below a conversation that was only a few &quot;proper&quot; hours in the past. Possible reason for the time difference: My friend did not set the timezone, but the time, when traveling to their current location. Thus our timezones are the same, but their time is wrong. I did not ask them to confirm that, yet. What I would expect from TS: When a conversation is in the future, show it above all others (sorted by relative/signed time difference), instead of sorting it by absolute/unsigned time difference. The server could append its own time, so that the receiving client has three times: sent-by-sender, received-by-server, received-by-recipient. Then: TS could show all three times in the message details. In the conversation view, it could show the time that (roughly) agrees with the others, filtering the third from the user's view by default. E.g. show an average of the two (of all three) times with the least difference.

		Hi, I am running updated textsecure on an HTC One M7 with Android 5.0.2. Yesterday, a friend with Signal on iOS tried to send me a picture. I have received messages and pictures from that person just fine before. But I got the &quot;incoming MMS failed&quot; instead of the actual picture. When I clicked on the &quot;resend&quot; link to the right of the message, it crashed the app. I then tried to re-open the app, but it immediately crashed and then gave the &quot;Unfortunately, TextSecure has stopped&quot; pop-up, and that pop-up comes up twice. I have tried restarting and powering off/on my phone, but still can't open TextSecure and get the same error message twice. The strange thing though is that I can see my new messages (from a different Signal user) that have come in by swiping down on the notification banner. But I can't reply because that would require actually opening the app, which isn't happening. I don't know how to send a log, but if this is something you can look into, please respond and I'll try to work with you on it. Thank you!

		Me (A) and two other persons (B,C) are using TextSecure (the current version 2.28.1) for several months to communicate via encrypted messages (showing the lock icon). Another person (D) has just got Signal freshly installed and registered (on iOS 8.4.1). She has got the phone numbers of A,B,C in her contacts (but strangely her Signal contact list shows A and B, not C). When A now sends a message to D, it shows the lock, and D can answer via Signal. However, we did not manage to send encrypted messages from B or C to D, and from D to B or C: B's and C's TextSecure always falls back to 'unsafe SMS', and D's Signal does not even offer to send a message to B or C. It seems that D's Signal did not find out that B and C are registered TextSecure users. I have put a protocol of B at https://gist.github.com/77a449110e97b2aecf39, and one of D at https://gist.github.com/ff7d002f0eb2f0d27883.

		Hi, one issue that comes up frequently when I make TextSecure/Signal calls with extended family is uncomfortable fingerprint-verification word choices. For example, today I had to explain to my parents why the words &quot;retouch puberty&quot; came up on their phone. Some other possibilities that will probably happen to people at some point: &quot;newborn puberty&quot; &quot;showgirl penetrate&quot; &quot;facial escapade&quot; &quot;adult visitor&quot; 95% of the time it doesn't matter at all, but if it were possible, I'd prefer that the word combinations be extremely boring. I want to be able to recommend Signal to anyone without worrying about whether they'll get weird words and end up being creeped out. I'd be happy to go through and change the words in src/org/thoughtcrime/redphone/crypto/zrtp/SASCalculator.java, but I think there may be some additional work to do around versioning. Is changing this list possible / realistic? If you all think this should be changed too, I'm happy to help... I was building TS from source for a while but stopped a few months ago. I don't mind getting everything set up again if it means this will get changed.

			<description>
		When I try to initiate a new call I immediately get an error &quot;Anmeldung fehlgeschlagen!&quot; (RedPhone_login_failed). This is on a OnePlus 2 with latest Oxygen version. The phone seems to have some issues regarding not knowing if it wants 32 or 64 bit. I had that with another app (https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn) where it tried to use the 32 bit libs instead of the 64 bit ones. I don't know how this was fixed though. This is just an estimated guess, if I can help with debugging, let me know (but you have to tell me how).

		So, I had an Experia Z1 months back. I tried TextSecure over a year ago and thought it was OK, but I didn't really commit and so removed it. Factory-erased it a couple months back and sold it, bought a Galaxy S6. Didn't install Signal at all. When I look in the play store, it says it's installed. Doesn't say where tho. I'm allowed to install it and it offers my Galaxy. The Experia no longer shows in my devices as of course I removed it. To be clear - Signal is absolutely NOT installed on my Galaxy and never has been. He texted me yesterday via signal and it said it was delivered securely. I didn't receive it (of course, I don't have Signal). So I texted him a normal SMS today and it came up on his device with the little padlock. How is this? I can't possibly have sent him a secure message, and where are his messages to me going? When he goes to message me, it says &quot;Send Signal message&quot;, which would have led him to believe it was encrypted and being sent to me. I've kept my same mobile number, and the buyer of my experia didn't get any old sim cards or anything. So, ummm... bug?

		At least some users in Mexico are having difficulty registering with Signal. As far as I've heard, this is an ongoing problem that also affected TextSecure. The symptoms I've seen are that 1) SMS registration does not work - the registration times out unsuccessfully. 2) The user can successfully register using voice verification, and an encrypted session can be initialized, and messages sent back and forth. 3) However, the Mexican phone then decides that it is no longer registered, and encrypted messages cannot be sent or received. I suspect this issue may be related to #3360 - there are multiple valid formats for a Mexican phone number. I've posted a debug log.

		So a friend of mine recently changed their sim card and thus got a new phone number. In the normal Signal chat session pane it will show the person's name with their phone number below it. However, this number has stayed the same when I view my chat with this person. I actually had no idea this person had changed their sim/number until a few weeks later, even though I was frequently messaging them via Signal. After they told me I then added their number to my contacts list (so now both the new and old numbers are listed under their name in my phone's contacts list). However, the Signal chat pane still shows the old number. I should point out that this in no way affects functionality of the app, it's purely the aesthetical display of the phone number under their name. If this is due to the fact I still have the old number saved, I cannot remove that as that friend still swaps between the 2 sims on rare occasions.

		Hello As @moxie0 stated here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10498671 he would be pleased to see a 'API-compatible open source implementation of play services' to make it possible to use signal with GMS without the need to install GAPPS. Well, there is now good progress in this direction with the project microG GmsCore. This aims to be a 'framework to allow applications designed for Google Play Services to run on systems, where Play Services is not available'. Would it be possible to accept this as an alternative? At the moment this project can be used to run Signal without GAPPS. The disadvantage is that microg GmsCore needs to fake app signatures at the moment to get Signal running. This is a huge security risk. If Signal would accept microg GmsCore as an alternative to the proprietary implementation, there would be no need anymore to tamper with the android security system. What do you Signal developers think about this and would you consider this as an alternative? Kind regards. PS: I am not affiliated with this project.

I think it would look much better if the attachment drawer had the size of the keyboard, or the keyboard gets closed before. I don't have this problem with the emoji drawer, the behaviour there is perfect! Nexus 4, 5.1.1 HTC Desire, 2.3.7

		I guess this is somehow related to #4029, but that one seems to be fixed - while I'm still experiencing that kind of issue. Almost all of my contacts appear a couple of times in Signal's contact list - with all of their different phone numbers. So far, so good (expected behaviour). But many have additional duplicate entries with the same number (it's always a mobile number) listed twice. One of them has the format +12 345 67890 (which is exactly how I format all of my phone book's entries). The other one (the duplicate) has the very same number, but formatted as +1234567890 (a format not to be found in my phone book). I've noticed that - as far as I looked - each of the contacts with this kind of duplicate has an WhatsApp entry in Android's phone book (actually 2 entries - one for calls and one for messages). Interestingly, though, the WhatsApp entries in Android's phone book are also (sort of correctly) formatted as +12 345 67890. I don't necessarily say that the WhatsApp entries are the culprit (i. e. they confuse Signal). But it surely looks like they are. It has been like this for a long time, but I just took the time to inspect this more closely. I'm using vanilla Android 6 on a Nexus 5 with Signal 3.3.0.

		I read #127, but now: You can install F-droid as system app and keep &quot;unknown sources&quot; disabled To use Signal on CyanogenMod I would have to flash/install gapps, but I consider gapps to be a privacy risk.

		The ability to record and send voice notes in the app similar to other messaging apps would be useful. Whatsapp version = https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/android/23684991

		I see that with 8fd0ea3 the quick picture mode uses the front facing camera by default. I personally don't like it, but if you think that for most people it's more &quot;useful&quot; like this, then fine. I suggest to make Signal remember the last used camera (either per-conversation or application-wide). This would make most people happy and I think it fits within your development guidelines (don't add settings, ...).

		Signal 3.3.0, other side the latest iOS version. Yesterday I received a Signal call. While calling (on speaker) I received a (little bit) delayed Signal message from the same person. I pulled down the notification drawer to see tghe message and got in the standard Signal messages screen. When I pushed the back button I more or less expected to re-enter the call screen but I got in the list of conversations. Is that intended? When I re-opened the conversation with the person who was calling (we could continue to talk during this) and pushed the call button I re-entered the Redphone call screen.

		If I only add one person or confirm the group configuration without any changes all participants are listed as joined and the unchanged group name is listed as new group name. Found in build 3.3.1. For me it looks like a regression that has possibly been introduced with the fix that replaces numbers with names for joined participants.

		I've noticed that many wiki pages need an update and/or are missing. For examle the 'redphone protocol' page is not reachable since the github repo was taken down. Another thing i noticed is the protocol is still called textsecure protocol v2. Since this is the only protocol signal has ever supported i suggest we just call it the signal protocol. (this is kind of off topic but is why I was looking for the wiki page: how much is shared between the messaging and calling protocols? Is the calling protocol zrtp as claimed here? If this is true it means it does not have the self healing properties of the axolotl ratchet, right?)

		I have friends who always want to mute certain groups. Currently, it's only possible to mute groups one week at a time, which can get really cumbersome. I'd be convenient for them to have the option to mute these groups for a really long time. Is there any rationale not to extend the muting options with longer periods, like &quot;1 year&quot; or &quot;forever&quot; (9999 years)?

		You probably know of things like charities using numbers such as 85474 (made up number) to donate. Attempting to send a text to such a number from Signal results in the country code being added, so from where I live, it became +4485474 and thus failed.

		Hello. I wish there was a way of telling who has Signal and who hasn't immediately by looking at the contact's name on the &quot;front page&quot; of Signal. It would only take a tiny lock next to their name. As it is right now, there is no way of teling if a user has Signal or not, unless you click their name. It's not a big deal, I know. But if the long term goal of Signal is to compete with WhatsApp I would say this feature is a necessity. Sorry for a dizzy post, I've had the flu for quite some time now.

		Since commit 5757962 was added, you can now install Signal on WiFi-only devices like tablets. However, if you do this, and register using the same phone number as your phone with a Signal install, your phone will no longer be able to receive or send Signal messages (and vice versa). The obvious solution is better multi-device support, which is already on the roadmap. But until then, there should be some warning that you can only have one device per number right now.

There's no way to keep the screen off during the call. Proximity sensor turning it off doesn't help when you're not holdint the phone to your ear and it shouldn't turn the display on unless pressing the power button again.

		Previous behavior (with Redphone): If I initiated a call from the system dialer for a user that was registered with Redphone, I received a pop-up asking if I wanted to upgrade the call to a Redphone call. In addition, calls showed up in the list of sent, received, and missed calls in the system dialer even if placed via Redphone. Current Behavior: With the introduction of Signal, there is no longer any dialer integration. Why the change matters: I think this was a nice feature as it means a user could simply initiate calls through the system dialer as opposed to opening Signal to initiate a call. This make it more likely that unsophisticated users, like my mother, would actually make secure calls since they don't have to do anything differently. A Google search revealed another user brought up this issue, but attempting to access that page results in a 404. I didn't see any existing issues in Github. Tested with Signal 3.1.1 and 3.3.1 on Cyanogenmod 11 (Milestone 11), Android 4.4.4, on a One Plus One (A0001).

 When i try to call my number from another signal instance (from Google Playstore) then an error message is displayed saying that the called party (me) is not capable of encrypted calls. But when i use the librephone app (xmikos) on my mobile to call the other way around it works very well. Please note that i do use the websocket version from xmikos. My understanding is that this build doesn't change the redphone part of signal so i come here for help.

		Hello. With friends we installed Signal (2 Android users and 1 iPhone) and can't get connected secure calls between us. We verified our keys using barcode scanner and also sending SMS works. When I call a friend (he has same version of Signal, as we all installed it at same time), he gets the call ringing, but when he answers, on my (caller) side Signal still states &quot;Calling&quot; for a while and then drops the call. When he calls me, the situation is same, I get the call but when I answer it just states &quot;establishing connection&quot; or similar and then after a while it drops the connection. We have the same issue when we try to make calls on local Wifi or 3G/4G networks. I use Android 5.1.1. (non-roted, original ROM), Samsung S6 Edge Friend uses Android 5.0.2. (non-roted, original ROM), Samsung Note 3 Friend uses iPhone 5. Here is the full debug log from my phone: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3b39245965aeafc299de

		Any plans to add the same feature as Wickr ? ie. allowing one user to attach to a message a period at the end of which the message is destroyed locally and remotely (on both the sender and receiver phones). Like you can see on this screenshot of Wickr, you set up a time bomb on every new message, and all past message have an indication of when they will be deleted: Signal allow this locally but not remotely such as Wickr does. With this feature, there would be no more reason to use Wickr over Signal ! Thanks !

		I see two different behaviours when I am in Canada and in Chile, whenever I send a SMS (non-secure text message). In Canada (koodo), I see a check next to the message I sent, and that is. Good. In Chile (virgin, a virtual provider), I see a check, but I also receive from 1 to 3 extra messages saying: Mensaje fue recibido por +56######### . (which translates to Message was received by +56######### .) I believe I receive 1 message for as many cell-operators (roaming) the message have passed to get to its destination. And I guess that because the message is in Spanish, Signal does not parse it in order to hide it or change it for something else. The annoying part is that in a conversation, it appears that infamous message every time I sent something, so the thread is hard to follow. Besides that I get a notification when I have not received an actual reply, tricking me. If you point me in the right direction, I might provide a patch to fix it. Update: Android 4.4, Signal 3.3.1 (when it just became Signal from TextSecure).

		Over the last several days, I've noticed that messages are occasionally not being delivered (one checkmark) and I am unable to initiate a secure call to said contact. I confirmed that the user's phone was on at the time, he had a data connection (Wifi), and in fact the Signal app was opened in the background. The user was able to receive emails and regular phone calls without issue. Restarting the Signal app fixed the problem. In addition, after restarting the app, he recevied all my previous messages. This user was running Android 4.4.4 on a One Plus One with Signal 3.1.1. I had a similar issue with a Signal iOS user (Signal 2.2, iOS 8.4.1, iPhone 5S). Messages to that user went through nearly instantly but I was unable to initiate a secure call. However, the user could call me via Signal, and my phone rang nearly instantly. When the user closed the Signal app, I was able to initiate a call, and it rang on her phone within a second. I understand that Google Cloud Messaging is believed it be causing delayed message delivery intermittently. However, the behavior I'm seeing appears to impact both iOS and Android clients, the messages are not merely delayed but do not arrive at all until the app is restarted, and when the recipient restarts his/her Signal applicaiton, new messages sent to that user are delivered within seconds. As noted above, calls are also impacted. I can't see why restarting Signal would suddenly make GCM more reliable, so it seems there may be a bug in Signal causing the delays and inability to initiate secure calls. Would logs useful? If so, do you want them for me (sender) or the recipient that isn't receiving the messages?

		When creating a group with one or more contacts which aren't registered with Signal, there is a very clear notification that an MMS group will be created, which could lead to additional costs. Current experience: When someone unregisteres from Signal while s/he is part of a group, the other group members receive error messages saying the message couldn't be sent, even tough it is in fact sent to the remaining members of the group. The error message is even more confusing, because the message has the same &quot;click for more details&quot; notification next to it like messages that failed to send because the server couldn't be reached. In the latter case you can see to which members the message failed to send and just click &quot;resend&quot; to resolve the issue. In the &quot;a member of a signal group unregistered&quot; case there are no more details and nothing to do for the user. Proposed experience: When Signal notices that a group member is no longer registered, there should be a notification that this member was removed from the group and has to be readded manually if they register again. A fallback to MMS would probably be the worst option, because it could create huge intransparent costs e.g. for European users, leading to the immeadiate removal of the app. I'm looking forward to your thoughts and improvement ideas! Edit: The messages are usually delivered even if the error message is shown. But the constant error messages confuse users and make them loose faith in the app.

		When you sync Signal with your contact, you get two additional fields: &quot;Signal call&quot; and &quot;Message&quot;. When you change the language of your device it used to be enough to just resync and the language of theses field would also change. Not anymore. You have to remove and readd the Signal account in the Android settings. It is probably not a important bug because except me, nobody changes the language on a daily basis but well. I think I should mention it.

		When I look at a contact in my android contact app, if it's a Signal contact, I have two of the same Signal icons, one for call and one for message but I don't know the difference before pressing them. For the normal phone call icon it shows options in the window below. I don't know if consolidating the actions and using one icon, or having two slightly different icons with different actions is better. Something to think about.

		It is impossible to send SMS to short numbers because it automatically adds the country code at the beginning of the number. For example for 2282 it adds +47 to the number so it will be +47 2282 if you live in Norway, that makes it impossible to send because the GSM networks (at least here in Norway) don't allow +47 in front of short numbers. I tried with version 3.3.3.

		In SaveAttachmentTask.java, the call to mimeTypeMap.getExtensionFromMimeType(contentType) with the type image/jpg returns null on devices with the AOSP version of MimeUtils.java. This is because the Android platform doesn't recognize image/jpg as a valid MIME type. With the image/jpeg type, however, an extension is returned as expected. MimeUtils.java (AOSP)     add(&quot;image/ief&quot;, &quot;ief&quot;);
    // add &quot;.jpg&quot; first so it will be the default for guessExtensionFromMimeType
    add(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;jpg&quot;);
    add(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;jpeg&quot;);
    add(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;jpe&quot;);
    add(&quot;image/pcx&quot;, &quot;pcx&quot;);
 I've dealt with issues in the past where device manufacturers have edited this map (love you, Samsung ㅗ*.*ㅗ), which may result in sending devices using content types which receiving devices cannot look up via getExtensionFromMimeType. Where to put a sanitizer might be a bit tricky. I'll dig deeper tomorrow.

		There should really be an option to send encrypted SMS instead of solely relying on an internet connection for encrypted chat. I mean, it's definitely possible between Signal users. The problem arises when one party does not have an internet connection, but both parties have a mobile signal. You have to resort to insecure SMS in order to get a message through. This shouldn't be the case. Between signal users, it should seamlessly be able to switch between secure SMS and secure IM when available.

		I have found something pretty annoying when recording voice messages. The last half a second or so always gets trimmed. My understanding is that the recording must be a multiple of 1 second, so if you record for 8.4 seconds you will lose the last 0.4 seconds. I don't have sound evidence for this but after several attempts it looks like it (or maybe it's just my imagination but the fact remains that I can't hear the last word I say in most messages).

		With signal 3.5.0 I get the following issue: Somebody who is not in my contact list sends me a push message. Two issues arise: Although he is using Signal for iOS I cannot respond to the message with an encrypted call (padlock symbol next to phone symbol is missing). The padlock symbol appears when I go into the new message screen and pull down the contact list to refresh the push information. I then have a conversation with the person via push messaging and later add him to my contact list. Some time after I add him I get a push notification stating &quot;... is now on Signal, say hey!&quot;, although the contact was Signal user before he first contacted me.

Are these linebreaks actually useful for how the app runs, or are they there just to keep the line lengths in res/values/strings.xml under a certain limit? If it's the latter, then maybe they should be removed, because when translating in Transifex, they appear in a rather weird way, and the Transifex interface sometimes complains that they are not translated correctly, even when it appears completely artificial.

			<description>
		Latency: Perhaps the most notable difference between making a Signal and a standard cell phone call is the latency encountered. In fact, it was the very first comment one of my friends mentioned when we initiated the call. RTT appears to be at least 1 second even when the person I'm calling is relatively close (several hundred miles on the East cost of the US, where Signal has a server - can't find the link now but Moxie published a blog post indicating where Signal has servers for routing calls). However, when I call the same person on Jitsi, the RTT is below 100 ms, and latency is barely noticeable. We are both connecting via Wifi using broadband connections with at least 50 Mbit down and 10 Mbit of upload capacity for him and 100/100 for me (Fiber on my end, cable on his). Jitsi shows effectively 0% packet loss and sub 5ms jitter with RTT typically around 50 ms. Thus, I would not expect significant latency in Signal given our geographic proximity and high speed, relatively low-latency connections. In fact, my Signal calls to the US from China seemed to have similar latency to the East Cost - East Coast US calls. Audio Quality: The audio quality in Signal appears to generally be worse than a cell phone call, and is significantly worse than Jitsi or Skype (both of which use wideband codecs - SILK for Skype IIRC and Opus @ 48 Khz for Jitsi). In addition, I notice more cut-outs and audio distortions with Signal. Again, both callers are on Wifi with high-speed broadband connections and are in relatively close physical proximity. I would imagine that implementing Opus in Signal would improve call quality generally, particularly if it is allowed to run in a wideband setting, as Opus is superior to Speex at all bitrates/sampling rates per the documentation. However, I'm rather perplexed about the subjectively high latency. Note: Wasn't sure whether to post this here or on the mailing list. Please advise.

		When sending a media message with a PNG attachment, Signal converts the PNG to JPEG (and scales it) before sending. Later, when choosing to save the image from the conversation, this JPEG is saved with a &quot;.png&quot; extension. This occurs because Attachment#updateAttachmentData replaces the attachment data stream without updating the attachment content type. Steps to reproduce Take a completely unamusing screenshot (PNG) to send to a contact Open Signal Open the conversation with said contact Tap the Attach button Tap the Image button Select the new screenshot from the documents provider Observe the draft media message with thumbnail Tap the Send button Wait for the media message progress to complete (converting to JPEG, scaling, sending) Long press the media message Tap the Save button Reluctantly embrace the security warning Observe the new Signal-yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss.png in /sdcard/Pictures adb pull this curious file and check check it Behold, a JPEG in disguise Device info: Nexus 5, stock Android 6.0 MRA58K, Signal 3.5.0 (473e470) App state: Signal registered, SMS enabled, default SMS app

		I'm relatively new to both Android and Signal, so this could be my own mistake. I've noticed that messages only arrive when I'm on a WiFi network. Over my mobile network (4G) I never receive message. I notice this when I finally connect to a WiFi network and the messages come flooding in. I checked the Signal settings but can't see anything that would affect this. I've also checked to ensure background data is allowed both globally for mobile internet, and specifically for Signal.

		Signal can literally expire any second, so that out of a sudden you are not able to send messages anymore (well, of course only if you do not update it for 90 days). Immediately updating the app right then might not be possible if you require a wifi connection. I am sure that this is not a problem for any of the people involved here, but for other non tech-savvy users it can be (firsthand experience). Reasons for apps not updating automatically: new permission required (happened before the RedPhone integration) not enough free space on the device available for some other reason... it is not uncommon for me to see 10 or so pending app updates on other peoples's devices There should be a time-triggered warning, or some other trigger to inform the user beforehand.

		I had created a group and added people to it. All was OK until I kept getting failures in sending messages. I rebooted my phone (N5 fully updated) and even then it could not send. I could send to one-on-one message threads, just not groups. The group that I was trying to send to was created by me and I am not sure if I had added others to be admin as well. I deleted the app and reinstalled from Google Play. But I cannot get back into that group now. The group still exists and the others in the group are able to communicate. They do see my phone trying to reconnect and being told to accept me. It seems that I did get accepted but what I see on my phone after being accepted is a group name that is: &quot;unamed group&quot; and &quot;textscrure_grop!9...&quot;. I cannot enter any text, image etc. I do see others posting messages but I cannot respond at all. What additional info can I gather to try to debug? Thanks.

		I know that the Chrome extension hasn't officially been released yet, but since it looks like it's getting closer, I might as well point out this issue I'm having. Put your phone in offline mode; Use the Signal-chrome to send some messages to some people. Wait until they are delivered; Turn on your phone's wifi/data. All the messages will be synced, but they will appear as not delivered. I think this is a problem with the app on Android and not the browser extension because this problem is less frequent if I leave my phone's data on (though it's definitely still present, just not 100% of the time).

		After I sent an encrypted message to my only signal-using contact this morning (who for some reason sometimes sends me encrypted texts and sometimes unencrypted), Signal suddenly began the registration process again. I received a message before it finished, and my reply was sent unencrypted. After exchanging a couple unencrypted messages, clicking the button that appeared up top to enable encrypted functionality and seeing the registration window again, I generated a debug log: https://gist.github.com/e79519a8188d259844c0 . My device and app version are listed there: Device : samsung SGH-T399 (gardaltetmo) Android : 4.2.2 (T399UVUAOH2, JDQ39.T399UVUAOH2) App : Signal 3.5.2 After three attempts to register, I had successfully registered again. The first two were interrupted by incoming messages or my attempt to generate a bug report. During this time I successfully received an unencrypted MMS from my contact. This was the first time I had successfully received an MMS on this phone; this was also my first signal mms. Earlier I was using smssecure and my mms images just showed as &quot;trying to contact server&quot;. Signal would not complete registration until I'd uninstalled smssecure. I asked my contact to generate a debug log. Here it is: https://gist.github.com/4837204c21c5b7c2ece4 My preferences: Receive all SMS, all MMS; SMS delivery reports on; Wifi Calling disabled. Notifications enabled; default ringtone; vibrate on; LED blue; LED blink normal; in-thread notifications enabled; never repeat alerts; display name and message in notifications passphrase disabled; screenshots blocked; no blocked contacts dark theme media auto-download only when using wifi (my phone is on wifi now); do not delete old messages no linked devices signal messages and calls enabled; enter key does not send; do not use system emoji

		Hi, I couldn't find where can translate the description of the app for Play store. For example, if the app is viewed in the Play store in Hebrew, then the short description is shown in machine translation, which is incorrect, and makes it hardly possible to understand what the app is, because it auto-translates the word &quot;Signal&quot; to a Hebrew word that is unrelated to the actual app's name, and makes several grammatical mistakes. That's how machine translations usually are. The long description with a list of features is shown in English, without any translation. The solution is to let the translators at Transifex translate these descriptions. That's how it's done for the Wikipedia app, for example, and it works well.

However, this might also be very well my own based perception. PS: I thought there was already an issue created for this idea, but I was unable to find it. Sorry, if this is indeed a duplicate.

		I can remove a complete conversation, including text messages and entries for accepted/missed calls in it. I can also remove single text messages from a conversation. However, I cannot remove just (single or all) call entries from a conversation, which I would have expected to be possible. I rarely delete a complete conversation, as there usually are some messages in it that I still want to keep. This currently implies that I also have to keep all call entries, which is slightly annoying, as they contain practically no information. In my opinion, to make removing call entries possible, there should be at least one of the following features: I should be able to select and remove call entries just like text messages. I should be able to &quot;lock&quot; text messages so they are not removed when I delete the conversation. (This is currently on Signal 3.6.1 on Android.)

		Signal was just updated, so this bug report is for 3.6.0. Debug log, unfortunately after the automatic software update. Every month, on the 1st, my power company sends me an sms asking for the current value of the power meter in my apartment, to keep track of usage. I never received their sms yesterday. I know it was sent, because I also have an app installed which looks up unknown phone numbers and this app triggered and displayed a notification that it had looked up +47 2262, which is the expected number. I'm aware of two other dropped sms. I figured the first one was a network failure, and told my gf to turn on delivery notification. After doing that, she told me one of her messages went undelivered the other day. 👍 1

If so, it should be removed and added to gitignore. If it's sourceless, then information should be there for where it comes from and how to rebuild it.

		Phone: OnePlus Two with CyanogenMod 12.1 Signal version: 3.6.1 Issue: When I am connected to a Wifi network through Shaw (home, wifi hot spots, etc), I cannot send or receive any messages securely. I also cannot un-register or re-register my phone number until I switch to Mobile Data. On Telus Wifi, it works fine. I can still send un-encrypted SMS messages to other contacts. Tonight, a family member that is also on Signal had issues sending and receiving on Shaw. I have contacted Support, but this seems like a big problem. Debug Log shows lots of errors about the certificates; for example, line 21: W/OkHttpClientWrapper(16616): javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.. This error repeats a few times. The date and time on my device is correct, as is the time zone. I do not have any user-installed root certificates.

		With Android sounds set to &quot;Priority Mode&quot;, the incoming message notification sound is still audible when viewing an active conversation. I believe that if priority notifications are turned off for Signal, then all notifications, including in-thread notifications, should be silenced when Android is in priority only mode. So, these in-thread notifications should be silenced as well in &quot;Priority&quot; mode since they are not priority notifications. To clarify, the android priority setting works for the other notifications from the Signal app; the issue only affects the &quot;in-thread&quot; notifications. I am using Signal 3.6.1 on Android 5.1.1. I have an LG Nexus 4 device with T-Mobile USA as the carrier.

		This happened while using Signal 3.6.1 on Android 6.0 I recently got a new phone and some of my contacts did not get migrated. One of those missing contacts sent me a signal message, and then we proceed to exchange a few messages. After manually adding them to my contacts I got a 'Say Hey!' message for them. Since I had just exchanged signal messages with this number, it seems redundant to me.

		At the moment (Signal 3.7) thumbnails for sent images are still cropped versions instead of resized versions of the images. This changes the aspect ratio of the picture and zooms to some &quot;random&quot; area inside the picture. Would love to see the thumbnails rather have a maximum width with fixed aspect ratio. Would make them look so much better.

			<description>
		Feature proposal: Add delivery date/time for outgoing SMS/Signal messages in &quot;message details&quot;. In a similar way that we can see when the incoming message was both sent and delivered in the &quot;message details&quot; dialog, add this functionality to the outgoing messages. Right now, only &quot;sent&quot; date/time is shown there. Regarding privacy implications - this will not change anything there, no extra info is required from the recipient to provide. Just present the already non-secret &quot;second checkmark's timestamp&quot; in a more convenient way to the user (via &quot;message details&quot; dialog). Just as the &quot;second checkmark&quot; itself, the usability of this if obvious, especially if a contact in a bad reception area and you don't get the &quot;second checkmark&quot; right away. For SMS, this functionality is provided by most SMS apps if &quot;delivery receipts&quot; are enabled. So in a way, using Signal as SMS client in current form reduces this sms functionality (so for SMS case it might as well be considered as a bug).

		Since Signal 3.7.0 message delivered/received status in displayed also in the conversation overview screen. However I sometimes notice that a (old) message there only displays one check mark. If I enter the conversation I see that the last message has two check marks. If I then go back to the conversation overview there are also two check marks. I also see this with SMS.

		If you try to send a message in Signal but you have a very poor data signal, Signal send you a notification that your message could not be delivered. After that, the user can manually select something like &quot;Try sending again&quot;. Wouldn't it be a better way to automatically send the message again if the signal is back (like the other messenger apps, e.g. Whatsapp)?

		It would be nice to enable the export/import of the private key (probably protected by a password) in order to avoid having a new identity in case of uninstall+reinstall or in case of use of a new phone: the people I talk to really don't need to be aware of such changes and that would simplify their use of the software.

		Signal should incorporate sending messages via RCS-e. SMS integration is already awesome. RCS-e is being pushed as the next generation messaging protocol by some telecommunication providers but they are all lacking a good app to use the service. Signal could make use of an existing RCS-e service (already present on some devices) or get an option to download the generic RCS-e service APK by the GSMA.

		This is a small change, but it should improve user experience.

Looking at the code, PlaintextBackupImporter.java should probably keep looking for TextSecurePlaintextBackup.xml (besides the new SignalPlaintextBackup.xml) for backward compatibility.

		When joining a new group it's sometimes hard to find out which people belong to which phone number. Asking everyone in the group who they are is tedious. It would be nice to be able to set a nickname in the app, that's sent in an extra field in each group message. The receiving clients could show this nickname if the number has no associated contact. Setting a nickname would of course be optional and the nickname is only sent in group messages. Other messengers support this as well and it's very useful to find out who the person is that just sent a message in a group. 👍 2

		Explicitly disabling all encrypted calling to all parties should be possible somehow since a lot of people complain that its functionality is rather limited at this stage (not working most of the time) but they enjoy the text features of the app which are rather solid. If encrypted calling is disabled the people on the contacts list should be updated via the server that encrypted calling is inhibited for that party and not display a phone locked icon. Previous to the merge of Textsecure and Rephone we had a choice. Now we don't. Maybe an advanced option?

		While Signal currently supports GIFs, it requires storing them on your local device (which is annoying). Since GIPHY has an API for searching GIFs, it should be plausible to implement a client-side feature where the client finds a GIF using GIPHY and then sends it without saving it locally (or temporarily saving it). The only issue I can see is that GIPHY would be told that a particular person is a Signal user.

		Hey guys, I have an OnePlus one with (now) Android 6. I dirty-flashed from Lollipop and got stuck in a Boot-Loop. After that i tried to restore backup to the Lollipop but still Bootloop so i had to make an Factory-Reset on the phone. Now i have an complete Backup of my System with TWRP but can't get it to work with my &quot;new&quot; Signal so my old Keys and Messages won't get lost. The things i tried: Install Signal on new OS and changed the directory /data/data/org.thoughtcrimes.securesms with the one from backup. Also changed owner and group to the new user and group of signal Deinstall everything from Signal. Copy the directory to data/data/ and then install Signal from Play Store in hope it will see that it will find the old files. Still no success Could you give me a hint how to restore my old Keys? My Messages aren't even so importend. Only the Keys. If neccessary i will upload some LogCats if you want to

			<description>
		I installed Signal on Android and very shortly after got messages from two friends who both use Signal congratulating me on installing it. The two conversations were colored primary red and primary green. I assumed that these colors signified some meaning about the conversations like maybe the green one was secure and the red one was insecure. I did some Googling and found Issue #945 which seemed to imply that the issue color indicated the transport medium that the message arrived by. I asked @mfb and he figured out what was going on, that these colors were meant to differentiate conversations from each other. I'd like to recommend / feature request, excluding meaning rich colors from use as differentiating conversation colors, at least initially, to avoid confusing the user. If for example the first two conversations were in pastels or in pretty much any two colors other than red and green (which have a very strong visual meaning of stop/go success/error good/bad) I think I would have begun to intuit that the colors were for conversation differentiation. I'd also say that if it started out with pastels or some other non-meaning-rich colors and I later encountered red and green conversations I'd probably intuit they were just there for differentiation. Since it looks like conversation color is driven directly by the contacts name I'm not sure it would make sense to tweak the initial colors as the user begins using the app. Since, by my read, of the list of colors, only red and green have a strong meaning. All the others seem not meaning rich to me, maybe just remove red and green. Problem there is that existing users mapping of which conversations have which colors would change, possibly confusing people. So, hopefully someone here has a better idea of a solution here than what I've come up with.

		Allow the choice of font size for chat screen : either exact size in points or simply small-medium-large will likely be more than enough. It's a basic option supported by most messengers - even by the stock sms client ! I have a 6&quot; smartphone and the standard font size is way too large for my screen, which could easily and usefully fit much more text. Others, e.g. those with poor eyesight or those with small screens, might find the standard font size too small to read comfortably. I believe this would be a useful feature and one that's probably pretty straightforward to implement. 👍 1

		Signal is my favourite application for both SMS and encrypted messaging. However given the fact that SMS spam is on the rise, It would be a very useful feature to support some sms spam blocking. There are many third party application that do this but they require changing the default SMS application. I think any of the following features would be useful: Options to only issue a notification for messages from known contacts. Word based classification/blacklists (perhaps with an option to never block messages from known contacts) Number blacklists (arguably easy for spammers to circumvent) Of course there are more sophisticated options as well, but these may provide the greatest bang for buck.

		During registration (just after installation) the user has to enter its phone number manually. The national code (e.g. +49 is prefilled). This is not optimal because: Users are (psychologically) relactant to (actively) enter personal data like phone number that is sent to some server (which they've just heard about somewhere). So I've really seen friends aborting the registration at this very step. This is really a UX issue. It's about 9 unnessary keystrokes more At least in Europe people mess up with the leading 0 in phone numbers. A lot of people without internatinal relations do not know (or at least are puzzled about) that the leading 0 is to be ignored after the internal code of +49 Would be good if the users phone number could be automatically retrieved from the phone by Signal and the number prefilled into the input form. A user could still change the prefilled number just in case.

		Other than WhatsApp or Telegram, Signal does not distinguish between a received message and a seen message. Whatsapp and Telegram indicate that a message has been seen by coloring the double check mark. Signal does not color the double check mark. When I first started using Signal, this really confused me. It felt like something did not work, like the other person wasn't reading my messages. I think it might help new users if Signal adopted the de-facto standard by coloring the double check mark in the primary color of the conversation.

		Hi, when a contact changed his key and sends a message to a group, a &quot;you must accept the new key&quot; message appears in his 1-on-1 thread. Once I accept the key, the message is then also displayed in his 1-on-1 thread, and not in the group. I think Signal should decode messages with unknown keys even before the key was accepted (shouldn't be a security risk?), and extract from that where to place the message, i.e. whether it's a 1-on-1 message or a group message.

		Per documentation, the user is unable to get a call-first registration. This alienates users who use calling-only cell plans where sending and receiving texts is possible but costs money. A simple solution would be to add a &quot;call me instead&quot; button to the bottom left of the &quot;Connect With Signal&quot; prompt, which immediately calls the user. This would allow those users to use Signal while causing no friction to anyone else. Side note: Although I do not know for sure, I believe the iOS app behaves in the same way. Can anyone else confirm?

		Hi! I tried to validate my Google Voice number, which I know you have as a known issue as not working. But my issue is why you don't allow manual validation. I to receive the SMS over Google Voice and it's just not caught by the app. The next step is to be called and manually enter what I hear in a text box. My question is: why don't you allow the validation text box to be used for SMS too. It's great that you have the automatic SMS validation (it's user friendly) but after the timeout, you could just leave the option to have the SMS code manually entered. It would offer more flexibility and I don't see what would be the downside (if I am wrong, do tell). Thanks!

		When taking a picture with the front camera using direct capture in collapsed state the resulting image is different compared to the preview. The preview shows the lower portion from a full screen capture, while the resulting image is from the middle portion of a full screen capture. I will try to explain the issue with an image series. The first one is an image of the phone with the camera preview. Note the detail marked with the red circle in the upper right corner. The next one is the preview of the taken picture. Note the detail mentioned before is now in the lower left corner. I wanted to take a screenshot from the camera preview but strangely the screenshot shows the view like for the taken picture. This is why the first pictures a not screenshots. See the third picture. The last image is a full screen capture of the same scene. I suppose the region in the camera preview is different to the final region applied. This happens only with the front camera using direct capture in collapsed state. The back camera works as expected. Device info: Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini, Stock Android 4.4.2, Signal 3.8.1 Debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b3bc25fd68eb6fc8bec2

The connect to server (to request an SMS) succeeds. Then SMS arrives and Signal goes on to generate keys. When that finishes, which is really quick, it complains about not being able to connect to the server. Wait, what? It can contact the servers to send an SMS but is then unable to contact the server? I guess it must be a bug.

		I'm submitting this report on behalf of a concerned friend. Their phone is setup in such a way that many of the contacts stored in the phone are not to be contacted directly (i.e. via the phone number registered with WhisperSystems). These contacts are only to be contacted via some off channel (email, other phone, etc). Anyways, upon installing or updating (I don't recall which it was) to the latest version of Signal, they received a number of 'X is on Signal, say hey!' notifications. Obviously this was very disconcerting, as the first thought was that people on the other end might be receiving similar notifications. Is that the case, or are they &quot;one-way&quot; in the sense that you only receive notifications for numbers that you already have in your contacts? Surely Signal isn't leaking contact details to third-party users... This seemed to be very un-Signal like behavior and the person in question was concerned enough to consider discontinuing use of the app. I wanted to find out more regarding this behavior beforehand, as this issue is very unclear. Perhaps there is some way to opt-out of this (or preferably make it opt-in)? Some clarification would be much appreciated! Thanks for the awesome product by the way.

		Hi, Signal 3.9.0 introduces location messages. While generating such a location message the phone starts GPS service of the device. Typically position precision increases after several seconds in several steps. But Signal stays at the very first (inaccurate) position. Other messengers like Telegram keep track on position updates and always auto-snap to the newest (typically most accurate) position. In Signal I have to press the center button several times before sending the location message in order to send an exact position. It would be great if Signal supports auto-snap like other messengers.

		I've got the Signal Desktop beta and have linked two of my computers to my Android Signal app. However when I try to add a third I get an error telling me I've got too many linked devices and should remove some. Please could this very low limit of two linked devices be raised/removed?

		In the default android's SMS application, it is possible to send multi-party SMS (i.e. the same SMS to hundreds of people). Would be great to have this possibility in Signal, even if it is limited to uncyphered SMSs.

		Unfortunately I am not able to send any pictures out of signal. I tried this with several WIFIs. However, I am not connected thru mobile data, only over WIFI. Sending text messages is no problem and I am receiving pictures from my friends, too. I am not writing about MMS, just attached pictures (with or without text) between internal, encrypted friends.

Signal is my default SMS app. I attempted to answer the SMS and got an error when sending (I still did not add this contact to my address book). Tapping on the failed outgoing message I saw the lock symbol for Signal messages in the lower right corner of the message bubble. When I try to resend, it fails again as the recipient is not a Signal user. Then returning to the conversation, the default method for messaging is correctly an unsecured SMS.

		Hello there i noticed that in SMSSecure (i know where i am) there is kind of a glitch that, if you send out a key-exchange message to a non-SMSSecure user and sayed User forwards you that exact Message, the communication is afterwards shown to be encrypted which it most-likely is but with the own publickey which will result in more gibberish being send to the user. I am not sure if this affects Signal too, which it probably won't as the server automatically checks if sayed user has indeed Signal installed but a basic routine that checks if the send back publickey at key-exchange is indeed not identical to ones own publickey would be appreciated. Truth be told i am by no means a Cryptographer and can not estimate how trivial if at all such a routine would be to be implemented and even if this is something you consider important as it is a probably a rather rare occasion. I am just forwarding this to the crypto-guys which created the underlying protocol in the first place Greetings, Henry Kratom

		Whenever I want to sent a Signal message to more then one person, I need to setup a new group (btw: which is not the best UX imho, a more email like way might be better with being able to have many TO or CC recipients). I already have about a dozen groups now. Unlike the single Signal contacts, that are visible when I tap on the &quot;write new message&quot; button there is no overview of currently existing groups. There is only the initial history of recent messages but for not so often used groups these vanish there quickly and are then hard to find. Maybe there should be an extra tab on the contacts list overview. Or just all groups listed in between the Signal lists and SMS contacts would do too.

		Id like to be able to use signal on my wifi tablet without needing a phone #. Also, requiring a user to sign up with a unique identifier like a phone number seems to be like the first obvious identifier we would not want to require a user to submit if we are interesting in anonymity. Snowden talks about unique identifier databases. Bleep allows account creation with just a key pair. My request is not to require the user to submit identification information on a device that tracks their physical location, can be pinpointed by a stingray, and is most likely directly linked to their billing records. It also makes it a pain to keep a signal account portable when a user changes phone numbers. If a user wants to submit their phone number so that their contacts can locate them that way, fine, but as a requirement its a total game killer.

		At the moment there is only this text in the entry field for sending text which says &quot;send unsecured SMS&quot; or &quot;Send Signal message&quot;. When I open a chat there should be something really obvious to see if I am safe to write something or if I have to be careful. I also noticed once that there was the wrong text. It said &quot; Send unsecured SMS&quot; in a preciously encrypted Signal chat, after restarting the app the text was correct. But again, I think security/privacy is the most important feature this app has to offer. Users should see on first sight if they are on an encrypted channel. Also the contact list UI should be more clear about the difference of SMS vs. Signal chat.

		I just did a factory reset and imported a plaintext backup. Then I noticed that a group I belong to shows only my own messages. All messages from other members are displayed in their individual conversations, not in the group they were originally sent to. Before the reset I made a plaintext backup and left the group. After the reset I imported the backup and had another member add me to the group again. New messages are displayed correctly, it's just the history from the backup that's slightly messed up. After noticing the problem I tried deleting all conversations and importing the backup again but the group history is still spread out across the conversations of the group members. Here is the link to the debug log submitted after the second import: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cc20a61ee143dca2e113 I am also using the Signal Desktop beta. The registered devices seem to keep their own version of the history, even if you re-register, so obviously I did not have to import a backup there. All messages in the group and the conversations with individual contacts are displayed properly on my desktop machines. 👍 1

		If a user unregisteres from Signal but did not leave a group, the user will stay in this group forever and you will get an error for every message you send to that group. I suggest that the all groups of a user should be automatically updated when he unregisters. There are many similar issues but not the same I think (#4550 , #2408 , WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop#448). I fear that this might be an issue for the server because the clients shouldn't do this(?)

		Hi @moxie0, on poor network conditions I often see that Signal indicates a failed delivery while some group members have received the message. Signal does not indicate which group member have received the message and which not. Re-sending leads to some group members receiving the message with multiple copies. In order to avoid such issues it should be possible to implement a solution based on the following principle: Indicate the server that a message to x group members is prepared to be sent Transfer all encrypted messages (for each participant) to the server The server waits until messages for each participant have been received The server delivers the messages Found with Signal 3.9.1.

		Hello! I've installed the Signal app just a few days ago on a Huawei P8 Lite device (Android 5.0.1) and sadly I'm experiencing a bug with notifications, namely: I don't see any notifications about new incoming messages. Only after I manually open the app, see if any new messages were sent. As you can imagine that's a pretty tough bug. Any ideas how to fix it? Other details: notifications for other messaging apps (Viber, What's App) are working all fine. The notifications are turned on in the Signal's settings. Signal is marked as a protected app in the device's settings + notifications for Signal are enabled in the phone's notification center. I was using a Wi-Fi connection to send/receive messages.

		When one person sends a message it appears correctly on my pebble, But when another person sends a message it appears as &quot; sent a message&quot; (paraphrasing). It only fixes its self after one person's messages are marked as read, than the right message suddenly appears on my watch. Pebble doesn't require any special notifications, but I think signal's long notifications are giving it problems

		I have just been added to the Signal Desktop Beta and added my computer to Signal on my Android device. After scanning the QR-Code of my desktop I get a screen that asks me to accept that my Desktop can read my messages and post messages in my name. This screen uses a white background and light grey text and is very hard to read. I assume this is related to the dark theme, that I use and looks fine if you use the light/white theme. Probably you just need to adapt either background or text color for the dark theme.

		This is a duplicate of #4338 as this issue was already closed. See also maybe related issues I pointed out there. In short: If Signal already &quot;knows&quot; phone numbers of contacts, it doesn't resync with the phone contacts in case they're deleted or changed. I had for some reason multiple local phone contacts. To get rid of them, I deleted all my contacts from my phone and resynced them with DavDroid from my server. Since then Signal hasn't changed any of my contacts to add them as a Signal user. I'm running Signal 3.9.1 on Android 5.1.1 (CM 12.1) on a rooted device. It seems that Signal doesn't check the contacts anymore for already known numbers. Things I tried: Sync Signal via Settings -&gt; Accounts; refresh contacts in Signal itself. When I display only Signal contacts, none of the former Signal contacts are shown. In fact only my own contact shows up. I can also confirm that this happened on a non-rooted Samsung Galaxy S4 mini running Android 4.4 and Signal 3.9.1. There the contacts had been deleted and resynced with Google. The only &quot;solution&quot; which helped to add Signal users in contacts again was to reinstall the app.

		So, this is a messaging app and we all know that eventually you might send an image that is &quot;sensitive&quot;. I propose a flag be introduced to the image picker that would cause Signal on BOTH sides of the conversation mask the image until tapped. Tapping the image again would re-mask it. Implementation details could include a configuration option to always display images.

		Hi, Text message is not sent to the Signal users, if there is no internet connection, e.g. imagine if you are abroad and have no internet data roaming plan, I would expect Signal to send ordinary smsm messages to the Signal users. Sth like it works in iMessage: no internet, then send normal sms after a while. Now, if I am in roaming and Signal is default app for messaging, I cannot send any text messages to the people that have Signal app. How the app was designed to handle messages between people with Signal accounts when no internet connection?

		Hi Sometimes I encounter a strange behaviour: When I get a message, I enter my phones pin code to unlock it. Than I end up in the conversation with the contact that sent me the message and I can read most of the conversation. Only the message that just arrived is replaced with &quot;Encryption in progress&quot; (or something similar. In German it sais &quot;Entschlüsselung läuft. Bitte warten&quot;). I should add, that the Signal should be locked when this happens. It just did not ask for the password. When I close Signal and open it again, I'm prompted to enter the password and only then I can see the message that did arrive. At the moment I'm using the websocket fork of Signal, but I don't think this is caused by the fork. If you say it is, feel free to close this issue. For the record, the issue I opened in the forks repo can be found here: JavaJens#58 I'm on CopperheadOS based on AOSP and my phone has no GApps installed.

		Can you update your SSL certificate as it is very weak. I am not meaning the fact that it is not CA signed as you are using certificate pinning which is more secure.

		Make it possible to use Signal and register to a server without the need of a phone number. E.g. the idea would be to mirror what Threema is currently doing where you have an ID and you link either your phone number and/ or your e-mail address. Or nothing - you're still able to use the server without providing that data. But...it would make it easier for people to use Signal together if they, for example, only know each others e-mail. Is something like this on the roadmap? And if it isn't, can I put it there? :) Thanks for listening.

		I'm regularly outside of data zones but would still like to communicate with people. Especially when not it's an emergency. It's happened a couple of times now that Signal prevents me from sending a text when an update is required and I'm without access to the internet. This is pretty poorly thought out. It also just blocks the message from being sent - you only see the warning on the inbox list, rather than on the message list - without giving any indication why the message wasn't sent (when looking at the message thread). This is for ordinary messages to people who don't use Signal and thus don't have encrypted texts. Instead of preventing the message being sent, how about warning the user that their signal app is insecure every time they try updating the message.

		Hi, I factory reset my phone and installed Signal... and I reinstalled Signal multiple times now. The registration process is without problem... If I don't set Signal as the default SMS app, it shows no contacts whatsoever, allthough I resynced every possible account on the phone multiple times. If I set Signal as the default SMS app, it shows every contact twice (once from the google account and once from the whatsapp account, I think), allthough the rest of the phone handles identical entries without a problem. Also Contacts who write me still appear as phone numbers only and not in any way with a name, neither in groups nor in the chat overview nor in single chats. In either case: Groups where I am part of pop up when someone writes something in them, but they have cryptic names in popups (textsecure_group!1c20d...) and are named Unnamed Group inside the App. I can't reply in these groups, the keyboard dosn't even open. Also showing Group Members gives an empty Popup. This is by far not the first time I have Killer Issues with Textsecure/Signal (broken chats that can't be resolved, Contacts Syncing, allways broken Groups after reinstall (yes this is by far not the first time I'm having that issue, just the completely broken contacts are my main Issue right now)), Which saddens me because this is otherwise just an awesome Product and with Desktop support would replace 2 other messaging apps at once for me (of which I have about 5 at the moment). I seriously believe there are enough people that sent you debug logs and everything on similiar or the same issues, but if you need some I can provide them... with or without SMS enabled.

		I have installed signal in a secondary user profile (Android 5.1.1, Signal 3.9.1) and enabled signal as default SMS app, as well as enabled that profile to make calls and send sms.Signal is not installed for the primary user (phone owner). I verified that the system SMS app is receiving SMS fine, however, as soon as I switch to signal as the default SMS app, I no longer receive SMS on that profile. If I switch back to the primary user, the SMS is there. Unless I am missing something important, I don't see why signal should not be able to handle this case, e.g. if a user wants to use signal with a different Google account and/or sync contacts from a different source than the main account (my case). This is the log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6e8bb5eadfba96dbe8ba I get this, I assume that indicates an incoming SMS: W/SMSListener( 8759): Got SMS broadcast...
 however, signal does not act on it apparently, though I cannot see an obvious error message off-hand. Another log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ab72cc595bdb3212f106 This time, there is the following: W/SMSListener( 8759): Got SMS broadcast...
W/ResourceType( 8759): Found multiple library tables, ignoring...
 I have the feeling I saw the second message quite often in correlation with this when I tested it.

		Dear Madam or Sir, Unfortunately Signal contains a bug that makes it unusable for me. For me there are many situations in which a message is not received: -Not send due to missing online connection by myself -Not received due to missing online connection by receiver -Not received due to uninstalled Signal without un-registering the device of the receiver It would be more than helpful if Signal would notify me in these situations (e.g. after 30 seconds) so that I can decide to wait or to call/SMS the receiver. I’m aware that the one or two check marks show this information, but in practice people don’t pay attention to this detail and assume that the message was send. Best regards, MH2016s

			<description>
		Classic case of operator switch with mobile number transfer. When I'm trying to register it shows the number which was assigned to the sim card before my number was transferred. When I change it to the correct one I'm getting the verification SMS but the app shows: Connectivity error. Signal was unable to connect to the server. Some possible problems include: No network connectivity Restrictive firewall. Obviously I'm connected with both WiFi and 3G. Same happens when I'm only on WiFi and 3G.

		Sorry to post again. But I was wondering why you don't want to add an option to manually link devices? If you are too busy I can figure it out and create a pull request. I just don't want to go through the effort for it to be denied for unknown reasons. I imagine there are others with broken camera's that can't link their desktops. 👍 1

		I cannot use Signal-Android on tablets, I.e.the Pixel C. Assume that this is because of lack of cellular/SMS capabilities, but with the introduction of the desktop client it seems there is a way to do multi device setups supporting devices without a cellular modem/SMS capabilities.

		It would be nice to be able to long press the phone icon in a signal conversation to issue a 'normal' (i.e. unencrypted) call, just like it is currently possible to send an unencrypted SMS. As Signal calls for me still have a high latency/not very good voice quality I often find myself having to switch application from Signal to my contact list to be able to call my Signal-using contacts. Regarding the quality of calls, are you looking for additional servers/ressources in Europe (Switzerland for example)? Thanks a lot for this great application!

			<description>
		I've been using TextSecure/Signal for a while now and want to get more involved with the project. I figured adding fingerprint sensor app unlock support for the Android app would be a good first project. Before jumping into implementation, I found Issue #4439, where someone requested fingerprint app unlock as an alternative to passphrase, which was closed as wontfix. Was the reasoning for rejecting this feature request due to feature parity with iOS, placing trust in the OS's fingerprint store and authentication, privacy or security concerns, or software testing concerns? I'm not sure if the reasoning from Issue #420 significantly intrudes on the security levels I suggest below, especially when combined with exponential delays on failed attempts and database wipe after too many failed attempts within a period of time. This comes down to giving the user a choice of convenience and security, which I assume is why the no-passphrase option has not been removed yet. I was wondering if I implemented fingerprint app unlock if the Open Whisper team would be interested. Requiring both a passphrase and fingerprint is more secure than either one. In a public setting with wandering eyes, a fingerprint is more secure than a passphrase. Fingerprint sensor support would also allow quicker message checking while keeping Signal in a lock-after-5 minutes state. Here's what I was thinking of adding to the Settings menu always unlocked unlock with passphrase unlock with fingerprint or passphrase require passphrase every X hours (passphrase would be required after 3 fingerprint unlock attempts, and after any device reboot) unlock with passphrase and fingerprint (requires both to unlock the phone every time it is locked) erase all conversation history after Y failed unlock attempts (any combination of fingerprint and passphrase) Signal would use the Android Fingerprint API, using whatever fingers are registered with the OS.

		Because I use signal as my default sms app, sometimes I need to send my signal contacts multiple sms and I don't want to long press the sending button every time I need to send one. I would suggest to put a additional entry in the contact settings. Examples: If they on vacation and disable there mobile data. Or if they lost there phone and need to use there old nokia until they get a new one.

		When tapping into a conversation, the cursor in the typing area matches the pretty signal blue for both secure and normal SMS contacts. I think it'd be a nice touch to have the cursor color match the contact's color. I know this wouldn't be a high priority issue at all but it would be low-hanging fruit for someone who does android programming and wanted to start getting involved with signal development.

		I cannot reply to a contact who joined Signal yesterday using Signal-Android. I can receive encrypted messages just fine, but Signal-Android does not find the user on the server: The input bar reads &quot;Send unsecured SMS&quot; and there is no option to reset the encrypted connection. A lock is shown next to the messages I received from the contact, and the messages sync correctly to Signal-Desktop, so the encrypted connection seems functional. It seems that the registration is a bit mucked up, though. When I try to reply with Signal-Desktop, I get the following lines in the log: PUT https://textsecure-service-ca.whispersystems.org:4433/v1/messages/+[REDACTED]838
PUT https://textsecure-service-ca.whispersystems.org:4433/v1/messages/+[REDACTED]838 404 Error

		Signal 3.9.1 When I have no unread signal messages and I receive a message, I will get a notification which contains the sender's name and the message. When I have unread signal messages and I receive a message from a different contact, I will get a notification which shows &quot;Most recent from: &quot; and does not contain the text of the most recent message. Maybe this bothers me more than others due to my use case, but as I use a pebble which receives the text of notifications, this means that whenever I receive a message and I have another unread message, I will not be able to see the text of the newest message on my pebble. It will only receive the text of the new &quot;Most recent from &quot; message. I'd like for there to be a notification setting to turn off this &quot;summary&quot; notification.

		I've run into a weird little issue : my phone's LED indicator is not working as part of &quot;new message&quot; notifications. The sound and the vibration do work, but the LED does not, which results in very poor usability : since without the blinking LED, having missed the initial sounds and vibrations, there is then no way to tell, by just looking at the phone, whether or not there are new messages except by unlocking the screen - so in order to not miss messages one has to constantly unlock the screen and check for a notification in the status bar. The LED used to work fine with text messages prior to the installation of Signal. It still works correctly with WhatsApp. Signal seems to be the only app where the LED is malfunctioning. Here's my debug log : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a4338e57a0ee8ddfc0a3 . I submitted this issue as a support request (ID 1667) back on December 13, but have since despaired of getting any reply and so decided to create an issue here.

		Often time I have to open the app for Signal to poll new messages. Basically the app do not fetch for days and it is only when you manually open the app that it actually fetch all the messages. It happens on many devices, actually many android devices of my relatives. It happens more often with miui/xiaomi devices which is known to often kill background services for performances purposes. It happens since months and I thought it would be a common bug. Other app do get notifications.

		Dear Whispter Systems, first of all I would like to express my HUGE appreciation for your product !!! I have been testing a LOT of apps and your is by FAR the best out there !!! I absolutely admire the CRYSTAL CLEAR call quality, it is really outstanding! Although your app is almost perfect, I would kindly like to ask you to take a look at one issue, which troubles me and if this gets fixed, I would pronounce your product as PERFECT !!! When speaking on Signal, if somebody tries to call me by phone, he simply gets a voice message that I am unable to take his call and I just get an entry in the missed calls list. This is not OK, as I need to call back that person. I would like to be informed about incoming calls and have the possibility to pause or drop the Signal call and to take the normal phone call. Please kindly make it the default behaviour or provide an option that would enable this behaviour. Many thanks !!

		Hi, since the last update I've found a problem with the signal app. When I receive messages, they appear in the notification bar on top of the phone but they don't show up in the main windows of the app, neither do they show up when I directly press &quot;reply&quot; from the notification bar. The problem occurs only after the latest update to 3.10. I already uninstalled and reinstalled signal - same issue. I confirmed that it is not a problem of the sending phone; that works fine with other contacts. Device: Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Android: 4.4 Debug log: debug log Signal is standard SMS app. Steps to reproduce: send message to the phone. Any help possible there?

		In certain circumstances, messages are sent but not from within the signal app. For example, when you decline a call with a message or send bulk messages with other apps. Signal only checks the local message database on first install, and messages that appear there later are ignored. If I decline a call with a message, it appears in the stock messaging app, but not in signal. Not sure if this is a feature request or a bug fix, but signal should show non-native outgoing messages, and also display delivered status.

			<description>
		The graphical symbol (pencil) of the floating action button in the conversation list doesn't make much sense. A pencil usually represents writing. But tapping that floating action button opens Signal's contact list (and is btw currently the only way to achieve that), which is not very intuitive. &quot;Writing&quot; in that context could be interpreted as e. g. a) writing a new message within an existing conversation (i. e. in the conversation list) or b) starting a new conversation (i. e. in the contact list). One the other hand, a plus sign (&quot;+&quot;) represents adding, like in adding a new conversation. Within the context of the conversation list, I'm not aware of any other imaginable interpretations, so a plus sign is not ambiguous regarding its purpose. So in conclusion, I suggest that the pencil symbol is replaced by a plus sign. An alternative possibility would be using that &quot;contacts&quot; symbol pictured below (after all, tapping the button opens Signal's contact list). CC: @agrajaghh 👍 1

		Hi, I've searched for references to PIN in existing issues and was unable to find any existing references. If there is one, I apologise in advance but I wasn't able to locate any. I use the passphrase option to lock the app (privacy settings) and love the feature but would like it if there was an alternative option to have it as a passcode/PIN instead of a passphrase. Keep the passphrase for first use after a restart of the phone and for encryption, etc. but for inactivity timeout a PIN entry in the same style as Nine (email client) and Telegram would be awesome. Where you set a PIN. It provides the buttons so that keyboard isn't required (handy especially if keyboard is recording strokes for autocorrect, etc.) and no need to press &quot;return/enter&quot; - it just unlocks if correct PIN is entered.

		I just installed the latest Signal (3.9.1), and installed it on GFs phone as well. Then I text her and she didn't get my text until she turned her data on the next day. This used to work so well, especially in our country where mobile data is finite and very expensive and where we may not want to have our data enabled for fear of further tracking/random apps eating your cap. Sending messages over data is great and all I understand the metadata security implications of SMS but surely it is better to send metadata in the clear, and the message encrypted, than sending both in the clear? Seemed like a great way to backport encryption to older technologies. The other great thing about the app was that you could replace the shitty stock SMS apps that come with smartphones with this beautiful application and get encryption to people who have the same app, over data or SMS. I read over issue #2847 and they seemed to completely discount this whole user base and the above use cases... pretty sad. I don't want to have to go back to the shitty stock SMS app :(

		I am using signal on Android as sms app. As the database for the sms gets encrypted I can't seem to find a way to count my monthly used sms. Would it be possible to implement an sms counter into signal or somehow let another app to count the number of outgoing sms? This would be helpful for users with a monthly amount of prepaid sms.

		The recent commit 25d7931 uses the string &quot;Signal system database import is complete.&quot; (I am aware that @haffenloher just made the already existing string translatable and replaced &quot;TextSecure&quot; with &quot;Signal&quot; - so not pointing fingers). &quot;Signal system database&quot; doesn't make any sense to me, i. e. having &quot;Signal&quot; and &quot;system&quot; in the same expression imho contradicts itself. There are a) Signal's (encrypted) database and b) Android's central database for SMS/MMS, which is used by other messaging apps. What this string means to describe is the process of importing from (b) to (a), i. e. from the system database to Signal's database. So this really should read &quot;System database import is complete.&quot;, correct? While I'm at it, I'd rather suggest &quot;Import of the system's SMS/MMS database has been completed.&quot; (this assumes that this string is the text body of a dialog - more space for more detailed info available - while &quot;Import complete&quot; is the dialog's title) or &quot;Import of system database completed.&quot; if something shorter is needed.

		Non-international phone number are not supported (contact does not appears during a search) A mobile phone number can appear in multiple way here: +54 9 (area) (number) 0054 9 (area) (number) (area) 15 (number) (if inside Argentina, whatever the caller area code is) 15 (number) [if both numbers share the same area] Where &quot;9&quot; is the magic number for mobile (equivalent to the local &quot;15) and &quot;1&quot; for land-lines &quot;15&quot; is the magic number for mobile (number) contains 6 to 8 digits (area) can (optionally?) be prefixed by a trunk code of value &quot;0&quot;, eg: 223 == 0223, or 11 == 011 (don't know about the cases of the trunk code being mandatory) The area is somehow part of the number (since the number is registered for a unique and given area). But it can be omitted if calling from a device from the same area (similarly to the country code 54 which can be omitted if we call from a national device) Most contact's phone numbers are registered using the 4th scheme excepting contacts from other regions. The Android API already provides the country code. From this, it may be possible to know the area code (depending on the Android API?) From the above two it should be fairly easy to map phones number from one scheme to another. I don't know if heavy modifications are needed, but I could at least provide a PR to add test case. https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/test/unitTest/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/PhoneNumberFormatterTest.java ? [edit] It seems that most of the country-specific logic should be handled by the libphonenumber, and more specifically https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/libphonenumber/test/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/data/PhoneNumberMetadataProtoForTesting_AR If it turns to be true, then what keeps the different notation to be understand as a unique contact?

Different options could be considered: a) extend the &quot;all images&quot; view to allow selecting and storing all pictures at once. b) an option to automatically store all incoming pictures in a folder on the sd-card. I'm sure other options might be perceivable. Thanks for your consideration.

However, especially with those contacts, the extended info &quot;send time&quot; and &quot;delivered time&quot; per message were very helpful. (The wording might be different; I use the German version.) They were only displayed for sent messages, not for recieved, and I was rather looking forward to get them on both. Anyhow, now I don't even get the &quot;delivered&quot; info for sent messages anymore. Is this a server issue/feature/bug? Because I do not recall a Signal update since it still worked.

		Hello, please apologize if my post is not appropriate here. I like Signal very much, I have installed it on both of my Phones - a Samsung phone on Android and on my iPhone. And I am really puzzled by the big differences in the app on both OS. I could even say that it almost looks like a different app. Here I would like to accent on 2 things: Some time ago, I had raised a question, that while speaking on Signal on my Android phone, it is not possible to put the Signal call on hold, in order to take the phone call. I have got an answer, that it is not possible. On my iPhone though, I was surprised, that this works! I was speaking on Signal, I received a phone call and I was able to take the phone call !! Security settings - I was pleased with the many security features offered on Android - it is possible to set a PIN code in order to access the app. I was also delighted about the option to set a number of messages to be kept, which I have set very low, so all the old messages simply go to /dev/zero Both these options are not available on iOS :-/ Even when I enter the settings, they look almost empty, compared to the numerous settings and options on Android... Can you please shortly comment on why it is like that ? Just asking out of curiosity... I hope that the app will further evolve on both platforms and will provide even more features! Thank you for providing this magnificent software for free!! I wish you all the best for the future!

Sadly voice calls only partially working. I can call other Signal users but they can't hear my voice. I'm getting a lot of sendto() failed! errors in /dev/log/main. After some further debugging I found that sendto() always fails with error 22 (EINVAL - invalid argument). As far as I understand the code the socket is already connected in RtpSocket.java so a send() should be enough in RtpAudioSender.cpp. I changed sendto() to send() and got voice calls working. I'm not sure if this is a BlackBerry specific issue cause it works with sendto() on pretty any Android device. Steps to reproduce Install Signal on a BlackBerry Install Cobalt's Google Apps follow the instructions on Cobalt's official Google Apps landing page.

		Bug description I've had to reinstall my phone (oneplus2), and I've used titanium backup to conduct that operation. Once the phone was operational again, I restored my apps (including signal) using titanium. Upon reinstallation, signal sent me 200+ 'so and so is on signal' messages, as one would expect to receive when someone joins - except this was for everyone in my phonebook that has signal installed. When I mark the messages read, it pushes them down to me again so that they are 'new'. When I try to delete them, it pushes them to me again. The only thing i can do is sit here with several hundred new, unread messages. I've attempted to uninstall and completely delete all traces of signal from my phone, as well as removing the desktop application to 'start from scratch', but nothing I do seems to tell the server side that it should stop sending me this tidalwave of welcome messages. Steps to reproduce install signal send a few messages make a backup of signal using titanium backup format phone / factory reset re-root, install old rom (i'm using stock oneplus2 roms) install titanium backup restore apps, or even just signal by itself resulting scenario is signal re-pushing welcome messages to you forever.

		I would like to present one of our use cases for Signal (on Android): We use the app for sensitive information exchange, but would not only like the communication safe on the communication channel side, but also protected from people having access to our phones. Therefore we have set a password and set the inactivity time out to a low value. Often in a rush you might not be able to lock and close Signal and thus this is done automatically within a minute in our case. There are situations in reality where other people temporarily have access to your phone and therefore locking the app is very important ... Now we would find it very useful additional to the automatic lock after inactivity we could also set an option to automatically close Signal. In theory Signal offers everything to achieve what we need to be sufficiently secure, if there was not bug 3172, which leaves a screenshot in the recent app overview of your communication in some cases on Android &gt;5, which happens regularly to us. An autoclose feature would also work around that problem, as the app is automatically closed after a set time out if we forget to close it. Automatically closing is very sensible from our point of view as it exactly does what automatically locking does: Making sure as much information as possible stays private ... an open signal windows in the recent apps overview is some tiny bit of information we would like to avoid automatically by setting a timeout. Of course if sensitive information exchange happens the user should be sensible enough to make sure he locks and closes the app, but in reality all of us are human and there are situations where auto locking and auto closing saves you a lot of trouble. I think this also fits well with idea of signal being as simple as possible to use. I agree technology can not compensate stupidity of people, but that's not what I am requesting. Furthermore it would compensate bug 3172 really well, as this would not have to rely on the ROM following the rules.

		Hi All, I was thinking that it would be cool to have a popup keyboard that opens in the app only. This would not be a keyboard app for android, really just a series of buttons that are displayed in the app that would allow the user to type &quot;seriously secure content&quot; without being tracked. I know that we could find a keyboard that &quot;doesn't track anything&quot; but it seems much more secure to have a internal keyboard that isn't a keyboard at all. Even if they say they don't track, you can't really be sure, plus, for most of my other activities, I enjoy the auto-correct and predictiveness of Google. Even most of my messages, I don't really have an issue with Google storing the data they store. But if I did want to send something I was worried about Google seeing, having a quick button I could click to open up a keyboard to enter a quick message would be amazing. Websites have done this for years, typically older government sites. They would have a little popup keyboard that you would use your mouse to select they keys to ensure a keylogger wasn't recording your social security number. Seems like a good idea to me, what do you think?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates What about implementing in (distant) future versions p2p-like capabilities when it comes to phone calls, with the central server working as a simple switchboard operator? That would be even more secure and would save bandwidth as well as open possibilities to higher quality calls. The same could work with pictures/audios/videos, with the server taking them on board only if the other party isn't online.

Messages do arrive, but only when the app is opened.

		Since the verification of other peoples keys is very important, I propose adding a visual indicator to the contact display. Something like a badge, or a star or lock symbol. This indicator will be displayed after the user explicitely stated that he had verified the contacts key. This is helpful in keeping track of the contact verification status and also would encourage new users to understand that verifiyng keys is important. Beste regards Henning

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I am not sure if this is a vulnerability, if it's a bug or a &quot;feature&quot;. When using Signal as a default SMS app and enable the locked option, as far as I know, no one should be able to access any received message. However, if you have any two factor-authentication enable on Google (using Google as an example) and try to login to your Google account, you will receive an SMS and Google will automatically read the SMS and authenticate you, without any need of manually having to unlock Signal, copy the authentication code and paste it to Google's prompt. This should probably work with any app that will automatically read any SMS received to authenticate any 2 second-authentication code. This concerns me, because if I have any type of malware listening to my SMS app, it will be able to read any message I receive without worrying if Signal is locked or not. Steps to reproduce Remove your Google account from your Android settings. Make sure Signal is locked and is your default SMS app. Login to your Google Account. Wait for the SMS. Google will automatically authenticate you. Device info Samsung Galaxy S5 running Cyanogen lastest nightly build of KLTE. ** Signal Version: 3.13.1

Instead I just get &quot;Recipient has no identity key&quot;. I also cannot view the key of the other person, while my key is synced to the other device.

		If the USERTRUST RSA ssl cert Signal uses is disabled in Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Trusted Certificated, Signal correctly fails to register. However, the message is a generic server connection failure... Technically correct, practically not very helpful. To be honest, I recently disabled all the certs on my phone and started running apps one by one and approving only what needs approving. So far, not a single app did too well in these regards. A few even failed silently... Regardless, even if it's not worth improving on, I figured I should at least put it out there just in case someone runs into some obscure but related issues. I also saw the last few commits touched some elliptic curve cipher related stuff so this might actually be useful one day ;)

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates Description My goal is to verify that the APK distributed on Google Play is executing the code at the commit of the release tag on GitHub. Even though I trust OWS to publish the untampered code, they could be compelled to alter it without revealing it, and it is better to know than to assume. To do the verification, I'm looking at the hash of each file in the APK I get from Google Play and comparing it with the hash of the APK I built myself. In build.gradle a timestamp is populated as a BuildConfig field at build time. This field has millisecond accuracy and is used to expire the binary after 90 days. Due to it changing during every build, classes.dex in the APK has a different hash, so it's impossible to verify the integrity of the code. Proposal I'd like to submit a PR to: change the timestamp to be granular only to the day (1458190800000ms). be replaceable by an environment or system variable. This would allow for easy APK verification. The signing date of the Play APK can be used to determine the build date which can then be replaced during a verification build. The timestamp can still be used to determine when 90 days have gone by and a build has expired. Risks The risk of this feature regressing in the future is fairly high due to the external nature of the verification. This could be mitigated by a build step that performs the verification, or reduced through good commenting. The code I'm using for verification is available here. Signal version: 3.14.1, and master at time of filing. 👍 2

		I have: [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Android apps can choose whether their links open a new tab or overwrite any previous tab the app had opened. Signal should so the former, but does the latter. For example, if a friend sends a link to a newspaper article about how awesome end to end encryption is, and then while I'm reading it I get a message from a restaurant asking me to click a link to confirm my reservation, doing so will overwrite the tab where I was reading the article, requiring me to go back to that conversation, click it again, and then find my place again. This is annoying, and sometimes hard to anticipate (who remembers how they opened a tab four hours ago?) Steps to reproduce click a link in a message you received use the app switcher button to switch back to signal click a different link in a message you received Device info Model: Google/LG Nexus 5X Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.14.2 Solution You need to set EXTRA_CREATE_NEW_TAB. see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Browser.html#EXTRA_CREATE_NEW_TAB for details. I guess if some people find the current behavior preferable, this could be a configuration option, though I really think this is almost always unexpected behavior. I could send a pull request, but: I don't have an appropriate dev environment set up, and so would have to do so without testing, which makes me nervous. I can't actually find where Signal is calling out to the browser.

I'm using TS/Signal for many years now and my chats are constantly growing. Meanwhile it is nearly impossible to find Information within the chats manually by scrolling up/down (not heaving a scroll-handle like e.g. in the contacts-app makes this even worse). This is different from a search because a search will need more UI-changes (e.g. search next/prev buttons), a filter will only need a small text-box and will just narrow down the messages of the current chat-list. It would be great to jump into the unfiltered chat to the position of the selected message from the filtered list. Device info Model: OnePlus One (Bacon) Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.14.2

		An additional option for default message type (Signal, Insecure SMS) in contact settings would be really helpful. There are cases, when someone is using this app as main SMS application along with chat member but sometimes we don't want to use secure connection for specified amount of time (battery drain problems, roaming and other reasons).

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Enhancement description There are many sharing options in Signal, including sending of images and videos taken from camera or audio files, recorded by another application, but there is no convenient way to send and receive (play in-app) audio recordings, recorded only with the microphone. This is a very useful feature in bad connectivity or harsh audio environments, where live audio call is not an option (a very notable case being a warzone or aftermath of a natural disaster). There are also many markets such as Spain where people use this function on a daily basis. If the description is not evident enough, try to think of it as a &quot;software walkie talkie&quot;, which allows the first Signal user to only press a button in the application (like &quot;push-to-talk&quot; button on a walkie talkie) and it starts recording the audio, which is then compressed with a suitable speech codec and sent via Signal to the receiving user. In this way the talk is not real-time, but it allows for disturbances in the connectivity between the two users and it also allows the second user to listen to the message repeatedly in case of loud audio environment on any side of the conversation. ps: Maybe TextSecure-Server would be a better repository to post this enhancement to, but it doesn't seem too live, and I haven't been able to found the Signal-Server one... If it's necessary, I'll repost this elsewhere, just let me know where.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Since I do not have a phone carrier plan, I use signal to send and receive messages over Wifi connections. This works because I have a VoIP provider with which I was able to go through the voice-based registration procedure (and thank you so much for that!). However, to send and receive SMS messages, I use a different app, which works pretty well. In fact, during the registration process, I did receive the SMS confirmation message - i just wasn't able to use it because Signal didn't intercept it. But that's fine as well because I could work around the problem. My main concern at this point is that I need to consciously switch between my SMS and Signal apps, based on whether or not I know that the user has Signal at all. In fact, I think there's a usability issue there, even for regular user: if Signal has trouble sending SMS messages (e.g. problem with the SIM card, connectivity issues), how does it tell the user? From my point of view here, Signal tries to send the message and I get the &quot;bouncing 3 dots&quot; forever, even though there's no SIM card on the phone and this will never succeed. What I would like would be for Signal to be able to talk to other apps to send and receive insecure SMS messages. I am not sure i clearly understand how the insecure fallback works right now - it doesn't feel like Signal uses the builtin messaging app but talks to the SMS subsystem of Android on itself. Could it be possible to fallback to some other SMS provider? I guess this also applies to competing protocols like Whatsapp or Telegram: what if my contact is not using signal? Could I still use Signal as a unified messaging app? (and coincidentally invite my poor Whatsapp or Telegram user to join Signal!) Note that other apps would need support for such process, of course. I have opened an issue for my specific app (michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client#55) but I guess there would need to be such systems in place for this to work with Telegram or Whatsapp or whatever... Finally, I understand if you close my feature request as out of scope, but please do consider at least the case where the sim card is misplaced, removed, or the phone is in airplane mode. Usability could be improved at that level. At least having a timeout (or a shorter one, if there is one already) would improve the situation here. Steps to reproduce remove your SIM card register a SIP account with SMS support (e.g. at https://voip.ms/) install an app to manage SMS in Android (e.g. https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client) try to send an insecure message in Signal Actual result: the message never gets sent and gets stuck in the &quot;bouncing 3 dots&quot; state forever (or at least, I have a few messages stuck in that state since saturday, so 48h+) Expected result: detect there is no SIM card and fail, or offer some configuration option to send messages through another messaging app Screenshots The above screenshot shows Signal functioning normally for secure messages, but shows the last message stuck in the &quot;three bouncing dots&quot; state for 3 minutes. Earlier in the history, there are two more messages stuck in that state from saturday (not shown in screenshot).

		Bug description Last week I was travelling. Prior to my trip I had asked a question on the Signal site about migrating my session to my old phone (which would not matter too much if it were lost or stolen). The response I got was: You can install Signal on your other phone.  Any new
installation of Signal will generate new keys.
 However, it doesn't seem to be as simple as this. Steps to reproduce This explains my pre-travel actions: Install signal for android on phone1. Use signal for a while. Partake in private and group messages. Remove sim card from phone1 and install in phone2. Install signal on phone2. At this point, I am on the road with phone2. If you message people, they are informed that my keys have changed, which is fine. However, if other people post in a group chat that you were involved in on phone1, then the group is named Unnamed group on phone2 and the message entry box is un-tappable. You see messages come in, but you are unable to send messages. Then I returned home, and replaced the sim card into phone1. Now I cannot message anyone. The messages have a red message next to them saying Failed to send and Tap for details. When you tap, you see ( i ) Some issues need your attention and Failed to send. There is are-send` button, but it doesn't help in this case. Expected Outcome Signal should work on multiple devices per account (and it would be nice if it worked on tablets too). I think the issues I outline are because each user is expected to have exactly one keypair. This would be fine if there were a way to share a keypair between more than one device, or if Signal allowed one account to have multiple key-pairs. Maybe this design decision relates to the fact that a phone number can be active in only one device at a time? I also note that signal still works on phone1 which has no SIM card inserted. Not sure if that is desired behaviour(?). I'm not sure what I should do to get signal working again, please advise. Thanks

		Setting the trusted state have to be done by the user, at the moment every message is checked of in chat without the user can even know, if he can trust this fingerprint.... Else simply checking if the fingerprints are the same isn't enough! The way how it's implemented yet is practically unusable. If the fingerprint is altered by a man in the middle you wouldn't know until you check it again... So doing it like in OTR: Saving each fingerprint and display its trusted state in Chat will be more appropriate in the meaning of feeling secure...

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description A contact which I have previously been communicating with via the secure data channel has suddenly only become able to send via SMS, however messages (and voice calls) from this contact continue to be received via the data channel. It appears that my device has decided that the remote user is no longer using Signal. Unfortunately I was unable to capture a debug log when the changeover occurred. (27 hours ago) Looking back through the conversation it appears that a message failed to deliver, and all further messages fell back to the SMS transport. I have had the remote user restart the secure session, which has no impact. The only debug step I have not taken is to delete the conversation and attempt to restart it. I would prefer not to do this and lose the conversation history if possible. Steps to reproduce Attempt to send user a message Actual result: Message delivered via SMS (If message sent from desktop app a &quot;Message not sent&quot; error appears.) Expected result: Message delivered via data channel. Attempt to reset secure session using menu in conversation. Actual result: &quot;Invite&quot; menu option is available. Expected result: &quot;Reset secure session&quot; menu option is available. Attempt to call user Actual result: Call is made using standard dialer app Expected result: Secure call is initiated. Attempt to reset secure session via desktop app Actual result: &quot;Message not sent&quot; alert appears. Re-sending causes same error. Expected result: Secure session reset successfully.

		I love Signal, and have used it for some time and gotten several friends to start using it. But recently I switched my Motorola Nexus 6 to (AOSP-based) CyanogenMod 13.0.1 (Android 6.0.1 r17), and I don't want to install any Google-compiled proprietary software on it. I see that when I try to install a Signal 3.15.2 .apk from APK Mirror, it does install, and starts. But when I get to the first screen, &quot;Connect with Signal&quot; where it is asking me for verification of my phone number so that it can register me, and I press the &quot;Register&quot; button, it then pops up a white message box saying, &quot;Get Google Play services -- Signal won't run without Google Play services, which are missing from your phone.&quot; And gives me a link (which doesn't work -- no doubt to the Google Play Store) to &quot;GET GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES&quot;. Might it be possible to have a version of Signal without this dependency on having Google Play services installed? Thanks!

		Ever since I installed Android M on my Moto G3 I've had problems not filling my internal memory by accident, because Play Music now refuses to put my music on my SD-card. Ordinarily I can handle this quite well, with one exception.. Signal keeps using all the internal space, because everytime I send a video the app creates a duplicate of the file *_inside *_of Signal and I can't help but ask: Why? Why would I ever need a copy of my video inside of Signal? If you send a video you already have it on your phone, so why make another copy? The obvious explanation is that that way you know which video you sent, but really, can't you just add a file name instead? I think this behavior would be fine if I could put Signal on my SD-card, or if Signal could somehow only save transferred files on the SD-card, but in a world where internal space is scarce I think this is a really stupid design decision. Yes, I know about the feature that trims conversations and yes I know I can just delete the video from Signal after sending the file. But come on guys, that shouldn't be necessary!

Nine out of ten times, I'll immediately close the keyboard. At the same time, I understand that this behavior has its purpose. So in order to make everybody happy, I suggest a small (but quite elegant imho) change that additionally is completely in line with Android's (i. e. Marshmallow's) own behavior regarding e. g. the All Apps button (the button that opens Android's app drawer): Tapping the Compose (i. e. pencil) button opens the contact list (but not the keyboard), Long-pressing the Compose button opens the contact list AND the keyboard. Ok, that's it. My suggestion.

		Please see and re-open or merge in #5186. I have been struggling with the exact same problem for about two months. I do not have MoboClean installed on my phone. This has happened with two contacts so far and nothing I can do on my end will fix the issue. Symptoms are they send to me via encrypted signal over IP. My outbound to them shows sms as my only choice and I have the &quot;Invite&quot; item in my menu. I use signal as my only messenger for sms or signal contacts.

		There were a lot of cases for this already. After looking through conversations, it seems that each of them references others as duplicates and so all of them are considered closed =). I have a person in my contact list, who is mostly offline but this person is Signal user. I am also Signal user ans I also often get offline. When I send message to this person, it stays undelivered for hours. In case when it is urgent but not confidential at all, I want to have an ability to send it as SMS explicitly. I can just use built-in SMS application to send and receive SMS (as I am going to do now), but it is more comfortable and safe to use Signal here too. So the only wish is to let me decide when talking to Signal users, what exactly I want to send: Signal message, or SMS. Finally, until Signal allows to select between its messages and SMS, replacing stock SMS app with Signal just looks confusing because of above reasons.

		I would like to have Signal display read notifications to contacts that I choose. I have read the lengthy discussion in #957 about read receipts but since this is over 2 years old, I would like to reopen the discussion. From my point of view, having a feature that transmits information (like when a message was read) in an app that is about communication (i.e. the transmission of information) is a good thing. Whether to make this feature on/off by default or opt-in/opt-out is obviously debatable. My personal opinion is that I'd probably like it to be opt-out on a per contact basis, but to not change the current behavior for people from how it currently is, it would probably be more sensible to have Signal ask the question once per contact (when you start a new conversation) unless a default setting is set in the settings section. Even if the feature is delivered as off by default and has to be manually enabled, it would be a big improvement over the status-quo. Because (and I cannot stress this enough after reading through the discussion in #957) having a minority restrict the choices of a majority is the opposite of freedom and democracy and it seems to me these are among the most important things that free secure messaging is trying to protect.

When I try sending a private message, it defaults to SMS. However, he is able to send me private messages, so clearly his client recognises my number as a signal contact.

		Android 6.0.1, Nexus-5, Signal version 3.15.2. I have a few contacts (maybe 5% of all my Signal partners) where I am able to send encrypted messages to, but this lock sign next to the earphone symbol is missing, indicating unsecure/unencrypted/regular calls only. The phone number syntax is the same across all contacts, removing the account and refreshing things does not help (for testing purposes I tried new, different phone number layouts, prefix vs. +-sign etc. etc., with no improvement). The funny thing is that with those 5% the other contacts do see this lock sign with my contact, and they can successfully inititate Redphone calls to me. It is just my side which cannot initiate encrypted calls. So what is wrong with this 5% of my Signal contacts? Any help is welcome, Kind regards, mistersixt.

Implement an option to use an offline mesh message network like e.g. firechat. firechat and the like use the phones Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas to transmit messages, calls and files without connection to cell towers or Wi-Fi. if more people are using it, it can relay messages through other users to the recipient (less server load). it could be nice if signal could send messages like: is local mesh-network available? yes: use no: ↓ is signal message possible? ues: use, no ↓ use sms. Why usercase1: privacy This will give great privacy reassurance. if you are within range to use a local mesh-network you can communicate &quot;offline&quot; with less chance of mass surveillance. Firechat was used for this reason during the umbrella revolution in Hong Kong for democracy and free speach. usercase2: travel/mass gatherings If you are travelling (to a country where you don't have a mobile plan or in a place without coverage (plane or underground train)) you can use local mesh-network messaging to contact people and to find people in the crowd of a festival etc. This would give great convenience, privacy, communication redundancy and save on you money on your mobile plan.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports For some reason, all messages delivered through Signal are slow to deliver. I say this based on the checkmark (sent/delivered) indicator, but also based on manually talking to a contact to figure out when things came through. I find that when this happens, asking the other person to send me a Signal message will force all undelivered messages to go through. In this case, calling through Signal doesn't work - it's just stuck at dialing forever (although it's possible, though unlikely, that I just didn't wait long enough). However, once pending messages are &quot;flushed&quot;, calling starts working again. This happens both on Signal Android and a linked Signal Desktop. I've also seen it happen when contacting contacts on both Android and iOS. At least one of the contacts I've seen this with has been on Signal for months, and at least one contact I've seen this with had literally just installed and registered. When this doesn't happen, I find that messages will sometimes take a couple seconds to go through, but before I started running into this issue (which was a week or two ago), messages would generally go through almost instantly. All contacts that I'm sending messages to are in the same geographic area, so in theory we should all be contacting the same server region (in case there servers run in e.g. multiple AWS regions). Device info Device: Nexus 6P Android version: CyanogenMod 13.0-20160604-NIGHTLY-angler, based on Android 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.16.0, installed via the Google Play Store gapps was installed via the OpenGApps nano package. I'm on Play Store 6.5.08.D-all [0] 2792142, Google Play Services 9.0.83 (440-121911109). The problem seems to occur regardless of whether or not I'm on a WiFi network. I called my contact over the cell network - he was on WiFi while I was seeing the issue, and said that both my test messages went through when he disconnected (although I only saw a delivery receipt on one of them - possibly a different bug).

		This is a credibility issue. I try to get everyone to use Signal, but twice in a row now when I try to get Android users (i have iOS) to do it, they are fine until Signal requires access to everything. Then I look like a liar, a dummy, or both. For example, why does Signal need access to the calendar? Just because it's open source isn't enough for many people to trust it if their phone tells them it wants to see everything. Is there a way to let users opt out of some features so they can decide what the appropriate level of access is?

		Changing phone number after verifying old phone number can lead to interesting stuff if provider decides to reuse old phone number. NOTE: This might not be an issue with app or might not be an issue at all but something to keep in mind, or maybe it is known (quick google returned nothing similar). Or maybe something can be done with protocol or by making app verify SIM_card/phone_number did not change. No idea. Just putting this here. Steps to reproduce Register and verify current phone number with signal. Change phone number. (get new sim card in my case). 2.1. Forget to register and verify your new phone number with signal (because it still works! I still get messages from my signal contacts...). Get old phone number blocked and reused by provider. (someone else now has your old phone number) (I think this could be easily reproduced without providers reusing your phone number and just putting sim card into some other phone) (TO RESEARCH: what would happen if new owner of my old phone number also registered that phone number with signal? Would I receive his/her messages assuming I did not change my signal phone number?) Actual result: Other people can still send SMS to you by using your old phone number while using signal. Using not_signal to send messages sends them to person who now has your old phone number. Calling them via signal (icon was of not encrypted call) calls new owner of your old phone number (awkward conversation...). Expected result: No idea. Check if user has not changed their phone number to prevent such fun incidents?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I can't send a regular SMS to a contact with whom I normally use Signal. This is sometimes necessary if a contact exhausted their data plan for example. The only workaround I've found is to make the regular SMS app the default app, send the message, then set the default back to Signal. Steps to reproduce Make sure Signal is the default app for SMS Look up the contact in the address book Click in the message icon next to the number Compose a message Actual result: Message is sent through the Signal protocok, and there is no way to change that behaviour. The contact doesn't get it if they don't have an internet connection on their device Expected result: There would be a way to switch temporarily to regular messages for the contact. Not sure of the exact optimal behaviour in terms of UX, but it should be technically possible to send an SMS.

		Bug description I used to have Signal for Android which I loved. However I got an ubuntu phone which doesn't have signal. My friend got a new phone and I recommended that they get signal. They sent me a message (which was an encrypted one as it detected my cell number) which I never received. I presume this is because Signal is trying to deliver an encrypted message to me which I can't receive. Ideally Signal would detect that I no longer use the app and can't receive encrypted messages, and should deliver a normal SMS instead. Steps to reproduce use signal stop using signal someone who still uses signal sends you a message Actual result: you never receive the sent message. Expected result: signal defaults to SMS (or asks sender if they're okay downgrading to SMS) once it realises you're no longer using the app and can't receive encrypted messages.

		I think it should be made more clear that SMS is possible with signal contacts, as it's not immediately obvious that you have to hold down the send button. There are a few annoying edge-cases that come up when a user doesn't have an internet connection. One, is that signal doesn't &quot;remember&quot; that it's sending a message. If you consider another platform like WhatsApp, if there isn't an internet connection, the app keeps trying to send it until it succeeds. With signal, if a user sends a message and forgets about it, it won't be sent even when an internet connection becomes available again. Another solution is to transition to SMS when there isn't a connection. Obviously a seamless transition brings forth security concerns, but a warning message alerting the user that a connection isn't available and then asking if they'd like to send an insecure SMS message instead could work. The app would display the messages differently and ask again after n minutes.

		Telegram has recently been involved in a government-led hack that exposed many of their Iranian customers: https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/08/03/telegram-apps-sms-activation-used-to-expose-activists-and-journalists/ The problem is that the carrier intercepted the activation SMS and set up new devices for one's account. Signal seems to have the same vulnerability, maybe worse, since there doesn't seem to be a way to add a password to an account (which Telegram has). There should be a way to better protect users in countries where the government and the carrier cannot be trusted.

		Hey there, I hope this issue is correctly placed here. I want to split it in two tiers: My perception of what the Signal client lacks to be even more user-friendly and easily adaptable, and my personal suggestion, how this situation could be improved. I just realized, that this is a extension of #838 with a slightly different approach. Its still a relevant and interesting topic, in my opinion. The Problem There is a huge trade-off between privacy / trustworthiness and usability (ok, this was obvious). I use signal ever since it was TextSecure and started with SMS (maybe 3 years ago?) and watched it evolve over the time. It continuously became more seamless to use but in my perception, some of this implementations are diametrically opposed to the reason, we all use Signal: privacy. And on the other hand, there are some features that are still very annoying, and I'd bet that this is because of the integrity of the encryption. My Suggestion Eliminate the trade-off between security and convenience: Every feature, that makes the usage more smoothly but on the other hand compromises security / integrity / privacy, should be opt-in/opt-out (with reasonable defaults or a wizard to set them). I assume, that this could help signal to differentiate itself from the competition (e.g. WhatsApp, Threema, Telegram), while makeing it smoothly and even more secure and trustworthy at the same time. Some examples Convenience features, that should be defeatable The sync of my contacts (and everything, that is connected to it): The option could be something like &quot;Stop uploading my contactlist to the servers&quot; - with an explanation what that means to usability. Annoying &quot;features&quot;, that kill the user experience when re-registering or reinstalling the app, my friends need to manually add me to our groups. (My guess would be that this is because of the changed encryption-keys, however, it annoys me.) The option could be something like: &quot;Ignore key-changes in all conversations&quot; - with an explanation of what that means to vulnerability. What do you think? Is this even reasonable? Do you have more suggestons of opt-in-features? Best Regards!

Expected result: This is an Android defense mechanism to make sure apps aren't sending tons of SMS's in the background. &quot;Allow&quot; should add Signal to a whitelist and the error should stop popping up.

		Hi, out of interest, when comparing MAC digests, current implementation uses Arrays.equals(ourMacBytes, theirMacBytes) (in lieu of, lets say, the crypto friendly java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual). Not sure how relevant timing attack is in the context of the client performing such comparison in non-constant time fashion, but as a matter of principle, in a crypto conscious app, you'd think that ought to be there regardless, specially, that MAC digests are already truncated relative to their original ful length values.

Upon registering on the new phone the Group did not appear. When someone wrote tot he group again it appeared as Unnamed group, which I cannot rename, and in the group details view has a cryptic name. I can not write messages to the group from my phone (the text input area seems locked). I can however send messages to it from a linked web client, which works just fine and all members receive the messages I sent. I can however not remove myself from this group, nor can anybody else remove me. This behavior is utterly broken.

The first 492 is my local country code, it stays the same no matter what the actual one is, the second 492 depends on the number, if it Germany it is 492, if it the US it is 12.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I have a large group chat of Signal users (12), and when a message is sent to some, but not all of the members, (likely due to intermittent internet connectivity) that message may be spammed when the user attempts to resend the message by clicking on it for details, then manually clicking &quot;Resend&quot; to each member, to all members, the number of times the &quot;Resend&quot; button was clicked, plus one if they received the message the first time. Steps to reproduce Take a group message that failed to send to some users, but not all users. Click &quot;Resend&quot; on all of the users it failed to send to the first time. For every time the &quot;Resend&quot; button is pressed, all users will receive the message again, if this time it is successful. Actual result: So I walked around a large building that I was in, while on data, sending messages until one of them failed to send to some users, but not all. I then walked outside of the building, to where I had a good data connection, and pressed the &quot;Resend&quot; button on all of the users. Instead of re-sending to just the ones that were clicked, all users received the message, and those that had received it the first time, received it once more. Expected result: If a message fails to send to some users, when I press the &quot;Resend&quot; button to a specific user, it should resend the message to ONLY that user, or to all users that failed originally, but preventing the user from pressing the &quot;Resend&quot; button again, unless the resend fails once more.. Notes All users that have caused the spam have been Android users. I believe this might be caused by rapidly pressing all of the &quot;Resend&quot; buttons before Signal Resends the message.

Right now, saving media places it in the root of the media type (eg the &quot;Pictures&quot; directory) and backups get exported to the root of the device. I'd like to be able to specify an alternate directory, to keep my device less-cluttered. In the case of media in particular, it would be great if it would be possible to do in settings, so that the user won't have to choose a location in a dialogue every time they save something (or if there must be a dialogue, have it remember the last chosen location so the user doesn't have to navigate to the right directory every time)

			<description>
		Deterministic builds (Gitian) is an excellent, decentralized, secure means of distributing binaries: Gitian is a secure source-control oriented software distribution method. This means you can download trusted binaries that are verified by multiple builders. Gitian uses a deterministic build process to allow multiple builders to create identical binaries. This allows multiple parties to sign the resulting binaries, guaranteeing that the binaries and tool chain were not tampered with and that the same source was used. It removes the build and distribution process as a single point of failure. Gitian is used in the Bitcoin project. Yes, there have been many issues (e.g., #122, #127, #281, #282, #458, #525, #722, #2858, #3435, #3954, #4429, #4430) regarding distributing Signal in other ways than via Google Play or Apple Store, but I do not think my feature request is a duplicate of those.

		While contact discovery is useful for the usecase of an average user just wanting secure communication with their friends, it is a huge security risk for activists. Although Signal is not primarily aimed at activists, there are no suitable alternatives on mobile. Are there plans to improve Signal in this area? Numbers are available to anyone in the group chat, so adding someone to a group requires you have to trust them not to leak phone numbers. There are no display names, so having everyone introduce themselves to each other is tedious and requires adding each other to contact lists, which is potentially a security risk as well. Global display names would not solve the problem, as you'd need to use a separate one in your activism group chats and with your friends.

		This is a duplicate of #672, which was opened almost three years ago and forgotten about. Image compression in signal is ridiculous. Any text is completely illegible and anything else isn't worth saving. I'm not sure why it was set so high in the first place, but in 2016 it's just an annoying &quot;feature&quot;. 👍 4

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When trying to change one contact's color, Signal crashed. Since then, whenever I try to start Signal, it instantly crashes. When enabling airplane mode, Signal starts successfully (that's how I was able to produce a log - thanks to @FeuRenard for the tip). When I disable airplane mode while Signal is running, it crashes again. This could be related to the recently introduced contact color sync (with Signal Desktop). Steps to reproduce (correctly pointed out by @FeuRenard ) Pick a contact that is not in your address book (in my case a non-Signal i. e. SMS contact: a Facebook 2FA SMS with no phone number visible - just &quot;Facebook&quot; as the sender) Go to the contact preferences Change the contact color Device info Device: Google Nexus 5 Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.19.0 Debug log https://gist.github.com/RiseT/035f7ee2e622852a16d0c18ace62b0bf#file-signal-android-issue-5704-txt

		Especially when the internet connection is bad, Redphone calls sometimes break. It would be great to hear a sound as soon as a call ends, because I happened to continue talking quite often without noticing that the call is already over. The feature is available in normal phone calls too, so I think Signal should definitely have it.

		In order to counter shoulder surfing an option could be added to show a contact in: name + (wherever possible) phone number (as is currently done and default option name only (no phone numbers are shown anywhere unless contact is not in address book phone numbers only (no names are shown anywhere, only initial letter in contact avatar) (alternatively as name, the same initial could be used as is used for the contact's avatar) Places where this applies is the overview of contacts, a dialogue, notification drawer et cetera. Implementing would greatly counter shoulder surfing in terms of with whom one is commuicating.

There's already a way to export to clear text, but this doesn't backup the keys. And, this is manual. I need this, otherwise wiping my device, or switching to a new one, is going to be painful. Or, to put it another way, if my phone is lost, so is all my messaging. Who isn't an advocate for backups? Please?

		We need a per-contact setting to disable secure messaging, and just use regular SMS. Why? I have come across contacts who are incorrectly considered to be Signal users. That is to say: Signal wants to send them encrypted messages over data, but these people do not have Signal installed, and claim to have never used Signal or TextSecure previously. I assume the issue comes about from mobile number re-use.

However, When Signal is selected from App Drawer, or Home, the conversation list is always displayed as if first being run. This is nonstandard from other messenger apps and does not give the user the functionality they expect. Steps to reproduce Select Signal from either Home or App Drawer Select a conversation Press the Home Key Select Signal from home or App Drawer Actual result: When selecting signal from either the app drawer or home screen you are always presented with the same conversation list. Expected result: A New user expects selecting signal from the app drawer or home screen to return to the last open window (be it the last conversation, setting screen, etc) just as if they selected it from the recent apps list.

This is because the description string changes from the rather short ExpirationDialog_your_messages_will_not_expire to the rather lengthy ExpirationDialog_your_messages_will_disappear_s_after_they_have_been_seen. Please add space for one (or even two to be really sure) more line of text in the description so the window size stays constant for both strings. I guess this should suffice for any language. PS: Additionally, I think it would look better if you added a bit of vertical space below the title ('Disappearing messages') as well. Steps to reproduce (doesn't apply to e. g. English) Open conversation Select 'Disappearing messages' Scroll from 'Off' to some other timeframe Actual result: Window size changes when switching timeframe Expected result: Window size stays constant Device info Device: LG Nexus 5X Android version: 7.0.0 Signal version: 3.20.0

		I found an error in the germane translation of the notifications when changing the time for disappearing messages. Du hat die Zeit zum Verschwinden der Nachricht auf 1 Woche festgelegt The string above contains three errors. Correct is: Du hast die Zeit zum Verschwinden der Nachrichten auf 1 Woche festgelegt**.** (Also note the dot at the end.) Since I don't know if the English language string is correct and if the German string can be fixed by translation I post this one as issue. Found with build 3.20.3 (and older).

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description The app crashes immediately upon viewing a message thread that contains a media message (i.e. image). The thread can never be viewed, not even in airplane mode. It is also not possible to delete the thread: moving to archive works, but trying to delete from archive results in the same crash. Because I expected it to be a corrupt database issue I have completely removed the signal app data and re-registered my phone. The app worked again but was more unstable than I previously experienced. As soon as I received a media message the thread makes the app crash again like before. Two things I did before I ran into those problems: Updated Fairphone OS from FP2 release 1.6.1 to 1.8.1 Updated Android Web View from Play Store I have no idea if any of those events are really related to the crashes, though. Just to try I have also uninstalled the Web View updates but that did not lead to an improvement. Note: The updates to the Fairphone OS should only have contained the latest google security fixes up to October and no other feature changes. Steps to reproduce receive media message from contact try to open message from notifications or from contact list in app Actual result: App force closes immediately Expected result: Message thread should be displayed Screenshots none Device info Device: Fairphone2 Android version: 5.1 (r4275.1_FP2_gms66_1.8.1) Signal version: 3.20.4 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/845adc40ff80f0d3fdd506641bc41f2c

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description This is a feature request/wish: A recent update added Giphy support. While I am not too convinced by the usefulness of this, I understand that for many users it is very important. However, trying to find a useful GIF or sticker in Signal is a fools errand of scrolling through a myriad of rather low-quality GIFs/stickers (does it just display the most recently uploaded ones?). A search field would in my opinion go a long way to make this more useful. Steps to reproduce Try to send a friend a &quot;Thanks Obama&quot; GIF (example specimen: https://giphy.com/gifs/13ypZYdIckeO5O). Select Attachment-&gt;Giphy. Scroll through endless list of other GIFs that don't express the sentiment I try to convey. Actual result: I give up before ever sending the message. Expected result: I should be able to find a GIF if I already roughly know what I am looking for.

		One of the requests that came out of the work to improve photo quality (#672) was the ability to simply send photos exactly as they are, without reprocessing them. In the other thread, there are many good reasons why there isn't an option to handle photos that way, dealing with the previews, display, memory limitations, etc. It occurs to me that the way to allow this option to those that need it - and also provide more utility overall - is to provide an option to send arbitrary file types - including photos - without processing them. There are currently choices for Images, Audio, Video when sending a message. Just give us an option for &quot;Files&quot;. Add an option to the attachment area for &quot;File&quot;. If we pick a picture via the file option, instead of the image option, we just send the image exactly as is with no processing / preview / etc. The bonus is it now works for any file type.... and I can finally send full resolution images without having to revert to e-mail or something like that. Giving us the ability to push them through as files, however, bypasses a all of the issues related to device memory, preview, etc. Following the existing UI design / pattern gives the user customizability over what is downloaded (and when - only wifi, etc). It also now lets us send any other document securely, which would be a great bonus. Not sure what the upper limit needs to be on the file size... but even if it was as low as 10 MBs, we could send full resolution photos.

		Signal includes the Apple Color Emoji library to render emoji's on Android. The problem is that Apple developed it strictly for their own use and they are not licensing it to anybody. This puts the Android version of Signal in a legal grey area. This could be fixed by switching to an alternative emoji library. For something similar to Apple's library, Twitter's Twemoji could be considered.

		Hi. I'm using Signal since some time and there is one thing which still confuses me. There is no visible option to access archived messages. Swiping message right archives a message. If you made a mistake you can undo the action. But how to access archived messages in general? I can not see any option to do this.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I have had this problem several times now. Sometimes when i respond to a signal message, it send's an sms (I'm not Holding the send button) wich don't get delivered because i don't have a simcard in my phone. It is sitting in airplane mode just with wifi turned on and connected to the interent via hotspot. When i delete this particular sms message and try to send another message to an registered Signal user it just shows the bouncing 3 dots. It never leaves the phone. It never tells that the message can't be delivered or something similar. I have to wait till an update is avalable or reinstall signal. EDIT: And i just noticed that the camera ain't working in the app too at the moment. I will terminate the signal process and capture another log. When i get my other Phone back i will try to reproduce this behaviour. The last time it happened, was when i got a msg from a user who just registered and typed my phone number in and hit send after the app showing him that i am a signal user. I got the msg, but couldn't reply to it with a data msg. Only SMS Steps to reproduce -I could not reproduce this one Actual result: Signal users dissapear. Can't send any Messages. Just make calls Expected result: Don't stuck in any thread where it tries to deliver the sms and send normal signal data Messages.

		Signal messages have delivery reports by default, but SMS conversations do not. That results in kind of a confusing UX where some conversations have double checkmarks to confirm delivery, and some do not. Turning on the &quot;SMS delivery reports&quot; option by default would improve this. 👍 2

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal lets you send voice notes, even if it is plaintext sms. Therefore GSM message. And therefore extremely expensive. Steps to reproduce Have Signal installed as your default messenger. Use it to send regular SMS. Open conctact who is not a Signal user. Press push to talk. Send voice note. Actual result: Voice note is send. Since it is transmitted via GSM it is converted to an MMS message. And MMS messages are extremely expensive. I pay 0.49€ for a single one. I know that in other countrys you pay a lot less, if at all. So I wanted to you to be aware of it. Expected result: I don't know really know to be honest. Just hide it in sms mode works for me. But at the same time is probably quite annoying for someone who does not have to pay for mms messages and would like to use that feature even in sms mode. Differentiate userbase for location and mms fees and hide/show push-to-talk button accordingly is probably a PITA. Sorry no easy solution here. But I can see people using the voice-notes. And paying a hefty bill afterwards. Which, although it is the users fault, could lead to bad Signal reputation.

		As I see from 541718f Signal does implement some ways to circumvent censorship. This issue is mostly a report, I'm not sure if anything can actually be done. I've been in Cuba recently with Signal, registered with an European phone number (there are wifi hotspots in public locations); The Signal servers are not reachable from Cuba, I could not send/receive messages; It did work properly using Tor (Orbot). I see from the commit I referenced that Signal identifies censoring countries with their international phone prefix, so I'm not sure if it would have helped in my case. I did not try to register with a Cuban phone number. 👍 1

		Hello, There was a case in Germany some months ago, where a suspects end-to-end messenger traffic has been decrypted by the German police. In this case it was the application telegram. But I started thinking about this issue, and maybe the same hack could be used with signal too. You might know that signal has a desktop application. The German police used a desktop Application like this to get access to the messages of the suspect. They just requested access to a desktop application, man-in-the-middle'd the incoming Activation-SMS, and had full access to the messages. [1] Is this possible with Signal, too? It would be nice to have an option to disable multiple clients [1] https://motherboard.vice.com/de/read/exklusiv-wie-das-bka-telegram-accounts-von-terrorverdaechtigen-knackt (GERMAN, sorry no english version available)

		Because domain fronting will not work when, for example, you go to Egypt as a tourist with a number from another country, it would be nice to be able to switch it on with an option. When automatic detection of blocking is implemented this option could then be removed again. Another question: why not enable domain fronting for everyone? In some countries Signal may not be blocked but contacting the Signal servers may give you a big &quot;red flag&quot; from intelligence agancies. Is there some technical or other reason why activating it for everyone would not be a good idea?

Steps to reproduce in a group, turn on disappearing messages. my group had ~8 members. verify that the disappearing setting is on (hourglass on messages) a member who was not the group creator left. (checking with the user to verify platform and version) my android build showed &quot;[creator] set disappearing message time to Off&quot; immediately after &quot;[user] has left the group&quot;. the group creator states they did not turn off disappearing messages. following messages were not marked as disappearing. previous messages disappeared correctly. creator was able to re-enable disappearing after noticing the problem and new messages are disappearing, but the non-disappearing ones are still there. Actual result: disappearing setting disabled when a user left. Expected result: disappearing setting should remain enabled unless turned off explicitly.

It seems unlikely that any reasonable user would figure out the method mentioned in #6014 for removing contacts or even just resyncing them with the Android address book. Even if they were motivated enough to find this method, the process even warns the user that their data will be lost when this is not the case.

		The &quot;domain fronting&quot; technique to circumvent censorship can be enabled for all users regardless of what mobile number they had used to register or will use to register. Consider the case in which a user with a Canadian number already registered in Canada goes to UAE where Signal is blocked! He must use a VPN solution to access Signal servers. Signal can try main servers if it needs to establish a connection, if failed then try again using domain fronting and this can be enabled for all users by default OR can be added as an option in the welcome screen (first time registration) and in the advanced setting page.

		feature request: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/image-keyboard.html Users often want to communicate with emojis, stickers, and other kinds of rich content. In previous versions of Android, soft keyboards (also known as input method editors or IMEs) could send only unicode emoji to apps. For rich content, apps had to either build app-specific APIs that couldn't be used in other apps or use workaround like sending images through Easy Share Action or the clipboard. With Android 7.1 (API level 25), the Android SDK includes the Commit Content API, which provides a universal way for IMEs to send images and other rich content directly to a text editor in an app. The API is also available in v13 Support Library as of revision 25.0.0. We recommend using the Support Library because it runs on devices as early as Android 3.2 (API Level 13), and it contains helper methods that simplify implementation. With this API, you can build messaging apps that accept rich content from any keyboard, as well as, keyboards that can send rich content to any app. The Google Keyboard and apps like Google Messenger support the Commit Content API in Android 7.1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports I was in a room without internet, i sent many messages (pictures) to another contact. Of course, textsecure/signal told me, that the messages wasn't sent. After that i was in the need to resent every message manual. The feature I'm missing is the possibility to groupselect/multiselect every message, which couldn't be sent and to resent it (dependent on the sent time). At the moment, it is only possible to select one message, click on the options and click on resent. If I select two or more entry's, this option is gone.

Steps to reproduce Register a Signal account &gt; Complete the registration Register Signal on another device and complete the registration Close the Signal application (with password enabled - but occurs also without password enabled) Send messages to the device with the Signal application closed Actual result: Well, like in the title, from what I've saw is that the messages are not received until the Signal application is opened. Is this the intended behavior? I mean I also have WhatsApp installed that can receive messages even when the application is closed from the task switcher. (it seems that it has a background process / service working, maybe this is why?) Note that i have Notifications enabled, Background Data is not restricted, I have good Internet connection and using Android 5.1.1.

		Hi Developers at Open Whisper Systems,

Thanks for submitting your app for Android Auto. We reviewed your app, Signal Private Messenger, with package name org.thoughtcrime.securesms, and noticed some eligibility issues.

App status: Your app has not been accepted into Android Auto, and the update is not live on Google Play.

Eligibility issues by APK version:
APK Version(s)	Eligibility Issue
230	Your app does not support all of the required voice commands.
You can read more about how to support Voice Actions here: https://developer.android.com/training/auto/audio/index.html#support_voice
To be considered for Android Auto:

Make the necessary changes to your app.
Increment the version number of the upgraded APK.
Submit your app for another review.
Or, if you’d like to exclude your app from Android Auto:

Remove the Android Auto manifest entry from your APK code.
Sign in to your Developer Console and upload the new APK.
Click Submit update.
 I don't really know what voice commands they're referring to, and I don't have any way to test. It's blocking the release, so I'm going to remove android auto from the manifest entry for now. @snaggen are you willing to look into this?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description App floods phone with nonstop notifications after desktop texting Steps to reproduce Turn off your phone Open the Signal Private Messenger app Do a bunch of texting with the desktop app. Make sure to view all messages sent back at you. Turn on the phone Actual result: Watch your phone flood with notifications - buzzing, etc. It will last for many minutes. In my case, almost 5 full minutes. My phone died, I needed to do a bunch of texting via the webapp, and when I turned the app on again - I basically DOS'ed my own phone. It was going through messages slowly and individually, since it gets the message first, sends the notification, and only then marks its read/unread state. Expected result: From a user experience/product perspective, if I was opening the app after the phone was shutdown (or reception was reentered or whatever), I wouldn't want to see the buzzing, and have to wait. I'd simply see a single notification (or perhaps, no notification at all), and be able to use my phone immediately. tl;dr I shouldn't get a notification at all for a message if it was read on either platform.

Impact If a device is rooted, any app running on the device can have access to read sensitive PII. If the user chooses to submit a bug report for any other unrelated app, even on a factory device, sensitive PII will be leaked. This PII may be uploaded to a phone manufacturer’s servers for crash report analysis, compromising the security of that user’s Signal contact list.

This is not intended to be a critique of the crypto design or implementation of ZRTP but rather to reflect that two call recipients without knowledge of cryptography expressed concern that not having the SAS could result in possible interception of the calls. The reaction was not related to the technical details of the Signal protocol but rather a sudden, unexplained change in a ritual that accompanied previous usage of the service. At least one call recipient was using the latest iOS beta. I apologize if this is considered more to be a comment than a bug. Steps to reproduce Place WebRTC call Look for previously existing SAS codes Actual result: SAS codes are not visible and there is no explanation for why they are no longer there. Expected result: Either to see the SAS codes or, in the case that they have been purposefully removed, perhaps some other (transitional) visual indication of call security (particularly vis-a-vis tapping or middle attack interception in lieu of the old SAS word pairs.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Messages (also pictures, GIFs, voice notes, etc) is sent to participant are shown as pending to download (white rounded icon), but never downloading till change from WLAN to Cellular network. On other device media is marked as send and received (if in Cellular). Or pending to send if on wifi Works in both ways (from device A to B and from B to A). Both devices using Android 6.0.1. It seems I should blame my WLAN. But nothing is blocked there. Could it be that Provider did blocked something? It also strange that placeholders are created (information is partly received), but not messages. Steps to reproduce Device A is in the home WLAN. Picture/GIF/Voice Note was sent from B to A. B see Medial marked as send. A see only message placeholder and spinning circle forever in WLAN. A disable WLAN and immediately in Cellular Network got all media files downloaded. Works in a both ways. Actual result: Only message placeholder and spinning circle are shown forever in WLAN. Expected result: Media downloaded, messages recieved.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When in the &quot;Update group&quot; screen, the button to tap to finish the update says &quot;CREATE GROUP&quot;, while it should say something like &quot;UPDATE&quot; or simply &quot;DONE&quot;. In general I don't like the &quot;Update group&quot; wording, it's confusing and doesn't pass the idea of an active action (modifying the group). &quot;Modify group&quot; or &quot;Manage group&quot; would be better. Moreover, after updating the group the string &quot;Updated the group.&quot; is shown to the modifying user in the conversation. I think it should be &quot;You updated the group.&quot;, for clarity and grammar. Steps to reproduce Create a group, enter its conversation and then open the &quot;Update group&quot; menu item. The &quot;CREATE GROUP&quot; thing is probably shown only on bigger displays. Try to reproduce with a Nexus 6 in an emulator.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description On the Android Beta for signal (with video calls enabled), making a voice call to another signal user produces a low-volume (in-ear only; not speaker) ring sound that is inaudible. This happens for the call reciever. If the call reciever, prior to picking up the phone, hits the &quot;speaker&quot; button, the volume of the ringer reaches the expected volume. Steps to reproduce Enable video calls on beta on both recieving and calling device Recieve signal call on either phone. ACTUAL RESULT Volume doesn't come through speaker (only ear speaker). (EXPECTED RESULT load volume through speaker). Disable video calls on beta (on either or both devices) Recieve signal call. Note that volume comes through speaker (and is loud).

The peer have been writing to my other phone so it works. However I was able to verify safety number (for an insecure only session?), but no reset session and like. He wasn't able to message me. Then I have opened up the chrome web client, and seen the following (old) exchange: old messages (ok) some old messages which were neither delivered nor received and the web client says &quot;number is not registered&quot; a 'secure session reset' old message, with number not registered as well Then I have tried to send a new message from the web client, and it was successfully delivered.

Steps to reproduce send an image, taken with the standard camera from one device to another, no other steps involved Actual result: Image is compressed from 3264x2448px, 1.5MB to 408x306 px, 36.4KB. Image is not even close to being usable (in this case it is a foto of an time schedule). There is no option available to send the image in a way where it can be used on the recipient side. Seems to be related to #672 (didn't read though it as it is closed and I would expect that to mean resolved) Expected result: Images are received only with mild compression, not affecting the image visibly. Suggestion: Lower the compression rate and allow for the option to send uncompressed images (either via the image send dialogue or introduce an option to send all file types. Last would be fulfilled by #993, which is unfortunately locked for comment. Also I don't like to idea of my data being modified without the possibility to change this. Note: I did not add any further information as I expect this to be device independent. Further information can be provided if needed.

I totally understand and partly agree with @moxie0 's critcism of f-droid security. However, one can address those issues by creating his own f-droid repo and sign it with his own key. Projects that did so include Guardian Project. Information on how this can be done can be found here Why this is important Recently, a very important change has been made - it is now possible to use Signal without Gapps, and that also means that many new Signal users have to download the Signal apk off third party services, like apkpure, which is insecure and makes it impossible to update in a timely manner, which contradicts fundamental believes shared by WhisperSystems team in general and @moxie0 in particular. 👍 20

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description While I was writing a message, several messages came in (media and also text). Suddenly Signal froze, shortly after the phone froze and rebootet. Now I cannot start Signal anymore. It crashes instantly at the start. Steps to reproduce No idea how to simulate my phones/Signals state Start Signal -&gt; Crash Actual result: Signal crashes instantly and does not load Expected result: Signal should work as expected (in this case it should be able to handle the error, whatever error it is actually) Device info Android version: LineageOS 14.1 Signal version: 30.3.4 ###Additional information: Maybe this is of relevance: I see a lot of websocketconnection in the crash log but actually I am using play services...

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Feature description Most of signal messages I send to my buddies only get delivered( or calls tried notified) when their signal app is opened. This was the case with me until I moved to AOSP and with the new solution for non play services users, now the messages come in very swiftly even when the app is not in foreground. All my buddies are on stock rom and I understand there may be issues with play services configuration etc.. But not everyone are geeks and everyone cannot move to AOSP for different reasons and not everyone can or wants to contact support with debug log when there are good alternatives for instant messaging already installed on their phones. So if the affected users have ability to choose between type of notifying services (GCM PUSH or the WEBSOCKET one), it would simply overcome the issues of no/sluggish notifications and message delivery. 👍 5

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description It has happened a few times now that while I'm having a call I suddenly stop hearing the other party's voice after a while (~several minutes) but they can still hear my voice. So far this has happened only when I'm having a call with Signal iOS. But I haven't had long calls with another Signal Android so nothing to say about that. Steps to reproduce Call Signal iOS device Talk for some time Actual result: Suddenly I stop hearing the other party's voice but they can still hear my voice. Expected result: Both parties can hear each other for the duration of the whole call Device info Android Device: Moto G4 Play Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.30.4 iOS Device: iPhone 4S iOS version: 9.3.5 Signal version: 2.7.1 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3d87be38fce2a11107b10164322a96bc https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c0102e788ffd853143dbd1ec78a213f1 I guess the relevant parts are before I disconnect the call after I notice that I can't hear the other party anymore Unfortunately, I don't have logs from iOS Related issues In #4532, #6140, #6271 the other party can't hear anything but it seems that the silence is there from the beginning of the call, not after talking successfully for several minutes.

Attempts to call multiple contacts have failed multiple times. It just keeps 'pinging' for about 2 minutes then it gives up. Before collecting the debug log i tried about half a dozen times to call another Signal user. Steps to reproduce I'm not sure if it's reproducible, but here's what i did: Install Copperhead with Noise. Attempt to call a regular Signal user who is using GAPPS. Actual result: Call fails, the 'ringing' never begins. Expected result: Call goes through.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When I have entered text into a text message field and then want to delete a typo I press the delete key. At this point signal inserts a previous word from my message, appends it to the location below my cursor and deletes from it. This causes it to take about twice as long to delete any word, as it inserts a word on first delete press. Steps to reproduce Type a message hit delete notice that there are extra characters inserted that were not there before delete was pressed. Actual result: A word from previously in the message is now before the cursor. (but with a letter deleted as a result of pressing delete) (the word is also still in its proper place in the message) Expected result: The character before the cursor should be deleted.

Both devices re-registered, synced contacts, rebooted, after 3.31.0 update. If I try to place a call from the Blackberry, all seems ok, I have the &quot;DIALING&quot; screen and sound, but the other end (device Alcatel) doesnt ring. After 20/30 seconds I abort the call on the Blackberry with the red &quot;hangup&quot; button; the other end (Alcatel) gives instantly a missed call notification.

		Debug logs: https://gist.github.com/a2c764a64dcd5c6b0b7cb297554d4c46 Chrome Version 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit) I use multiple user profiles simultaneously to keep work and personal content separate. : installed extensions: Cisco WebEx Extension 1.0.8 Google Docs 0.9 Google Docs Offline 1.4 Google Sheets 1.1 Google Slides 0.9 LastPass: Free Password Manager 4.1.41 Signal Private Messenger 0.32.1 Tampermonkey 4.2.7 OS version: Windows 10 Enterprise Version 1607, OS build 14393.693 Behavior: After upgrading from a windows 7 machine to windows 10, Signal has become unreliable. I see the message popup indicating I've gotten a new message, and about 80% of the time when I click the popup, my chrome instance is highlighted, but the signal instance does not appear. I've enabled, disabled, removed, re-added, re re re,moved , re re added etc a number of times with no change in behavior. Once I have the window open and working, it will continue to work as long as I do not close the window. once I close the window, it's anyone's guess whether it will come back again. Sometimes I have the signal icon showing in the control panel open programs list, where I have attempted to bookmark the signal icon so it is easily accessible: If I hover over the icon and I can see the program preview, signal will work as expected. If the icon will not show up, or hovering does not show the program preview, there is literally nothing I can do to convince the window for signal to show itself. It is obviously running, because I still get the message alerts- but the actual message window can not be accessed. I attempted to go to the extension, and use the &quot;create shortcut&quot; option from the extension window. This will very occasionally work, but it's rare. the shortcut mainly gives me a &quot;working&quot; icon, and then does nothing. I can also go to the &quot;view in store&quot; and select &quot;launch app&quot; from the chrome store. Again, occasionally this will work, but almost never. mostly it just does nothing. I have been paying attention, but I can not find any consistency for when it will work vs when it will not work. It does not seem more likely to work after a reboot or before, And I believe it has randomly started to work in the middle of a browser session (though I'm not 100% sure). The only thing that Has changed about my configuration is the OS version, so I'm sure there is something environmental causing this- but I have not been able to narrow down what triggers the behavior. One more interesting thing I just discovered: It's more likely to work if I use one chorme profile than another. when it fails to work, it always highlights the shortcut to the chrome profile that works less often. The extension shows as installed on both. Perhaps this is a strange side effect of windows 10 + profiles in chrome?

It's very confusing: who updated what? The string name is GroupUtil_group_updated, called just two times in GroupUtil.java. It should be changed in something more precise, like: &quot;UserX changed the group name from X to Y&quot;. (It's just an example, maybe group name changes are already precise, the point is that I don't know what triggers the &quot;Group updated&quot; message!)

		Bug description When using the power button of the device the FLAG_SECURE is ineffective and the screenshot appears with the information. This is actually a bug on Android platform and have been fixed only in versions above 7.x. My goal with this issue is to understand if there may be implemented a workaround for earlier versions of android like change to a blank fragment during the onPause() or onStop() event. In the API there is supposedly a function that would allow to generate a custom thumbnail but it's never triggered. I opened a ticket in Google regarding this but so far nobody assigned the ticket (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=235166) Steps to reproduce Navigate to a particular screen with information Press the power button of the device to lock the screen.

Steps to reproduce Attempt to send Signal message to Teenager Message is sent fine (one tick) Hours later, notice that Teenager has not replied, and message still has only one tick Manually send message via long-press SMS Actual result: Teenager doesn't actually receive the message until it has been manually been sent via SMS Expected result: An app setting should allow automatic fallback to SMS/MMS if the message has not been delivered to the recipient after N minutes. (Signal would ideally need a way to identify when two copies are received, one via SMS/MMS and one via Signal when cellular or Wifi permits the original message to arrive) For many people, the encrypted nature of Signal messages is less important than a single, reliable messaging app, and these people are nonetheless important for growing the Signal user base. (BTW, I found some old bugs about fallback if the senders internet is intermittent, but not the receivers)

Trying to sign up for Signal resulted in a failure, as the App requires me for some reason to update the Play Services before continuing. This locks me out. [I dont think this is wanted behavior. Looking into src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/RegistrationActivity.java, it looks like ConnectionResult.SERVICE_DISABLED is supposed to be treated as MISSING but that doesn't seem to work.] Steps to reproduce Disable all 3 Google Play &quot;Core Apps&quot; (listed below) Open a freshly installed Signal Type in Country and Phone Number and press Register Actual result: A pop up appears: Update Google Play Services Signal won't run unless you update Google Play Services. This is impossible as they are intentionally disabled and unwanted as we want to use Websocket push. Expected result: The registration happens and Signal sets up so that gcmdisabled true is set. Signal can be used. (Treat this as if the Google Play service components were just MISSING) Device info Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 3.31.4 Stock Rom. Newly of the shelf bought phone. disabled apps: com.google.android.gms com.android.vending com.google.android.gsf Debug log not available as signup is impossible.

They are difficult to recognize, remember, and associate with a name. There should be a way for users to specify a name to be shown when in a conversation with an user that doesn't have the number in his/her contacts list. When the number is in the contact list, the contact list name has to be displayed. This has to be optional.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal-to-signal messaging has stopped working about an hour ago, 2300 EST. Confirmed encrypted messages aren't sending or receiving via signal to individuals or groups. Also reset the secure session to test but did not fix. I can receive regular SMS and data is connected. Steps to reproduce send encrypted SMS Actual result: Signal tries to send and gives a not delivered failure message. Selecting the message for more info and pressing resend does the same thing. Confirmed on group signal chat as well as to three individual chats. Expected result: Encrypted SMS sent. Screenshots None.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Text Message appears 17 days later. This happened a couple of minutes ago. While chatting with a couple of friends via Signal Desktop, I noticed that in the taskbar it said &quot;Signal (1)&quot;, implying a new message is there. But somehow it didn't show up. So I took my phone to have another look. Turns out I just received a message from Febr. 28th. How? oO I managed to grab a debug log right after I read the text message on my phone. I am unable to obtain one from the other phone. It is probably useless anyways. Steps to reproduce Expected result: Don't do that ;) Screenshots Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy S5 Android version: see log Signal version: see log Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f4d4a3da6e89aa4e7b1d7f4dc682cdb6

		Improve local storage encryption. Now only the content of the messages is encrypted. If forensics can bypass androids FDE, they can collect metadata. Please don't assume that androids FDE is safer than local encryption implemented right.

		Bug description I opened Signal after an automatic update to 4.1.0. It asked me to re-initialize my phone number as if it were a new install. Once it opened, my message history was completely gone. I re-imported from the sms database, and it only imported everything from before I installed Signal, nearly 6 months ago. I attempted to import from a text backup to see if the update had made one, but it was not found. It appears the message history is lost. Steps to reproduce Allow Signal to auto update via the play store. Open Signal It will ask you to re-initialize your phone number. Upon successful initialization, find all of your messages lost. Actual result: All of my Signal message history was gone. I was able to re-import SMS messages from before installing Signal the first time, over 6 months ago.

		I know this is a duplicate of #614 but I am unable to post there, and I was wondering if this would be a feasible solution for the problem mentioned there. Could you look at using the signal desktop repository as a combined android app repository specifically for tablets and other currently non supported devices. I know this is possible in some circumstances because, DuckieTV (github.com/SchizoDuckie/DuckieTV) also use a single JavaScript repository, but they compile it for multiple OS like Android, Linux, Windows, OSX and a chrome add on. I think they do this with the help of AngularJS. Thanks

		For the past few days I have been having a strange issue. I convinced my fiance to use signal as both a messaging and texting app. But lately I cannot send my messages as text. I think you should enable the ability to switch off signal messages manually since the automatic is buggy. It sucks because I use signal every day.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal is unable to send or receive messages over an LTE / 3G connection if NetGuard is active simultaneously on the device. This behaviour persists even if Signal is given full access to both WiFi and cellular connections in NetGuard. This behaviour is unique to cellular data connections. Signal works properly on WiFi while NetGuard is active. It is not yet clear whether the problem is in Signal or in NetGuard. If it turns out to be the latter, then a help / faq page saying &quot;NetGuard breaks Signal, there's just no way to make it work, here are alternatives / workarounds&quot; would be a good idea. Running without NetGuard or a similarly capable alternative is not a workaround, as that would permit other apps to quickly gobble up mobile data (which, in this case, is expensive and in extremely limited supply). Steps to reproduce Debug log attached, generated as follows: While an active WiFi connection is present, close and then start Signal. Verify that NetGuard is set normally (firewall is on, Signal has full access for both WiFi and cellular modes). Move outside the range of the WiFi connection. Device automatically switches to LTE connection. Attempt to send a plain text message in Signal. Actual result: Get a &quot;failed to send message&quot; error. Expected result: Message is sent, shows 1 checkbox (sent), shortly thereafter shows 2 checkboxes (received). Turn off NetGuard entirely. Try sending the message again in signal. Actual result: Message is sent correctly. Expected result: No change. Re-enable NetGuard and move back into WiFi range. Actual result: Signal works normally.

		There are situations where the device where Signal is installed can't directly receive SMS messages, but the users can receive the message on another device/service. Some devices do not have a sim card slot but the users owns another phone that can receive messages. Other users want to register with a phone number bought from a service like Twilio. In these cases it is difficult to register with the current procedure. I propose this kind of solution: After the 2 minutes SMS timeout, a screen is shown to the user, asking to manually enter the code receives via SMS. The screen also have a clear button that says &quot;I didn't receive any sms&quot;, or something like that. If the user taps on &quot;I didn't receive the SMS&quot;, the current voice verification screen is shown. The vast majority of the users will never see this screen. I think there are more users which can receive messages on a different device than users that try to register, expect to receive the message, but then something does not work. 👍 2

		I would appreciate it if it would be possible to sign up without giving you a phone number. This would be another advantage over WhatsApp. Of course, Signal promises not to save it but I still can't understand why I should install a crypto messenger and then have my phone number transferred to some server somewhere in the world. If it is necessary that every user has a number, users who do not want to use their own number could get another, randomly created number (which starts with 000, for example). There is another crypto messenger, &quot;Hoccer&quot;, with which this is already possible.

		https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-only-complete-prs-and-test-them states that folks shouldn't submit work-in-progress PRs. That seems like a very bad idea to me. WIP PRs are very useful for answering questions like: Am I heading down the right direction with respect to this code's design? I implemented part of this change, if I finish the rest would it be accepted? I'm stuck with such-and-such an error, how can I solve it? I've made a change on this line but I'm not 100% sure it's correct, can someone confirm? All of these questions have to go somewhere. It might as well be somewhere where it's easiest to answer - in a Pull Request where you have the full diff available to contextualize all discussion. Does this requirement exist because people would submit incomplete PRs that made tests fail, etc.? In that case, I propose the text be amended to say something like &quot;if submitting a Pull Request that's not ready for merging, prefix its title with [WIP].&quot; 👍 6

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description There are two issues with the latest change of Signal translations: &quot;Contact joined Signal&quot; string in the &quot;Events&quot; chapter is missing from translations, In the &quot;Message font size&quot; chapter the word &quot;Normal&quot; has an old translation string, probobly the one also used in &quot;LED pattern&quot;. That's not the problem in English language but in Slovenian the word gets transleted to &quot;Normalno&quot;, which is ok for &quot;LED pattern&quot; but it's not an ok translation for &quot;Message font size&quot; (it sholud be: &quot;Normalne&quot;). Please add &quot;Normal&quot; as a separate translation for &quot;Message font size&quot;.

		I have seen various groups chat bugs here, but this one I couldn't find so far: After exporting all messages and then importing them on a new device, messages from group charts appear under the account who sent them instead of in the group. Without the context of the conversation many such messages however are completely useless and, worse, even mess up the chats with the individual contracts. Is there some way to preserve group chats when moving device? If not this seems to be a serious bug that drastically limits the usefulness of group chats. 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal crashes, when I when there is an incoming SIgnal voice call from an Android device or an outgoing Signal call to an Android device (I didn't test with the iOS version). For incoming calls, the crash happens immediately when the ringing would normally start. When I restart Signal afterwards, I see that there is a missed call. For outgoing calls, the crash happens immediately, after the call screen is shown, before the ringing starts. Steps to reproduce Be called on Signal Android by a Signal Android device (no need to pick up or even have the screen active) Alternatively, call a Signal Android device. Actual result: Signal crashes immediately. Expected result: Signal should not crash and establish a call. Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy S2 (I9100) Android version: 7.1.1.

		Signal version 4.3.2 Android 7.1.2 Pixel XL, not rooted Google Play Service 10.2.98 I had a prior conversation with a contact today. About 20 minutes ago I tried messaging that same contact after leaving my office, Single immediately went into a crash loop and threw the screen allowing me to report feedback (I've reported it a few times with some descriptive text). The crash still happened after I deleted the cache to Signal. I set the device to airplane mode and reopened Signal. I was able to open the app without a crash. Opening up the conversation with said friend I could see the message I had sent was still in a pending state (3 dots animating). I long held on the message, deleted it, killed the app (app switcher swipe), turned off airplane mode, reopened the app. No crash. Again I attempted to message my friend, again hit a boot crash. Repeated my airplane mode steps, then went back to Signal while online and tried to send a message to a different contact. That worked fine, no crash, double check marks. I left it alone. After about 30 minutes said contact tried messaging me again and the app in the background threw the Android crash submit feedback popup box. The airplane mode trick no longer works, nor does clearing cache. Also my session through the Chrome extension is running fine. I can see the last message I received from the friend was &quot;Yeah, k&quot; before any further messages from me or him would cause the app to give up on life. At this time I was able to logcat the crash in the state that it is in now and attaching thta at the end of this bug report. I am assuming my only option at this point is to clear app data to get out of this bad state. bitmoji

		Just started suddenly. My app notifications will not go off unless I go to the app and reopen it. It'll then decide to tell me someone sent me a message X # of minutes ago. Was working fine all day and almost all the time until a couple hours ago. I've checked all the settings and notifications are set to go off. My desktop app is not on on any of my computers either so that's not interfering. It's not being automatically marked as read, it's just simply not notifying me unless I reopen the app. I've restarted the phone and the app is updated according to the play store. The only person I use this app with is also a verified Signal user. I do not force close this app with the task killer like other apps. I always have it open in the background.

		Can't register without google play services. If play services is disabled after registration, the app gives warning notifications &quot;Permanent Signal com....&quot; &quot;Signal was unable to register with google play services&quot; (although the app still works). Text delivery is sporadic and unreliable. Do you people even test the app before putting it on the market? Don't publish an app with a big press release saying that it will work without google play services if you haven't even tested it and it, in fact, doesn't work. Pathetic. How is it that Telegram has so many more features, and works so successfully, yet your app doesn't? Incompetent developers. 👍 1 👎 2

		First of all, I've never come across another app that won't allow the user to bypass the &quot;update play services&quot; popup by clicking outside the popup, and then work as normal, if indeed the app doesn't REQUIRE play services (but still attempts to use it for something). Signal registration fails completely if play services isn't the latest possible version, even if the user has it disabled. You should allow the user to click outside that popup and proceed without updating/using play services if in fact Signal works without it. That's what most apps do if they don't require play services. Second, your comment about Signal being designed to work if play services isn't installed on the device at all is completely facetious. ALL android devices have this installed. The only way to get it completely deleted is to root the device, which thanks to google, can only be done by using third-party apps like Kingroot which is made by unknown people in China and introduces a huge security risk. Therefore, it's only feasible to DISABLE play services, google services framework, the play store, and google account manager. Third, you ask what is the benefit of making play services disabled &quot;if it is some kind of malware.&quot; Well, (1) play services constantly phones home to a google domain at 1e100.net. It has complete permissions to your device and, knowing how google is, most likely uploads the user's contacts and files, and may even record audio and video without the user knowing. The mere fact that it has permission to do all of that is a security risk in itself (and opens a backdoor for the government to collude with google to develop spy tools for Android phones). (2) Play services is constantly updating, which I have found can cause major incompatibility issues and brick phones, since google doesn't test the update on every phone in use in the marketplace. Google forces the updates on users, which is unethical and unnecessary if the old version is working. So, hopefully you can see why play services is a major problem. Basically, google treats peoples' phones as if it belonged to google, controlling what can run on the device, forcing updates, accessing god knows what, and constantly phoning home, as any user with a firewall app can see. They act as if they are only &quot;licensing&quot; the phone to the user, rather than the user actually owning the phone and controlling it. Honestly, I would think any developer working on a privacy/security product like Signal would have grasped this already.

		Pardon me if this had been already discussed, but I only found one relevant issue, #838. Since TS only supports phone numbers as an identity mechanism, it means the telcos (and hence governments) have all the metadata they need to identify users. Thy don't even care about the communication contents - see Why Metadata Matters | Electronic Frontier Foundation and Using Metadata to find Paul Revere. Thus TextSecure offers a false sense of security. I'd love to be proven wrong if perhaps I misunderstood the underlying handshake and transport mechanisms (SMS, GCM).

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Since March 13, you can now download Signal as an .apk from the official website. This is partial done for people who have no Google Play installed on their devices. A part of this group does not have Google Play installed because they don't want to have proprietary software on their device. Fortunately, you can use Signal without Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging but unfortunately, the proprietary libraries are still included in Signal's build. Some of these are:     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:9.6.1'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:9.6.1'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-places:9.6.1'
 In my eyes it makes sense to add a fully free and open source gradle build flavor to Signal which builds get published on the website instead of the default Google Play release. If this is done, F-Droid can reproduce and distribute the official binaries of Signal by OpenWhisperSystems. Reference thread in F-Droid's forum: https://forum.f-droid.org/t/signal-discussion-about-google-play-alternative/95 👍 6

		I have: [ x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description [Caveat] Please note, I'm not entirely sure this is a bug, as I could see the utility of this behavior, depending on the use-case. When I'm in a group conversation with (in this case) two other users, and I've set the disappearing messages timer to 1 day, if that amount of time passes and no one has sent any messages to the group, not only will the messages disappear (as expected), but the entire group will disappear, no longer showing in the contacts list. Steps to reproduce Create a messaging group with two other Signal users Set disappearing messages timer to 1 day Exchange messages as expected Note that your group appears in your contacts list Allow all messages to expire, with no messages being sent or received by the group for the duration of the disappearing messages timer Note that the created group has disappeared Actual result: Note that the created group has disappeared Expected result: Noting my caveat above, the expected result would normally be that the created group does not disappear without the user manually deleting it. Work-arounds The following work-arounds were found to negate this behavior (assuming you don't want to disable the disappearing messages functionality): When first creating the group, prior to setting the disappearing messages timer, send one message to the group, serving to anchor the group in your contacts list. Once that message has been sent, set the disappearing messages timer, which will automatically delete subsequent messages (excluding the anchor). It is unknown if this will serve to anchor the group with recipients, especially if they manually delete the anchor. Assuming you're using the desktop client, where the group will not disappear once the timer has expired (but messages will), send a message to the group. This will serve to recreate the group on the mobile app. The group will disappear on the mobile app should the timer expire again. App State Signal messages and calls registered SMS/MMS Enabled Notifications on Passphrase on, Screen security on Theme Dark, Language Default Message trimming off 3rd party app info unknown, other than being Signal registered Device info Device: Huawei Nexus 6P Android version: 7.1.2, build N2G47H Signal version: 4.4.0 beta Link to debug log Bug(?) was not noticed in a timely fashion, so no debug log was generated.

		I have: [X ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ X] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Actually this is not a bug, just proposal for UX improvement. Current sounds (sonar sound and ping when call is established/terminated) are by my opinion too aggressive. They contain too much high tones. My proposal is, to use more soft sounds. My proposal is also to replace sonar sound with something more similar to ringing... for instance instead of sonar there should be &quot;slow&quot; ringing and when ringing starts, there should be regular ringing (as it is now). Another proposal is also to measure bandwidth and quality of call. When quality of call starts to get to low, user should get a very soft beep-beep-beep sound, so he/she is alerted there are problems with bandwidth. This should also be visible on the screen. If connection drops (because of bad connection), it should be re-establisher automatically - user should be alerted of this re-establishing by sound and by screen text. Anyway, I am also noticing some problems with bandwidth consumption. Are there any plans that when bad network conditions occur, codec automatically &quot;switches&quot; to lower quality? I am not talking about VBR codecs, just that maybe there should be two codecs used - one for normal bandwidth and another when bandwidth is lower. 👍 2 👎 2

		Signal should remember that you've verified safety numbers with a contact. When you run into a friend, it's easy to forget whether you've done this or not, and anything to make it more convenient increases security. Some users add a check mark to the contact's name, but this is a terrible solution. This change shouldn't require any new options or settings. It would be nice: for both users to see a &quot;Your safety number with XXX was verified [/ not verified]&quot; message in the conversation in the style that you already see e.g. &quot;Your safety number with XXX has changed&quot; to see an indication of whether the safety number for any given contact has been verified in &quot;Conversation settings &gt; verify safety number&quot;, and perhaps also additional info about it e.g. when verification occurred, how ... to have some ongoing visual indication of the verification status within each conversation (maybe the lock and checkmarks could become green instead of grey? or there could be a different color in the title bar or background color?) I'm guessing it's unwise, though, to prevent someone from re-verifying a safety number with a contact in case, e.g., their threat model includes physical tampering Thanks for considering this! 👍 4

Sorry if this should be monitored within #993, but as this is closed, I did not see a chance to connect this request with this issue. Regards 👍 5

		@moxie0 Thank you for finally implementing #993 with Signal version 4.5.3. You locked the #993 issue some time ago, so that I (who reported it) was unable to close it. I want to ask you to close it, and also this issue. I want to inform you that some people collected a bounty for the implementation of arbitrary-file-attachments. You now can claim the bounty (please see Bountysource page https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1464832-suggestion-allow-arbitrary-file-types-txt-zip-apk-pdf-to-be-sent-as-attachments-not-only-audio-video-media ). 👍 1

			<bugID>Issue #6613</bugID>
			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		As part of an intermediate threat level(?) model, I'd like to have - like in GO SMS Pro, for example - the passphrase-protection apply only to a subset of my contacts/conversations, which should not affect normal usage of the app for the rest of the conversations in any way. The &quot;sensitive&quot; conversations should only show up and be available to interact with when the passphrase is entered. For this to happen, of course, there needs to be an entirely different handling of the passphrase-protection (or just a new dedicated contacts-hiding passphrase mechanism?) where it doesn't auto-lock the whole app but only some conversations. In this case I should have something like an Unlock option in the Settings menu rather than as the first thing shown on app launch. The scenario I'm thinking of is probably a quite common one, where you expect to forget your phone on a table somewhere and to have people looking through it while you're gone. In that case it's not much of a problem if they can get past the lockscreen but it becomes more important that a few apps or app sections holding sensitive information be really locked down with something more complicated than what's typically available as a screen locker. (If I complicate the screen locker by making it a long PIN or passphrase I severely reduce the usability of my phone, and in my opinion it's the same with my SMS handling app, which should be able to deal with &quot;inocuous&quot; conversations quickly and easily even if I have other conversations that I want to keep under a tighter lock.) As for new message notifications from the hidden contacts, they should have some generic new-message text that doesn't disclose either the contact's name or the contents of what they've sent you. 👍 1 👎 5

		When having a call with another person via Signal they can hear me, but I can't hear them. We've tried it multiple times, over the span of a month and the issue is always the same. It doesn't matter who initiates the call either. Steps to reproduce Call or let someone else call you talk Actual result: The person on the other end can hear me perfectly fine but I don't hear anything. It's like they're completely muted (they say they're not) Device: OnePlus One Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 4.5.3 https://gist.github.com/ada14fc110c4e41798d6ad6367f64365 This is one of the few ways I can talk to this person securely (we're thouhsands of miles apart) so I'd appreciate any help. 👍 1

		Bug description When a user changes key, the &quot;safety numbers changed, accept?&quot; message appears in a private conversation with the user, even if the message was sent in a group. I observed that people find this confusing, sometimes not realizing that they're missing group messages and then blaming Signal for losing them. I know that the fact that a message is a &quot;group message&quot; is itself part of the message, and if the message is not trusted this information shouldn't be trusted too. Still I think that in this case the sweet spot between security and usability lies in showing these messages in the group conversation. Partially related: #5985. Steps to reproduce Have a group conversation One of the users changes key (reinstalls Signal) Check where the &quot;safety numbers changed, accept?&quot; warning appears. Actual result: The warning appears in a private conversation with the user. Expected result: The warning appears in the group conversation.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description These are small issues but I think they could have some impact on user experience. Here they are (in order of importance): There is too much empty space between messages from the same person. The amount of space is OK for messages from two different people but that space is too much for messages from the same person. I often express my point in several consecutive messages and the spaces are breaking the flow. Right now you could fit about two extra lines between the text of two consecutive messages. Similarly it's not necessary to display the profile picture for every message. In one-on-one chat you actually don't need the pictures at all. But I'm less sure if this is actually an issue. Actual result: a lot of space between messages which interrupts the flow of conversation Expected result: good use of space

Solution Add option for user to select where the messages, etc. will be stored. Especially with the possibility to send media, this will come in handy to offload the main storage. As an added bonus, this is a feature WhatsApp doesn't have and seems to be reluctant to implement so that would be something they don't have. 👍 2

		I have: [ x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [ x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports When two people talk at the same time (or when talking overlaps eachother) android user's voice quality goes down and voice starts to become choppy. One must wait for another to finish talking otherwise they can't hear clearly. I've tried Pixel XL into iPhone 5S, Nexus 5X into iPhone 5S. HTC One M8 to Pixel XL. All same results. Only iPhone 6s to 5s works without problems. Using relayed calls from signal servers does not help. Only the device running android gets choppy, I can always hear the iPhone user fine. Both got choppy when called from android to android. Device info Device: Pixel XL Android version: 7.1.2 Signal version: 4.6.0, 4.6.1

		I respect that Signal is trying to improve the state of secure communications and is designed in such a way as to minimize the amount of metadata available to Open Whisper Systems, but because it is not a federated protocol, all Signal users must trust that Open Whisper Systems is telling the truth. While we have no reason to doubt that, it would be better not to have to operate solely on trust. There should be no downside to making Signal's servers world-readable (except for API keys, of course) so that users can verify for themselves that all messages are encrypted and minimal metadata are stored.

		What An option allowing the user to choose how messages should be sent. For encrypted chat all 3 options would be available. For unencrypted chat only SMS would be available. Why A person has ran out of data --&gt; SMS has ran out of free texts --&gt; data doesn't care --&gt; both wants more control has a good package and can use both at any time I haven't read up on the protocol, but I assume the encryption is end to end and since this once was called TextSecure, encrypted texts should still be possible.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Well the problem i have is some contacts hav tested Signal (on iOS) but have stoped useing the app. Signal stil expect them to use Signal. Since on my P9 I use Signal for all communiction SMS get to Signal conversation flow. If the contact that have passively abadoned signal write an SMS it gets listed and Signal defaults to send them an answer over data service, which the doesent reach the Phone of the SMS message received before. This is very bad. Moste of the time I am aware the person doesnt use Signal and chose SMS to sen dthe message but sometimes I forget it and the to be receiving person is going to be upset because she doesn't receive an answer. Steps to reproduce register mobile number A for signal delete app from phone of user A send an SMS from user A to B B uses Signal Android as SMS App B receives SMS message insecure B knows A has removed Signal from phone and wants to write back but forgets to choose SMS for sending the message A doesn't receive the message because it never contacts the server Actual result: contact doesn't receive an answer Expected result: Either the receiver should get the message over the way he sent it to the receiver or the sender should be made aware the receiver probably doesn't uses signal anymore or sms should be a default option to chose from in contact setting There are some workaround for this drop SMS on Android app altogether (which is a no brainier in myy eyes) make trafic type selection permanent, in user settings, which would just wire up some available functions as defaults (workaround) implement active database , eg a number doesn't communicate once in a (to be defined, weeks/months ) timeframe to the server (connect to server not sending receiving a message) either drop the number from Secure user circle or notify the sender of a data message the chat partner has seen no data usage recently and my not receive the message in time (optimal, but provides probably meta data leak) Device info Device: HUaweii P9 to iPhone 6 Android version: 7.0.0 Signal version: All until to date as of writing 👍 3

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description I installed a different ROM for my phone and made a backup of my conversations. After installing the ROM I registered my device and tried to restore the backup. That seemed to work fine but on closer inspection it turned out that group chats had been split into separate conversations, one for each person in the chat. So, for example, if I was in a group chat with Tom and Jerry, I would now have one chat with Tom (with all messages he sent to the group) and one for Jerry (with his messages). The group chat was not restored at all. Steps to reproduce Use Signal like normal (I did use a custom build with layout changes I've been working on with my own signing key, version 4.6.0), participate in group chats Create a backup in Signal Install a custom ROM (Lineage OS in my case). I wiped everything like system, cache, etc, except the internal storage (data) partition. Reinstall Signal Import the backup you've created earlier Actual result: Group chats are imported as separate chats for each person participating in the chat. Expected result: Group chats should be restored the way I backed them up, so all the messages from that group should appear in that group chat. Screenshots Omitted because privacy and I don't have photoshop at hand to do some blurring. Device info Device: Moto X 2014 (victara) xt1092 Android version: 6.0.0 (stock moto) -&gt; 7.1.2 lineage os nightly june 2nd Signal version: 4.6.0 / 4.6.1 Link to debug log Sorry, don't have that.. 👍 2

		I'm attempting to verify the download on your official channel: https://whispersystems.org/android/apk/ The sha256 hash of the downloaded APK doesn't match the fingerprint posted on the website 29:F3:4E:5F:27:F2:11:B4:24:BC:5B:F9:D6:71:62:C0 EA:FB:A2:DA:35:AF:35:C1:64:16:FC:44:62:76:BA:26 The instructions are unclear, does the above hash correspond to a simple hash of the .apk file, or do I need OWS's public key? It's not immediately obvious where to find it. A better setup would be to host an F-Droid repo so you could push prompt, secure updates to your users using an alternative download channel. Thanks :) 👍 2

		Quite often when &quot;sharing&quot; a clipboard (text) with the Signal App I noticed that the text is inappropriate or more simply, I decided not to send this text. I have to mark and delete the text. It would be easier, if the text input has a button(marked with &quot;X&quot; or a delete symbol), so that the text could be quickly deleted by clicking the button or symbol.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When using the desktop app, when a person sends me a message, the chat window jumps to a section of disappearing messages from a week ago. The disappearing timer was set to five minutes. The messages disappeared from my phone correctly, but they are still visible on my computer. The messages have also disappeared on the phone and computer of the account that they were sent to. Steps to reproduce Unfortunately, I have never seen this before, so I am not exactly sure of the steps to reproduce it. Here are the repro steps from my end that made this happen: Send messages from Android (OnePlus 3T phone, Signal v 4.6.1) Messages were received on Android (Google Nexus 5 phone) Use Signal Desktop a week later on a Mac (macOS Sierra 10.12.5, Chrome 58.0.3029.110) Actual result: Messages that were supposed to disappear are still visible Expected result: Secure messages should disappear from all devices Screenshots In the screenshot you can see the text about turning on and off disappearing messages but also the timestamp showing that the messages occurred last Monday: Device info Computer: Device: Macbook Pro, macOS Sierra 10.12.5, Chrome 58.0.3029.110 Android version: 7.1.1 Signal version: 4.6.1 Link to debug log The desktop app doesn't seem to provide debug logs. I can provide one from my phone, if that will be useful, but the bug doesn't appear on my phone. 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description A contact of mine unregistered recently. I decided to check and see if Signal would now default to sending that contact SMS. Upon opening the contact's conversation view, the application crashed. While reproducing the issue to produce a log, it seems it has worsened, and now Signal crashes on launch, rendering it completely unusable. I think this is caused by having an existing encrypted conversation with the contact. Looking at the logs, it appears that the identity information is deleted after the user unregisters, but it still tries to access the identity information to decrypt the existing messages. I haven't looked at the relevant code yet, so this is just a guess. Steps to reproduce contact unregisters from Signal go to their conversation view app crashes Actual result: Signal crashes. Expected result: Signal should not crash. Device info Device: Huwai Nexus 6P Android version: 7.1.2 Signal version: latest master Link to debug log I can't open Signal to capture a log without it crashing, but here's a snippet from logcat: https://paste.ee/p/1iAC5

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Marking a contact as verified or unverified generates a status message in each conversation the contact is in. But both actions are manually and deliberately carried out by the user, so I think that one status message in the one-to-one conversation is enough. Steps to reproduce choose a contact that is member of several groups mark that contact as verified check the conversation list Actual result: All conversations that the contact is in have a new status message and thus jump to the top of the conversation list, however old the group conversation may have been Expected result: Only show a status message in the one-to-one conversation Maybe it would still be somewhat helpful to generate a status message in a group once all group members have been verified.

		As I didn't understand what the &quot;Safety numbers approval&quot; switch really does, and the blog post does not mention it, I tried to look it up in the source code. It seems to me that isSendingIdentityApprovalRequired() is not called anywhere. I guess that the idea is: when the switch is turned on, then approval is always required when sending, without taking into account if the sender had the opportunity to see the safety number change warning. The receiving behavior doesn't change. This is not clear from the interface, a better description of the switch could be something like: &quot;Require approval of safety numbers changes for unverified contacts&quot; Device info Signal version: 4.7.0

		So here is the idea: now that we have persistent identity verification, an SMS based safety number verification can be implemented. Of course this is not as good as a face-to-face meeting where the numbers are checked, but the only way to perform a MITM is to control both the Signal server and the mobile carrier, in order to manipulate the SMS message exchange. This is very unlikely (remember that the SSL certificate of the server is pinned). I think that an attack of this kind is less likely than getting the device compromised. In this case encryption is not of any help.

		Backgrund: PR #6731. This could be automated like this: The QR code contains the safety number and a random password, valid only while the QR code page is open; Device A scans Device B's QR code, checks the number, marks it as &quot;verified&quot; and sends an acknowledgement message to device B, authenticated by the temporary password; If the password matches, device B sets the number as verified too, as the acknowledgement message can only come from a device that physically scanned the QR code. #1016 deserves some love too.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description The size of the share menu is smaller than the keyboard. I know this depends upon the height chosen for the keyboard but the menu is smaller than the &quot;normal&quot; setting and this makes the keyboard jut out behind the menu when the menu is accessed with the keyboard already open. Is there anyway the menu could scale with the keyboard or could it just be made larger than it is now? Or maybe the keyboard could be minimised/hidden whenever the share menu is accessed? Steps to reproduce Tap on the text field to pull up the keyboard Tap on the share button to show the share menu Actual result: The top of the keyboard is visible behind the share menu Expected result: Keyboard should either be hidden or menu should be larger than keyboard so that the keyboard isn't seen Screenshots Keyboard Open Share menu also opened. The black bar between the text field and the menu is what I'm talking about. Device info Device: OnePlus One Android version: 7.1.2 Signal version: 4.7.3

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Repro: On Signal Desktop, open a chat without disappearing messages set Click the 3 dots button and click &quot;Disappearing messages&quot; This sets the timer to 1 day. This is a problem because if I want 1 week I now have accidentally deleted 6 days of messages (I presume). Even if that is not the case it looks like it might be. It's confusing and suggests possible data loss. Not sure what the best solution is. As a user I'd be happy if clicking the menu item merely made the disappearing messages button visible but set to off. I can then directly set the desired choice. (Also, can we have a few more choices between 1 day and 1 week and also 1 month?) Device info Android version: 7.1 Windows version: 7 x64 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports I have some people in my contact list that have uninstalled Signal, but didn't do a proper unregistration so my Signal app always defaults to sending them Signal messages, which they never receive. I have to manually select &quot;SMS mode&quot; each time I open the conversation. It would be great if the last used way of contacting a specific contact was remembered by the app.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports When the message is sent, the first tick acknowledges that the message was sent correctly and if there is an error, the notification alerting the user appears after some time. The second tick acknowledges the correct reception of the message and it would be great to have an option to notify the user if message is not received even after some time (a few days for example). It usually indicates dead phone or battery, that the recepient is no longer available on Signal, wrong recepient, or even some exotic bug in the system, etc. Therefore it would be very practical to have a notification popping up alerting the user that message hasn't been received even after some time. I also suggest this time be adjustable and 1 day as the default setting.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal uses over half a gigabyte of &quot;data&quot; for seemingly no reason. See the picture. Steps to reproduce Honestly I wish I knew. I've had my phone for about 7 months now (Since last Christmas) and I've been using the same install of Signal all this time. This morning I look at Signal's storage usage and I discover it's using waaaaaaay more than it should. I have the SD timer set to 12 hours on 2 chats and 24 hours on 1 chat. I've tried deleting my 3 chats to see if that would help. It didn't. Actual result: It seems Signal isn't properly deleting attachments or something. Expected result: Signal shouldn't use half a gigabyte of my phone's memory unless I got half a gigabyte of attachments in my conversations. I don't.

		When a contact doesn't use signal anymore, we should have the option to move back to sms.

		Steps to reproduce Have a member of a group unsubscribe from Signal Check how the now unsubscribed number is still part of the group Now the stale number is impossible to remove from the group. Sometimes re-registering is not an option, as access to the number might have been lost. Most of the time the user just doesn't care. Expected result: The unsubscribed user is automatically removed from all the groups. I know the server is not aware of groups, but I think there are still ways to handle this. For example: When sending a message to a group (i.e., to all the group members), if a user is not a Signal user anymore, remove it; Before adding a user to a group because of a message coming from another group member, check if the number is actually a Signal number.

		searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports I installed the Signal apk, from the WhisperSystems website (Signal 4.7.4), on Android-X86 in a virtual machine and linked it with the Chromium app, so far so good. Even so the linking process worked pretty fine, it turned out that all the other functionality in Signal-on-Android-x86 isn't working at all (like sending text messages or esp. calling other signal users). That is probably because Android-x86 (in a Virtualbox) uses the LAN interface (NIC) (to connect to the internet) and it seems like the Signal-Android-app expects a WiFi connection instead of a LAN connection. Could you please try to find a solution, so that people could use the Signal-Android-App on Android-x86 to call their contacts (of course a solution for the Signal-Chromium-Desktop-App would be preferable ;) )?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description The current isLowMemory code suboptimally uses getMemoryClass instead of getLargeMemoryClass. Since Signal already sets android:largeHeap, the relevant limit is returned by getLargeMemoryClass, as per the Android documentation. I think this is behind the effect where some devices can easily send higher resolution images over other messaging apps (e.g. Whatsapp) but get a rather low memory class rating in Signal and compress the images too much as a result.

On an earlier version of Signal, this worked as expected. With the current version (4.8.1) however, this is no longer possible and all messages and texts show incorrect information. Additionally, I cannot find the setting in the preferences anymore Steps to reproduce have no network connection for some time restore network connection receive message that was sent while you were unavailable open the message's detailed information Actual result: The message was allegedly sent only seconds prior to the reception (which is wrong) Expected result: The &quot;sent&quot; time should be correct, i.e. when the sender sent the message.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal APK on website (and likely via Google Play store) is signed with cert that uses a RSA1024 key with SHA1 digest. Unsure if this is actually an issue as it seems likely that you would be aware already but since I couldn't find a prior issue I thought I should raise it. My instinct tells me that changing to a &gt;=2048bit key would break update functionality as the signing certificate digest is pinned in the app. Better safe than sorry to raise this anyway, Livvy Steps to reproduce jarsigner -verify -certs -verbose Signal-website-release-4.8.1.apk Actual result: Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) - Signed by &quot;CN=Whisper Systems, OU=Research and Development, O=Whisper Systems, L=Pittsburgh, ST=PA, C=US&quot;
    Digest algorithm: SHA1
    Signature algorithm: SHA1withRSA, 1024-bit key

jar verified.
 Expected result: Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) Not necessarily a bug report so not necessarily an &quot;expected&quot; result but in an ideal world: - Signed by &quot;CN=Whisper Systems, OU=Research and Development, O=Whisper Systems, L=Pittsburgh, ST=PA, C=US&quot;

I can stare at my whole contact list, but when i click on someone to enter the conversation it crashes 100% of the time. I can't do a debug because it keeps crashing during the debug. :S Steps to reproduce Install CopperheadOS on Nexus 5X Install Signal apk Try use Signal normally Actual result: Crashes, displays 'Signal has stopped'.

Currently, can only search for contact names on the main Signal screen when you first open the app/after login which shows the list of conversations. Would love either a global in-thread search so I can search for all instances of a string or word (and perhaps other search operators that can search for the existence of &quot;attachments&quot; or even date-ranges?) across all the saved conversations on the phone, or at minimum a search function within a single thread.

		Hi, I'm using Signal Desktop on macOS Sierra. Whenever I exit Signal and Chrome is still running, Signal actually doesn't exit. Which I find rather annoying. When someone sends messages, I always get notified. I don't understand why the app doesn't actually shut down. It really annoying and I think it's a matter of security, in my opinion, if I think if direct physical access/people peeking over your shoulder. No that I think about it, runs nontheless whenever I simply start Chrome. So I can't use Chrome without actually using Signal.

		Bug description While registered with Signal on a foreign number, and visiting UAE, Signal does not work so whilst de-registration of foreign number, messages that were not being sent/received are suddenly sent/received in that time window. Is there a possible vulnerability just during that time frame? Steps to reproduce Use a SIM card from a foreign country where Signal is not blocked or censored and register and use it in that country. Go to UAE and use Signal (messages will not be sent) Send a few messages and instantly go to next step Try de-registering (it will give an error of &quot;error connecting to server&quot;) Previously sent messages will be delivered whilst the de-registration is happening Messages will not be sent anymore afterwards and de-registration won't happen. Messages sent from outside UAE are also not delivered normally, but are received whilst the UAE user is de-registering. Actual result: So messages are not being sent/received at all.... but then when trying to de-register the messages are sent/received. The main problem here is that during de-registration all messages are sent/received. Expected result: Not sure what I expect, but if Signal is blocked then messages shouldn't go through at all. So maybe it is a security issue, or perhaps there is another way to circumvent censorship? Screenshots Sorry no screenshots as the explanation is self-sufficient (hopefully).

		I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates Bug description Scenario: Someone is using Signal, then switches to a new phone but doesn’t reinstall/re-set up Signal. Issue: I send them a text message through Signal. The lock symbol appears (so the message is being routed through Signal), the first checkmark (the message was sent) appears, but I never get the second checkmark (the message was delivered). I've run into this issue with at least 3 people in the last week. In addition to the problem itself, it is additionally problematic that there is no notification the message was never delivered. I only discover it when I go to text that person again days, or weeks later - and even then it often takes me a few more instances before I notice what's going on. Steps to reproduce Set up Signal on a phone. Drop phone in toilet. Get a new phone, don't set up Signal. Have someone else send you a text message. Actual result: The recipient does not receive any message. The sender does not receive a notification their message failed to deliver. Expected result: Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) The text message would be routed to the recipient's normal text message app, OR... The sender would be notified the text message could not be delivered. Platform info Operating System: LG G6, Android 7.0. Signal version: 4.9.9

Even deleting the draft doesn't delete the file. Actual result: A file with a jpg extension is created in the folder /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.thoughcrime.securesms/files - the file name is made of the digits of what appears to be ctime of the time the file was created. The file persists throughout the life of the app and never deleted, even when the image in the conversation is deleted or the entire conversation is deleted. Clearing Signal's storage from the app info applet does delete all files in that folder. Expected result: Ideally, No plaintext image file would be created anywhere within the phone's file system Alternatively, the file will be deleted as soon as practicable after it has been encrypted and stored in Signal's database Device info Device: Tested on OnePlus 2 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Android version: Tested under OxygenOS Stock 3.6.0 for Oneplus 2 and Cyanogen 14.1 NIGHTLY for S7 Signal version: 4.9.9 and, based on the pictures left on my device, multiple previous versions 👍 7

		[x ] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates Bug description I have a bunch of &quot;Unknown Group&quot;s at the bottom of my list in the desktop app. This happened after the upgrade to Android Signal 4.10.3, so not sure yet if this is bad interpretation by desktop or just a matter of garbage in, garbage out because of what the new Android client sent. Filed here per comments by @scottnonnenberg in WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop#1449 Steps to reproduce Have MMS conversations (non-signal. Mine included some members who were signal users, but not all, so it was normal MMS) Upgrade Android client from 4.9.9 -&gt; 4.10.3 Actual result: End up with a bunch of &quot;Uknown Group&quot;s and when you look at the phone #'s, you'll see numbers that are NOT signal users Expected result: Only Signal-only groups get imported into the desktop client Screenshots Platform info Operating System: Win 7 Browser: Chrome 61.0.3163.79 Signal version: Android 4.10.3 / Desktop 0.43.2 Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/080ad052cc62329207191644106ff718

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Feature request description: I would love to see an option (or default behaviour) for status info about setting timers for disappearing messages to vanish from a conversation as well. Reason: If one has the need for using disappearing messages it seems very likely this person does not want anyone to know that there was any exchange of communication at the time. Actual result: If I switch between different timer settings, all of them get listed in the conversation. So if anyone is eavesdropping on my conversation, it might be suspicious to see that information and that could lead to questioning. Expected result: After a 'hidden' conversation disappered, the info about it should disappear as well. Device info All devices, all Signal versions up till now. 👍 1

My phone asked if I still want to allow that, but even when pressing deny the question came back. As this rendered my phone useless, I made a restart. The problem came back after the restart. I switched back to the default SMS app, and this has not happened since. (The problem never appeared either before.) Steps to reproduce I have no clue. Never happened before and since.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When using a dual SIM Android phone, un-encrypted text messages (SMS) are sent from the primary SIM card even when all received text messages from this contact were received by the secondary SIM. Steps to reproduce SIM1 is the primary SIM with the data connection. SIM2 is the secondary SIM without data connection. In my case, Signal was registered using the number of SIM2. However, sending/receiving encrypted messages via SIM1 only works flawlessly, thanks! open existing conversation of a contact which does not use Signal (yet) this contact does only know my SIM2 number and thus, the whole conversation so far was written to and sent by my SIM2 send an un-encrypted text message without manually switching the send-button to SIM2; SIM1 is always selected and used by default Actual result: the contact gets my message from my SIM1 phone number which she did not recognize my text message gets misinterpreted as spam which results in a failed conversation Expected result: my text message gets sent via SIM2 (as before) and my contact recognizes my number IMHO, this can be accomplished in two ways: Signal asks me once (per un-encrypted conversation) which SIM I want to use for this contact This can be modified in the conversation settings Signal analyses the conversation so far and if (a) every or (b) the most recent ones or (c) the previous message was sent from SIM2, use SIM2 as long as I manually don't switch the SIM for this conversation. I'd go with 2. (c) because it seems to be the most intuitive solution without additional UI elements for switching default SIM in the conversation settings.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Signal crashes with the &quot;Signal&quot; has stopped unexpectedly when opening a group on Jolla/Alien Dalvik. It looks to me that this happend due to a method missing in that implemementation. Configuration.getLayoutDirection() is API level 17 while the actual Aliend Dalvik provides Android 4.1.2 with API level 16. So this is is no bug in Signal but having a workaround would help Jolla users to use vanilla Signal on their device. Steps to reproduce Start signal Open a group Actual result: Signal crashes with the message &quot;Signal&quot; has stopped unexpectedly Expected result: Group should open as they did with Signal 4.9.5 Device info Device: Jolla (alien_jolla_bionic) Android version: 4.1.2 (Alien Dalvik) Signal version: 4.10.11 Debug log Device  : unknown Jolla (alien_jolla_bionic)

		On other messaging apps, the typical behavior within a conversation that includes multiple media files such as images, is to allow swiping left/right to the previous/next one. If multiple images are shared in a conversation, that makes it much easier to go through them all without leaving fullscreen. In Signal if, let's say, 5 images are shared in a row, you need to open them individually, then go back, open the next one and repeat until done.

Tapping on the message brings up a prompt with two options: CANCEL MAKE VISIBLE Tapping cancel does not make the prompt at the top of the chat go away and I do not wish to share my details in the chat. Steps to reproduce Update to the latest version of Signal Open group chat, you should see a blue prompt at the top of the chat Tap on the prompt Tap on &quot;CANCEL&quot; Actual result: The popup disappears but leaves the prompt at the top of the screen.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Describe here the issue that you are experiencing. My old phone broke, and I got lent one by a friend, Samsung S3 (model GT-I9300), running CyanogenMod (11.0-InstallerXNPQ32P) with android 4.4.4 which is old but they asked me not to reflash it as it had some tools that were hard to set up and worked which they didn't want breaking. The google play framework was out of date, so couldn't install via the play store, instead getting the apk from https://signal.org/android/apk/ and installing it. I have swapped sims from old phone, and started up signal, registered and sent test message to my friend which worked, they could send one back and that worked. Later I asked someone from a group chat I was in to send a message to the group, and it came through, but now everytime I open the app it crashes with the stack trace shown below. I get notifications fine, but whenever I go into the app it crashes. I cleared data and reinstalled the apk and it still does this repeatably. It also has xposed framework on it, but I couldn't see how to disable that so unsure if it is interfering. I'm just wondering whether this would be an issue with: signal old cyanogen old gapps xposed Attached the logs below, let me know if you need more than that. Steps to reproduce Have a group chat on one phone Register a new device running outdated software? Receive a group chat message Actual result: Crash Expected result: Signal works as normal, can view group chat messages, no crash.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description In most of the groups all members are in my contacts already (e.g. close friends). I am never asked to make my profile visible to any of those users individually, because they are in my contacts. But now in those groups I am asked to do this explicitly. It would be nice if I would not see this banner as long as there are only contacts in this group. Steps to reproduce someone else creates a group where all members are already in your contacts Actual result: Banner requests to make profile visible. Expected result: I already made my profile visible to all group members individually (e.g. automatically), so the banner should not be there. P.S.: The &quot;contact verified&quot; flag could also be used to decide that a profile should be made visible automatically. Device info Signal version: 4.11.0 👍 3

		This is an usability issue: the read receipts feature is not clear. What should I expect? A triple tick mark then the recipient read the message? A change in color in the tick marks? Or will the second tick mark appear only if the message has been read (so if I disable read receipts, I won't know if a message has been delivered)? How can I tell if a contact disabled the read receipts, or if s/he actually didn't read my messages?

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Not really sure how to report this. I deem that it belongs here since it is not a support request, and is an issue with Signal. But it it is considerably more general than other bug reports. I have read all of the issue tickets reporting issues with the new profile feature, and all of them identify issues with the way the feature was implemented. None of them speak to the addition of this feature itself as problematic. I use Signal because it is still the project with the most diligent commitment to smartphone messaging privacy. I have until now had high confidence that Signal development decisions would be smart and levelheaded, and would not compromise my privacy. The addition of the profile feature has shaken that confidence. The announcement of the Profile feature in Beta, which I've only now had a chance to read, claims &quot;All of this is possible without sacrificing the privacy and security that you have come to expect from Signal.&quot; This is not true. Half of my contacts know me by one name, half by another. It is imperative that there is no crossover between these identities. Furthermore, the gmail account my Android phone is registered under is a third identity. Disclosing that identity to some Signal contacts would represent a catastrophic privacy breach, which could even, hypothetically, endanger my life. Up until now, there has been no cause for concern in using Signal, as enforcing the segregation of these identities has presented no issues. Signal's design decisions have never presented any threat to this segregation, because the presumption has always been in favour of privacy. The &quot;set up your profile&quot; wizard which announced itself after the update prepopulated the name field with the name associated with my Google account. It would have been very easy to have accidentally accepted this as my profile name. As per the Signal blogpost, this name would then have been visible to all contacts saved in my phone. This decision thoughtlessly left me a single mistake away from a catastrophic privacy breach. The &quot;Do It Later&quot; option was minuscule and dangerously close in the UI to the very large &quot;Accept&quot; button. It was initially not visible to me, so it looked as if I was being forced to choose a unitary identity for a Signal instance where I was managing multiple identities. When I did spot it, after a reinstall, several attempts to press it on my large smartphone screen were unsuccessful. It took multiple attempts. Before I discovered the &quot;Do it later&quot; option, my compromise attempt to save an empty profile returned an error message. I also discovered, after temporarily choosing a privacy-preserving pseudonymous profile name (which would nevertheless appear highly incongruous to several of my contacts) that it is not possible to delete an identity once chosen. There is no option to do so, and if you try to save an empty profile it gives you an error. So I had to reinstall the app to delete my profile. And when you do not set up a profile, the app harrasses you with persistent notifications to do so during group conversations, as if the decision not to is assumed to be a temporary one by the Signal devs. There are several bug reports which suggests mitigations for some of these different problems (although not all of them - e.g. I have seen no mention of the prepopulation of the name field as a concern). Fixing each of these problems would indeed have reduced the severity of the threat to privacy represented by the introduction of the feature. (I also imagine there are people who believe that simply adding support for multiple profiles would solve the issue, but in my opinion this would drastically sophisticate the task of managing identities, and result in accidental breaches.) But fixing each of those issues would not address what seems to me the major issue: that this issue was so thoughtlessly introduced at all. Yes, it is clear that - to preserve my privacy - Signal devs decided it would be unwise to just automatically create a profile for me based on the name associated with my Gmail account. Instead I was given a dialogue with the name prepopulated. But this in itself was dangerous, and the fact that I was subjected to even this danger with apparently no consideration of how it could affect people with multiple identities leaves me with little confidence that similar or worse breaches might be thoughtlessly created in the future, in order to introduce some convenience feature which is secondary to the goal of a truly private messaging application. Using Signal is now fraught with inherent risk, and I am no longer confident that Signal devs have my privacy as their priority. For me - a Signal user whose privacy is paramount - this profile feature is not a feature but a bug. The utility added to the app by the profile feature, eliminating unknown phone numbers in group conversations, seems to address an edge case at best. It does not enhance the privacy of the user - its only effect on user privacy is to make privacy compromise more likely. I cannot see how its addition necessitates the attendant complexification of the task of staying private while using the app. And the reasoning behind its introduction, in a dev team with a commitment to privacy, is entirely opaque to me. I submit this issue as a Signal user who values privacy, and who has experienced a privacy scare because of Signal development decisions - something which I am sure should be of concern to a privacy-oriented project. It is considerably longer than a typical bug report, because it speaks to a broader issue. If this issue can be taken on and used to improve matters, that is to the good. If it is simply the case that Signal is reprioritising, or that it does not intend to cater to users like me with harder privacy requirements than the average (but privacy-conscious) user, that is sad to me, but I accept it. But it also suggests to me that it is misleading to call it Signal Private Messenger, and to entice users with more stringent needs into a potentially risky situation. 👍 1 👎 1

		Not really a bug, and sorry if this is already a thing somewhere in the issues, but right now, if someone had Signal on an iphone, and got rid of it, the android app doesn't pick up on it automatically, and you have to manually send them &quot;insecure&quot; texts by holding down the send button first. A way to just select unsecure as a default, or perhaps a conversation setting that tells signal to just send regular old messages until changed in the future, would be great. Thanks.

		This discussion really applies to the entire Signal stack, but it had to put someplace. Also, I'm not entirely sure signal doesn't already have something like this. Signal does a great job at client e2e encryption. People mostly seem excited about it's ability to prevent people from listening in on conversations. Aside from encryption GPG also gives us verification that the message originated from a specific individual. I'm curious, what is that verification was taken one step further? What if a blockchain (of sorts) was kept for each conversation? This way, we enforce the order in which messages were sent and most importantly that message b came directly after message a. Deletion or insertion of messages after the fact would not be possible. Such an implementation would ensure a conversation remains the same between all parties involved and that no individual could inject or remove parts of conversations without the other parties involved noticing. An example of something like this is how git handles commits. Each commit contains a hash of the current commit (and diff) and the hash of the previous commit. A simple program can then run against the commits to verify the repo is in good order. In Signal's case, a central authority would be necessary. So the hash chain would probably need to exist on the server. The clients can sync against the hash chain and verify their local conversations match the server's. Thoughts?

I waited a few minutes until I hard rebooted the phone. After booting, the regular &quot;Enter PIN&quot; screen + background was displayed shortly, then again the background changed to the boot animation and the device became unresponsive to touchscreen input. A few seconds later the background changed to black. I rebooted several times, wiped cache and Dalvik cache from CWM, but to no avail. I finally did a factory reset, after which the phone worked normally again. Assuming the issue wasn't due to this specific update, I later reinstalled Signal from the Play Store, which resulted in a broken system all over again.

		If you use Signal for Android as an SMS client, you have to look at your phone to read the SMS, even if you have a Signal Desktop paired with the Android. It'd be great if there was a way to configure Signal for Android to automatically proxy SMS messages to/from Signal Desktop. I'm told iMessages does this as well.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When Signal is used as an SMS client, it is frustrating for the user and the recipient of messages in which the recipient has Signal installed but is still using SMS. Many of my contacts have signal installed but still use SMS separately, or use iPhones where they cannot use signal for SMS. When a Signal contact sends me an SMS message, the Signal default is to respond via a Signal message, which is confusing for the other party and inconvenient for the user, who has to remember to change the mode to SMS. This discourages users from using Signal as their SMS client. Steps to reproduce Receive an SMS from a phone number registered with Signal. Actual result: The user responds with a Signal message, which may appear differently on the recipient's device and cause confusion. Expected result: The Signal app should either match the sender's mode of communication (perhaps with a warning about encryption) OR remember the user's preference for that contact across restarts of the app. Screenshots Friend sends an SMS. I reply in Signal without realizing, then re-reply via SMS. Friend sends an SMS. I remember to change the send-mode to SMS, but after an app restart the app is back to the default of sending Signal messages.

Please provide a way to just see a short, simple indication that there are no new messages. Perhaps &quot;There are no new messages.&quot; With the link for seeing archived messages. 👎 1

		Pretty sure this is a dupe but I'm too tired to share and to annoyed that it's now difficult to share to my Bitmoji only group chat. With a recent update (4.13.6), there's now a new list of conversations that shows up when you're sharing content from another app. With the old behavior you got a list of conversations in order of last received/sent. In the new version you first get your to five last received/sent conversations, then a list of all your contacts. If you would like to share this content with a group that isn't in your top 5, it will now show up in that following contacts list. You'll have to go and send a message to the group separately so that it then shows up in that list. Again I'm half asleep and slightly intoxicated. My apologies if this is a duplicate.

		It'd be great if Signal had less G$$gle dependencies, so after the GCM-free version, location sharing without G$$gle Maps would be great. There is a small messenger out there named Kontalk which implemented this feature some time ago, maybe you can take some code from their GitHub to make it less effort: https://github.com/kontalk/androidclient 👍 1

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When I open some old 1:1 conversations from the conversation list I get the message &quot;The sender is not in your contact list&quot;. These persons are in my contact list though and if I check my contact list, Signal is listed in the &quot;connected via&quot; list. Also some of them are part of Signal groups that I do use regularly. It can easily be resolved by choosing the &quot;Add to contacts&quot; option and then directly go back to Signal, without actually adding the contact so it's not a major issue however it's a bit confusing. Attached a logfile from the moment I opened a conversation and got the &quot;Sender not in contact list&quot; message. Just to specify 'old' :-) Conversations older then September show this behavior. Steps to reproduce Open old conversation Actual result: Some contacts are reported not to be in the contact list when they actually are. Expected result: Don't get &quot;sender not in contact list&quot; message for contacts that are in the contact list.

I'm not having sms enabled in Signal however by long pressing the paperclip icon in a conversation I can send an sms. Since 4.14 would support permissions I thought, let's disable the sms permissions for Signal and send an sms by long pressing the paperclip. As a result I got the message &quot;Signal stopped&quot; and it cannot be started again. I first had to enable the sms permissions before I was able to start Signal again. Steps to reproduce Disable sms permissions for Signal In a conversation long press the paperclip so you can send an unsecured sms Send unsecured sms message Actual result: Signal crashes Expected result: After selecting unsecured sms in a conversation I would expect Signal to request the sms permission and after excepting it I would be able to send an sms or if I denied it sms would not be possible.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description Android app is unable to send messages, open the &quot;link devices&quot; option in settings, or even deregister. Messages are received upon a reboot. Chrome app on desktop continues to work fine. Steps I took Earlier today, everything was fine, and I was chatting away happily via my Android device. I then chatted a bit via the app on my desktop. Walked away from my computer and opened up the Android app again and tried to send a message, but it failed. Attempted to retry, and it failed again. Went back to my computer, and sent a message via the desktop. It was received fine. Got a reply as well. Everything seemed fine from the desktop perspective, but none of the messages were received on my phone. Attempted to open the &quot;linked devices&quot; list and I get a &quot;Network connection failed&quot; error dialog. Attempted to deregister the device, as per https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/216948747-What-do-I-do-if-I-see-Network-connection-failed-, and I get &quot;Error connecting to server!&quot; popping up in the middle-bottom of the screen briefly. Rebooted phone, opened Signal, and the intervening messages all were delivered. Repeated above steps and no messages arrived on my phone and none could be sent. Actual result: The Android app only receives messages after a reboot, and cannot send messages, manage linked devices, or deregister. Expected result: The Android app should be able to send and receive messages normally, open and manage the list of linked devices, and deregister if desired. Note: I'm &quot;still&quot; using the Chrome app on this desktop, having never migrated because the standalone app's GTK usage doesn't play well with my KDE theme or DPI settings. I do have the standalone app installed on another desktop PC (which is how I became aware of the GTK-related problems), and the Chrome app configured on a ChromeOS laptop (which obviously couldn't run the standalone app even if I wanted to there), but I haven't had a chance yet to see if they are also still working.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description After recent problem with new version of Signal (#7171), I had to downgrade. Since then I had a permanent notification of pending update, which was quite inconvenient, as on locked screen it looks exactly the same as a new message. It would be great if there will be a way to disable update notification. Regarding the self-updates notification I wonder about what has changed since #127, where @moxie0 commented that distributing apk only through Play: does not encourage the average user to tick &quot;allow 3rd party APKs&quot; in Android settings. and now Signal updates requires exactly that? Steps to reproduce Install older version of Signal View the update notification Lock screen(with option to hide notification contents)

		Signal offers an offline SMS service, however, when the recipient has a Signal account, I can only send encrypted messages through a WiFi network. It would be preferable if I can still send offline even if there is no encryption. Probably adding a warning might help. This is an issue as Signal will replace the current SMS app to be the default one.

		This may sound (and even be) overly paranoid, but the most advanced encryption in the world is meaningless if using an input method like Google Keyboard, with system-wide microphone access and other permissions. Tonight I had Signal open while watching a discussion on vegetarianism and magically I had a msg populated with &quot;I would die I was sick of being hungry I was sick of beans and rice&quot;. I DID NOT write this, or ever discuss this topic with the contact. Perhaps it's just a random coincidence, but it sounds quite a bit like the endless reports alleging Facebook listening in and serving ads based on ambient audio. Regardless if it's a real security concern, it could be a potential one,. A few ideas: Have the option for Signal to use it's own built in keyboard, similar to those meant to circumvent keyloggers. There are apps like Microphone Block and Camera Block for Android which disable the microphone and camera on a system wide basis. Replicating this functionality in Signal for a &quot;Get Smart: Super Paranoia Cone of Silence Mode&quot; would be a great addition for those that trust Signal/OWS, but maybe not Google Keyboard/Android. This still obviously isn't a 100% guarantee, but could help shift the balance from ubiquitous surveillance to highly targeted surveillance (where it should be, and all we can realistically hope for)...

		Hi there, my father has traveled (from Gemany) to Egypt vor vacation. Although he has a working data connection, my messages over Signal are not delivered (single check marks only). It looks like domain fronting does not turn on. Just my assumption... (Btw. displaying connection state and in addition domain fronting on/off would be great.) I am not sure what exact Signal version he is using. But I suppose one of the latest few (non-beta) releases. 👍 1

This makes it hard to share a message with a group, especially if it has an attachment. Steps to reproduce Make sure some conversations and groups exist Select a message and try to forward it to a group. Actual result: Groups only appear in the following lists under &quot;recent conversations&quot;. This means, if the group does has no recent messages, it cannot be selected here. Also, the search functionality does not find groups in this activity. Expected result: I'd expect groups to appear in the contacts list as well and that they can be found by the search feature. Alternatively, an extra category &quot;groups&quot; could be introduced alongside &quot;recent conversations&quot; and &quot;contacts&quot;. 👍 2

		Hello, One of my friends have some technical problems with Google Play Services, so he can't register his phone number in the Signal app without having an error message from the Google Services. Personnaly, i use signal with a custom rom without GMS, and strangely, i didn't have problems to register (but i didn't tried the voip service with anybody). So it would be cool if you be cool if you develop a version wich would work without GMS for privacy- aware users. Thanks P.s.: To describe briefly my fried's problem, the recovery code that google sends to him never works and is always considered as incorrect, and i don't know why.

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description There are a couple of other issues (#6468, #5992 and WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS#2903) about this problem. One of them has been closed and the other two could've been filed in a more structured way so I'm opening this one hoping we can move this conversation forward in a constructive way. The problem is that Google App Engine blocks connection from Iran and this renders the anti censorship feature of signal useless for Iranian people. This is important now as the authorities are trying to shut down all the secure messaging platforms following the uprising and economical protests. Additionally, Telegram, -the main social media and messaging app for Iranian people-, has been blocked recently and this gives us a golden chance to help people adopt Signal. All it takes is to make sure all the Iranian numbers are being routed through a meek server that is not Google. We at Tor, have tested both Azure and Amazon and they work perfectly fine. I assume this is gonna be the same with other major CDNs as well. Steps to reproduce Try to connect to Signal servers from an Iranian IP address Actual result: Connection fails due to censorship. Expected result: OWS needs to either switch to, or add new meek servers on a platform that isn't Google App Engine and Signal should automatically enable censorship circumvention feature for Iranian phone numbers (+98).

		I have: searched open and closed issues for duplicates read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports Bug description When holding the phone in one hand you will most often end up using that hand's thumb to swipe left and right. Naturally, this results in a gesture slightly diagonal (e.g. from bottom left to top right and vice versa for the right hand) rather than exactly horizontal. The gesture detection fails in this case, since it seems to expect a nearly horizontal move, which is nearly impossible to accomplish in one-hand-usage. Hence, the gesture detection should be more &quot;liberal&quot;, if the move direction isn't absolutely accurate. Besides of that, a full screen mode (that can be toggled) would fit in fairly nice.
