		Use the ViewPager when episodes are displayed inside there own activity (currently only in portrait mode on non-xlarge devices). It worked alright in a prototype but it remains to be seen if this may need improvements on the episode image loading code. A minor bug has already been discovered (the background image does not seem to always load correctly when swiping), so changes to the EpisodeDetailsFragment will likely be necessary.

		Hi Uwe, i have found another issue in your app in the episode-listview. the Actionbar menu and the menu entries in the bottom(hardwarekey)menu will be duplicated if the device gets rotated multiple times. There are also some issues for debate. And therefore i will not open an new official issue: If i click Watched all, also episodes will and can be marked as watched, that are in the future or there airdate are unknown. Calendar Export: you can export episodes to the calendare that are in the past. And in The Show-Overview you can export to calendar if &quot;no next episode found&quot;. To the 2nd &quot;issue&quot; its also fair to say &quot;keep the menu entries consistent to the user&quot; all the time. regards, David Wiesner 2.5.3beta (dbver 24) Android 2.2

		When entering a shows overview screen or any episode detail screen we should check if that show has been updated in the last 24 hours (make that a little less as users won't check exactly every 24+ hours). If not, we'll update it in the background potentially leading to destruction and chaos. Ok, rather super-class the hosting activities than the fragments. If not each EpisodeDetailsFragment would try to start an update, that seems like too much background noise.

		http://square.github.com/otto/ If episodes get marked recalculate remaining episode counters right away, potentially update next episode. Dismissed previously because it isn't worth the effort, as in most cases the calculation has to be done anyhow. However if really every event which would trigger a calculation is covered (which is done more easily with an event bus) there would be a lot of potential for speed ups by not having to run a lot of background threads to update UI state. Show list next episode (goal: update only single shows as needed): After any updates to a single show (TVDb and trakt): episode or just description can change Potentially if marking an episode watched/unwatched anywhere Season watch counters (goal: update only single season counters as needed): If marking an episode watched/unwatched anywhere After any updates to that show (TVDb and trakt sync) How granular should we go? Only tell that a part of a show, a season or even an episode was updated?

		Up until now there are multiple people (I know of) experiencing this problem. The trakt API just returns {&quot;status&quot;:&quot;failure&quot;,&quot;error&quot;:&quot;bad user&quot;}
 despite users being able to login on trakt.tv. The trakt guys don't seem to really know what's going on there, so this can be seen as a notice for future incidents. If you experience problems when interacting with any trakt part of SeriesGuide (connecting an account, syncing, etc.), please log debug output (e.g. with CatLog) while you repeat the failing action multiple times. Look through the logs for any TraktException or the string above. If you confirmed your problem is the above, it would help if you could drop your trakt user name to support@seriesgui.de so we can maybe at some point establish a pattern. If not file a new issue or just drop a mail.

		Just another idea to help indicate which show you're currently checked into, assuming it's possible to get your checked-in state (which I'm guessing it is since I've seen the timer saying you have so and so much time left before you can check in again). Basically, the check in button is it's original gray color, and once you're checked into a show, it becomes the newer purple color, and the label changes from &quot;Check In&quot; to &quot;Checked In&quot;.

		Hi, I read the feature requests that deal with recommendations, and it seems, recommendations will not be implemented in SeriesGuide to avoid bloating. Still though, I came to rely on SeriesGuide when it comes to what is on currently/recently/coming up and I visit trakt.tv rarely (read, never), so I could be missing something. My suggestion for manageable recommendation list would be to show whatever the list initially is on trakt.tv, for each item have an add/ignore choices, so that user can clean up the list manually. If the user is not interested in cleaning up the list, then also 'have a 30-days old recommendations are cleared automatically' policy to clean up the list on the device to avoid bloating. There could be an optional notification, when new recommendations arrive in the list. Does it sound reasonable enough?

		In the &quot;Unseen/Upcoming&quot; view, if the last aired episode has been marked watched, the show disapears from this view. For me this is a little missleading, I thought this filter or view would display all shows, which have unseen episodes. But I can also understand the purpose, for example if someone step into a show later and don't want to watch all past episodes. Maybe its posible to add a per show setting to control this or a complete different view.

To solve this problem, you can set the field mFragment, on every time the ShowsFragment is attached to the FragmentActivity by override onAttachFragment in ShowsActivity @Override
public void onAttachFragment (Fragment fragment) {
    if(fragment instanceof ShowsFragment){
        mFragment=fragment;

		Currently widgets are updated roughly every 5 minutes when the device is awake (REPETITION_INTERVAL = 5 * DateUtils.MINUTE_IN_MILLIS). Granted, at least the update is not performed when the device is asleep, but I find the 5 minutes interval unreasonable short considering that series times usually don't change at all during the day. Hence it would be nice if the widget update interval was customizable, or at least if the current 5 minutes interval could be reduced to a longer interval.

		This one is pretty weird, never seen it before. I think it has to do with the SGH lib, but I'm not sure in what way right now. I only think so because it doesn't show up when you have infinite scrolling turned on and therefore no SGH. You can't actually grab it, but if you grab the right side, while the left one is still visible, both will drag. To reproduce: Go the Activity (make sure infinite scrolling is turned off) Quickly scroll down, when you hit the bottom you'll see it occur Screenshot

		While I appreciate the switch in v9 beta, which moved the update progress bar below action bar, now it looks awkward (at least with the Android Dark theme), because the divider is there all the time and when update is in progress, it just adds right below it, making the line two times that thick, (moreover, the divider stays intact and the progress bar animates, which looks weird, given they both have the same color in the mentioned theme). It would look much cleaner if the divider was replaced by the progress bar during update - the line would stay the same thick and the animation would look much better.

		There is no way to remove movie from watchlist or add it from movie details activity. Right now this option exists only in lists. This is not very convenient if user decides to do one of these actions after viewing details about a movie. He'll have to go back to list, find item, open context menu, and click on a button. It would be nice to have them in details activity.

		Hi, The widget is able to display &quot;upcoming&quot; episodes that are in the future, and &quot;recent&quot; episodes. But, back when there was a Seriesguide and separate Seriesguide X, I think it was possible to display only unwatched episodes that have already been aired. Hopefully this feature can be revived. I think it would be very convenient if there is another category &quot;Unwatched&quot; for the widget that simply shows unwatched but aired episodes. If all aired episodes have already been watched then the widget can just be empty for as far as I'm concerned. Right now, in my opinion the widget is too cluttered because of the future and recently aired episodes. I'd like to be able and see my own progress in one simple view. Or is that possible and is this something I am consistently overlooking? Regardless, the app itself is great and it's been a lot of fun to see the progress in development. So, kudos for that. 👍

		The nav drawer toggle indicator's default gray color doesn't look too good on the new purple action bar. I can't say for sure, but I think the various Google Play apps use a white color tinted with the respective app's action bar color (e.g., white with a hint of orange for Play Music or red for Play Movies). Or maybe it's just a transparent white.

		Hello, First of all, I'm using French UI so some messages might not be translated exactly as it is in English UI. Plus, when I say check I mean marked as seen, I don't use the check-in feature. I noticed today after going on a TV show details, that it updated seasons and episodes as it always does, but this time lots of episodes were removed from “seen” in front of my eyes, even random episodes from other seasons that I watched months, maybe years ago. It happened to lot of TV shows but I will just take one as example: Case Closed. Some episodes from season 7, half from season 22, and the whole season 23 were marked unseen. So I looked on trakt and indeed they weren't marked seen. So I checked all seen from season 7 and 22, and checked first episodes from season 23 that I did watch. I got message “7x seen. Sending to trakt” as I always get. No error from catlog. I got back on trakt, season 7 was OK, season 22 and 23 were still missing. You can see in my history that I indeed just checked episodes from season 7: http://trakt.tv/users/yurienu/history and that season 22 and 23 are missing: http://trakt.tv/users/yurienu/progress I tried again a lot of times to mark season 22 seen but I kept getting the Sending to trakt message with no error. Is it possible that it has something to do with international titles? Thank you for your help,

		Hi I am new to this app so it might be that I just misunderstand the filter, but as far as I understand it it should only show shows with unwatched episodes. However, when I apply it all shows (including those with unwatched episodes and those with all episodes unwatched) are hidden. I suppose that's not how its intended. Since I see nobody else reporting this, maybe it was introduced in today's update.

		SeriesGuide doesn't have an option to add shows to the watchlist, and my shows list is too big already to add all these shows I come across but can't watch now. Can you add support for it? Maybe to the left of the +/check in the Add Show menu? (but with a small margin to prevent muscle memory errors)

		Since trakt's recent site wide update, the only way to access their movie/show recommendation engine is view the api. Since SeriesGuide is already OAuthed for a user, this provides a unique opportunity for SeriesGuide to be the first/easiest way for someone to take advantage of this feature. Provide a section or feature called 'suggest a movie/show' in which the trakt recommendation engine is polled by SeriesGuide http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/#reference/recommendations/get-watched-history

		Hi. Developer question: I see from the changelog that it used to be possible to directly search TheTVDB - but this was disabled. I'm curious about ideas and thoughts on using SeriesGuide without trakt.tv login. There is another open source Apache 2.0 app out there for Android that has direct integration with TheTVDB - https://github.com/tarzasai/Uoccin Is there any reason to be against having a mode that is pure TheTVDB?

		Here's an example with the show Wonderfalls, but this works with any show that aired in the 'wrong' order. Set 1x05 Crime Dog (DVD 5.0, aired 23/07) and all older episodes as watched Next Episode is now 1x07 Muffin Buffalo (DVD 6.0, aired 23/07). It jumped 1x06 Barrel Bear (DVD 7.0, aired 27/10) After setting 1x07 as watched, Next Episode is now 1x11 Cocktail Bunny (DVD 11.0, aired 25/07) Is there a way to make Next Episode follow the sorting order selected in the episode list(if we're watching the show on Netflix, DVD or any other source that isn't TV)? Sometimes setting a special episode as watched makes SeriesGuide jump whole seasons, because it aired in the middle of the show.

			<summary>Trakt syncing (with large history?) is slow, disruptive, can cause data loss</summary>

		I really like the idea of trakt syncing in SeriesGuide. While SeriesGuide is my preferred tool for organizing my viewing, mirroring that history to an online, shared database with social features has a certain appeal. However, the reality of the current trakt syncing feature — as it exists in SG v.30.0.1(Database v38) — falls somewhat short of that ideal, and is making me consider disabling the trakt syncing just to restore some usability to SeriesGuide. Here's my typical SeriesGuide experience, with AutoUpdate enabled and SeriesGuide connected to trakt (only, not Cloud): Launch the SeriesGuide app, which usually takes me to Recent as that's the tab I was last viewing. The spinner at the top of the tab begins twirling as SeriesGuide starts syncing with trakt. Various shows begin transiently appearing in the list, as SeriesGuide &quot;resets&quot; their watched status before applying the state downloaded from trakt. (This is bug #487) If I attempt to mark any episodes (of any show) as Watched during the syncing process, those watched flags will more often than not be lost by SeriesGuide when it finishes syncing. (This may relate to bug #458 — @pironic writes &quot;Occasionally I find that under some conditions outside of the SeriesGuide pervue, shows and movies are scrobbled twice.&quot;, but I find that most of my duplicate activity is caused by SeriesGuide, when it loses Watched flags and I re-apply them, only to later find out that I've created duplicates.) Several minutes after syncing starts (this is no exaggeration — the syncing spinner can last anywhere from 45 seconds to 2, 3+ minutes), the update completes and I am able to make changes in SeriesGuide without them being lost. I realize that what SeriesGuide can do in syncing with trakt is constrained by the trakt API, and that ideal efficiency may not be possible given those constraints. But I feel like something at least needs to be done to make the syncing (a) more asynchronous and (b) less disruptive, so that SeriesGuide can be used while it's going on. The situation in bug #487 — where SeriesGuide manipulates the live datastore during the syncing process, removing and reapplying the entire Watched history for a show instead of simply making updates ­— feels like a prime candidate for refactoring and improvement. As some data points on my situation, SeriesGuide is running on a Samsung Galaxy S4, not exactly a slow or resource-starved device. (And I'm running SlimKat 9.0, a CyanoGen-based Android 4.4.4 — not Samsung's dog-slow stock OS.) It connects to the internet over Sprint's 4G LTE network in New York City, which typically gives me SpeedTest numbers of 6 - 12 Mbps down, 4 - 6 Mbps up. In every sense, performance is as good as can reasonably be expected. To give you an idea of my datastore, this is what SeriesGuide is working with: So, I'm far from a light user. It's entirely possible that I simply have too much data in SeriesGuide, and syncing it all to trakt is just too intensive a process. However, most of those shows are fully watched and Hidden, simply there for historical reasons. There's no reason to expect that they'd be receiving updates. If necessary I can delete the historical data from SeriesGuide, though it would be preferable if that info could simply be excluded from the syncing process in some way, rather than having to be discarded. It's also possible that having active shows on my list like Saturday Night Live (41 seasons / 810 episodes and counting) and The Simpsons (27 seasons / 602 episodes and counting) makes the syncing process unduly heavy. But, short of canceling those shows, I'm not sure what I can really do about that, so if that is indeed a problem then it would appear to be another way in which the syncing process is ripe for improvement. (I haven't even considered adding really high-volume shows like The Daily Show to SeriesGuide, even though I do watch it regularly.) SeriesGuide is a really great tool, and the trakt integration, while intriguing, would be a wonderful feature if only it didn't interfere so greatly with the app's performance and utility.

		Occasionally while scrolling the Recent list, I accidentally tap a checkmark next to one of the entries, marking something as Watched that I didn't intend. Since the entry immediately disappears, usually before I can notice what it was, I'm left with only the &quot;XxYY Seen. Sent to trakt&quot; message at the bottom of the screen as a hint as to what I just accidentally removed from the list, so that I can hunt it down and un-mark it. Sometimes that's easy, as there are other episodes of the same show nearby and the &quot;hole&quot; is obvious. Sometimes it's far from obvious, and requires substantial digging. It'd be handy if the &quot;checked-in&quot; message stuck around slightly longer than it does currently, and either provided an &quot;Undo&quot; function directly, or (failing that) was tappable to navigate to the episode in question, so that it could be unmarked. (Currently, attempting to tap on the message just selects whatever list entry is below it.) This is in line with, e.g. GMail's list features, where immediately after an action is taken, the success message includes an Undo link in case the action was made in error. 👍 1

		Regarding the new popup menu displayed after pressing the tick icon; please consider removing it, adding an option to disable it, or making the popup menu only show up after long pressing the tick icon. The default action for the tick icon since it's creation has been setting an episode as watched and the addition of this popup menu does nothing more but add an extra step to the process of doing this. Myself and from what I can tell many other users do not use the &quot;check in&quot; or even the entire collections features meaning that it really does absolutely nothing but add an extra step to what used to be a 1 button process. I'd also like to point out that &quot;set watched&quot; isn't even the first item on the popup menu making it really easy to accidentally press the wrong menu item since it's between two others. I personally don't update all the episodes I've seen right after I've seen them meaning that when I do enter the app I'm planning on setting quite a lot of episodes as watched and this popup menu quite frankly makes it a really annoying pain in the butt. It doesn't help that the popup menu actually covers up the next episode that I want to set as watched so I have to search for the icon again and try not to be too fast or else oops I just added it to my collection. I'll also point out that when I opened the app today to set episodes as watched I managed to accidentally add an episode to my unused collection because I pressed the tick icon expecting it to do what it's always done but instead causing the popup menu to show up over the next tick icon I wanted to press causing &quot;add to collection&quot; to be selected instead. I can go on and on about how much I absolutely despise this feature and want it to burn if you need more motivation to kill it. Though trying to be a bit more level headed, I think it would just be a better idea if you made the popup menu show up on long press of the tick icon instead of changing the default action that icon has had since I believe forever.
