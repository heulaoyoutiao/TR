		I noticed that whenever my Android time wasn't automatically synced with the network then: a) No cards appeared ready for reviews in my deck. b) Syncing with server failed. All was fixed by setting the Android time in sync again. No sure if this is known already but I thought I'd flag it in case someone else has this problem.

		So, the events for me of today: mild annoyance over some problems in the current stable ankidroid realize there hasn't been a stable ankidroid release since 2.0.1 in february check for the source and find out development has been ongoing try beta feature of play store, url doesn't work after login, throws 404 try to look at the source to see if i can compile it myself and to read up on the changes done in development search and finally find the tag of 2.0.1 to find out that development branches off on an earlier point and then devolves into absolute merge hell, making it impossible to actually read the change log in a sane manner spend two hours to rebuild history with cherry-picking and releasing I ended up with a history as you can see in: https://github.com/wchristian/Anki-Android Screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nic6el1lzzvfhze/ankidroid.png Not a single commit was changed in the rebase/cherry-pick process, they smoothly fit onto one another in a linear fashion. Aside from a single commit where the git algorithm made a mistake i didn't even have any conflicts. I cleaned the entire history going back to the point where current dev and 2.0.1 diverged, all in the space of two hours. The cost of implemeting this in actual ongoing development would be minimal, as it would be only a case of rebasing/cherry-picking the branches github reports as clean for merge. Additionally i'd happily volunteer to do the busywork and offer aid in helping others over any issues they might have with this. What do you say?

		There is a personal Anki sync server available from here: https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server Users of the Anki desktop app can sync against it instead of AnkiWeb by creating a special add-on. However, AnkiDroid has the URL for AnkiWeb hardcoded! It'd be great to allow users to configure the URL of the sync server that they wish to use. There's already an issue for this on Google Code, but it was been marked as &quot;WontFix&quot;: http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=154 I'd like to re-open this discussion is possible. :-) I've been running a personal sync server based on this code on Bibliobird.com for almost 3 years (will be in December) and I've deployed it for client projects as well. The code's not perfect but it definitely works enough to be useful for many people! I'd be happy to help with code too, so long as I can get a little direction on where the maintainers think this should be in the application and if they'd even consider merging this feature. Thanks!

			<summary>Burying a learning card makes it appear as a new card</summary>
			<url>https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/168</url>
			<bugID>Issue #168</bugID>
			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		What steps will reproduce the problem? When a new card appears, click 10 minutes. The next time it appears, bury it. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? When it is time for another new card, the buried card reappears with the left-most column underlined, i.e. it is again shown as a 'new' card. At this point, one can sync with Ankiweb and then open in desktop the Information (Ctrl-Shift-I) for the card, where the history of clicking '10 minutes' is shown. Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one time? Yes, the bug is completely reproducible. What version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list &gt; menu &gt; About &gt; Look at the title)? 2.0.2 beta 6 On what version of Android? (Home screen &gt; menu &gt; About phone &gt; Android version) 2.1 To get another 'new' card to appear, I used &quot;Custom Study -&gt; Increase today's new card limit&quot;. I'm not sure if the bug is reproducible with 'natural' new cards.

		The pluralized string stats_today_cards_not_bold in values_NN/06-statistics.xml is highly visible. That is the “Studied x card(s) in y minute(s)” at the bottom of the deck picker. I think it should be moved to 01-core.xml. I could just move that, as i am working on code related to that string, but am wary to do that. When a string is moved from one file to the other, does it keep its translation at crowdin? Similarly, i think the naming should be the other way around. The stats_today_cards_not_bold should be something like cards_studied_today and stats_today_cards something like cards_studied_today_bold. I guess that one should stay in 06-satistics, as it is used only in the stats activity. I guess renaming these strings, if done, should wait until i am through with my time formatting changes (soon) to avoid merge conflicts.

		I have Ankidroid notifications turned on so there's constantly a little Anki star-shaped reminder on my notification bar. I also have an Android watch, which displays the first line of every notification. Ankidroid's current setup is like this: First line: Cards due Second line: 185 Ankidroid cards due I propose that it be changed so that the first line says 185 Cards Due so as to be more readable on smartwatches and less redundant on all devices.

		I was having trouble getting my CSS styling that worked on Windows and Mac Anki to work in AnkiDroid.

		I was doing reviews on my tablet, finished a few decks, decided to sync and left the tablet for a while. Then I came back and I saw the error reporting dialog. So it must have crashed because of an exception. It was the third of fourth sync today. I let Android update a few apps in the background and the update might have been still running while I was syncing. I don't know if it has any relation to the crash. Sorry for an overly generic title of this bug report but AnkiDroid did not show any details of the exception and I don't know what to say about it apart from the fact that it happened. I can't even search for similar issues. I have sent the report from the app so you can look at it and see what the error was. AnkiDroid Version = 2.4.3
Android Version = 5.1.1
ACRA UUID = 815a9261-620e-4280-a814-f075aae6be54

		Since when I select full screen mode for reviewing, only the top status bar is hidden but the bottom buttons remain. This produces an issue for me. Since these buttons are right under the Ankidroid buttons it's easy to tap on the wrong button when I'm focusing or getting slightly quicker on learning. So I wonder if the real completely full screen available yet?

		My daughter is a quite regular user of Ankidroid - thank you for this great software! However, during the summer holidays she nevertheless has built up quite a backlog of old cards to repeat. During the school year, she should concentrate on learning and repeating the newly added cards, while not totally ignoring the older cards. How can I configure this? My idea: In the &quot;repetitions&quot; section of the stack options, I'd like to see some way to shift the weight towards recently learned cards.

		On 2.5alpha61. Steps to reproduce: Have a deck (Parent) that contains no cards, but does contain subdecks (Child1, Child2, etc) that DO contain cards. Try to tap Parent. Receive error message at the bottom of the screen that the deck is empty. My workaround is to add a note to that parent deck to get AnkiDroid to recognize that it's not empty. Having done so, if I tap Parent, it displays the cards from Child1 and Child2 as I'd expect.

		In the second screenshot, you can see that the window height is no greater than the window height in the first. Instead, there's a blank black bar above the deck title that simply takes up space. Full screen mode is supposed to hide the status bar and reclaim that space for the study window, right? That was the behavior I was used to seeing until I updated to the latest alpha (though I sadly couldn't tell you the version number under which this was most recently working).

		In the screenshot below, there's some wasted space to the right of both images. This is despite my having changed the image zoom setting to a high value. If the images were to be stretched to occupy the full width of the screen, images that contain text would be more readable, and I wouldn't need to rely on pinch to zoom. I know CSS is outside the scope of this project, but I'll ask in case anyone has advice: Is there a CSS value I should add to the note to force the image to scale to the full width of the screen? I don't want it to just be stretched disproportionately - I want it to scale the height and width properly.

		On 2.5alpha64: Steps to reproduce: Have a filtered deck with some cards in it. Open the filtered deck. Empty the filtered deck (either by hitting Empty or by completing all the cards, which sends them back to their home deck). Go back to the deck list. Try to tap on the filtered deck to open it (which is the only way you can access the Rebuild button that repopulates the deck with the cards) Get error bar at the bottom of the screen saying this deck is empty. This error message prevents you from opening the deck and getting to the Rebuild button. Workaround: Manually create a new filtered deck using the same parameters... which is tedious to do, since it requires naming it, entering all the search terms, adjusting the card limits and other settings, etc.

		I’ve been using Anki via the desktop version and my phone for many months (probably years) without any issues. However, I recently downloaded a shared deck that included a lot of mp3 music clips. On my laptop it was no problem, but when I synced to my phone, the sync failed because it ran out of room on my phone. I am not very experienced at dealing with the Android OS (this is my first issue with storage). To try to solve the problem, I: Completely removed the new deck from my Anki collection via my laptop. I’ve been in and out of my collection via the desktop version numerous times since then, including activities like changing a card type which resulted in a full sync with Ankiweb. I then tried to sync again on my phone but it still gave me error msgs related to storage I uninstalled Anki from my phone and reinstalled – still errors I uninstalled Anki again, and also deleted a folder that I found under System Settings --&gt; Storage --&gt; Misc --&gt; AnkiDroid (333 MB) – still errors I tried again just now to uninstall, delete folder, reinstall and again I got an error msg. I'm sorry I don't have better info on the error msgs, but they seem to vary, and just now when I tried it again, it gave me no info except that it is going to send a report to the developers (which it often says), no other info about what the error itself was, though in the past they usually mention storage. I never got them before this mess with the huge shared deck I downloaded, and since I deleted the shared deck, I’d think the size of my collection would be back to the size it was before when I didn’t get errors. By the way, after the error msg, Anki sometimes appears open and acts like I can review, but within a few cards it gives me an error and will not let me review anymore or sync what I’ve done so far. Other times Anki won't open, or immediately gives me an error (no info) and may or may not open. Any ideas?

		I live in Germany, and we have just had a DST time change the night before - at 3:00 25.10.2015 the clock was reset to 2:00 again. I have my 'Start of next day' set to 0:00 and it normally works. Except for today... Currently, my time is 23:28 in the current time zone (GMT+01:00 Central European Standard Time), but with DST applied it would be 0:28 (GMT+02:00 Central European Summer Time). Apparently, Anki got confused about the hour and thinks it is after midnight. I started using Anki while we had DST applied, so I guess all its timestamps are saved relative to that or something, and it doesn't store the TZ anywhere. Or whatever, I have no idea about the internals. I guess a similar issue would manifest itself if I created my collection now, and waited until the first night after DST applies again - the 'next day' would start one hour after my setting. Will it 'fix itself' on somehow, like when the times are saved again, this time with the new TZ? The desktop version has the same issue, so I guess this is not an Anki Droid thing, but who knows. Are you aware of the issue? Should I just file an issue upstream?

		I'm not sure exactly where this is coming from, though i suspect the fact that i have my &quot;start of next day&quot; configured to +5 hours. What will happen first is that near the end of a learning session it'll show my todo status on the deck as something like (10 30 0), but when i go to review, despite my having selected &quot;new cards after review&quot;, it will give me all the new cards first. Then, when i get through the new cards, and the display is (0 30 0) and i start review, it'll give me one of the &quot;learn&quot; cards, and if i select 1 hour, show it to me again, immediately, and then end the review session, with a state of (0 29 0). I tried digging around in the code a bit, but it was a little too cryptic for me to make any headway into that.

		I sometimes downgrade AnkiDroid to compare the new version with the old one. To do so, I have to uninstall AnkiDroid in advance. Moreover, after downgrade it or upgrading to the latest version again, I have to log in to the AnkiWeb again, and have to reset 'Gesture' preference again. I find it troublesome. Is it possible to allow the system to downgrade AnkiDroid without uninstall it?

		Setting one deck to random order appears to set all decks to random order, and vice-versa. Just go into one deck and change the order, then go and look at another deck - its order has changed too. Unfortunately, by this point it has already done irreversible damage - even if you (for example) switch a deck accidentally changed to random back to deck order, some of the random cards have already been queued up and will appear in your study schedule. This is very frustrating if the new cards are highly dependent on knowledge of previous cards in the deck. Meanwhile, I have other decks where the deck order is arbitrary and studying in deck order would be boring. What I need now is not only a fix for this bug, but also a way to return cards that have already appeared in my study schedule permanently to their correct order in the deck. Suspending the cards is not a desirable solution - the deck is very large and it would require me to work out exactly when to unsuspended the cards in question.

		Hi, I have been using v.2.4.3 from F-Droid. Last night, however, I installed 2.5 beta 12 to see how it was all coming along. I attempted to do some studying, but immediately ran into an issue. The beta is showing me spelling corrections. This wholly conflicts with my &quot;Misspelling&quot; note type, where a TTS mp3 speaks a commonly misspelled word, to which I must type an answer and have that checked on the back. Obviously since I'm being shown the answer while typing the answer this defeats the purpose. Please revert AnkiDroid back to 2.4.3 behavior of not displaying spelling corrections while typing an answer while studying. I'm sure many others use Anki this way as well. Thank you. Attached:

		@hssm The immersive API is not designed to be used together with an action bar, and touching it (the action bar) leads to the status bar appearing on top of it. This is only slightly annoying when tapping a button, but when it's the overflow menu the status bar ends up getting in the way and it feels really buggy. How about removing the immersive mode flag in v2.5 (i.e. revert to v2.4 behavior) until we can come up with a better way to workaround the limitations of the API? Alternatively, I can think of a few workarounds if you're motivated to spin something out for 2.5...?

		I use a Bluetooth keyboard to send commands/shortcuts to AnkiDroid when reviewing my cards. In version 2.5beta17, the keyboard shortcuts don't seem to be working. It's almost as if the window is losing focus. Here's what happens: A question appears. I try to press Space on the keyboard to activate &quot;show answer.&quot; Nothing happens. I press Tab on the keyboard, and the &quot;show answer&quot; button changes to a lighter color to indicate it's selected. I press Space again and it does activate &quot;show answer.&quot; The above behavior is the same in both immersive/full screeb mode and normal mode. However, in normal mode, I can then press 1, 2, 3, or 4 on my keyboard to choose Again, Hard, Good, Easy. I can also hit Space to activate the default answer (Good). On the next card, Show Answer is already highlighted, so I don't need to press Tab to bring it into focus again. In immersive mode, nothing happens if I press 1, 2, 3, 4 or space. The keyboard is still sending the keystroke, but I think the keystroke is being sent to the wrong layer or something. Hope this makes sense! Let me know if there's other information you need. I took a break from Anki for a few weeks, so I unfortunately don't know which version broke this behavior.

		The new immersive mode/true full screen hides the bar that displays whether the card is new, learning, or due, and hides the remaining number of cards in each of those categories. It also hides the timer. AnkiMobile for iOS deals with this by putting the new/learning/due counts in the Show Answer part of the screen. If AnkiDroid could display the information there, along with the timer, it would improve Immersive Mode. Otherwise, would it be possible to have two options for full screen? One that preserves the old full screen behavior, by displaying only the upper menu bar, and one that has the new Immersive behavior? Since I really want to see my timer and card counts, I'm turning off the fullscreen setting, which is a step backwards for me.

			<description>
		The &quot;Automatic display answer&quot; feature (which should probably be renamed &quot;Automatically display answer&quot;) sounds great in theory, but I don't like that it automatically selects Again if I don't answer in time. It would be better if users could select the action that AnkiDroid takes if the time runs out before he/she rates the card. Personally, I would love to set it to Bury the card, so that I don't upset the SRS algorithm by being inattentive at the wrong moment. The current &quot;Again&quot; behavior can lead to a case like this: I'm chugging along, answering cards, when suddenly I'm distracted by someone walking into the room. A Mature card comes up on my phone, the time runs out, and it gets rated Again and sent back to relearn, breaking the SRS algorithm. This could happen several times in a row before I realize and put a stop to it. While it's true that in this case I could hit Undo over and over until I get back to my last truly answered card, it could be difficult to remember where I last left off. Also, if Anki goes idle for some time, or I clumsily navigate to the deck screen to stop the onslaught of cards, or I relaunch Anki from the notification bar, I think I'd lose the Undo capability. On the other hand, if I had it set to Bury the card if it went unanswered for X seconds, I could always unbury that card later. Worst case scenario, I see the card the next day. This is much less disruptive to the SRS algorithm, while still having all the benefits of keeping me focused.

		On 2.5beta24, when you have Night Mode enabled and you rate a card Hard, the two indicator dots that pop up above the card are impossible to see against the gray background of that bar. If I watch reeeally closely, I can just barely make them out. Having them be so faintly contrasted against this bar makes me wonder &quot;Did I perform the gesture right and trigger the Hard rating? Or did I perform the wrong gesture, triggering Good or Again, and just miss seeing the indicator dots?&quot; A cleaner solution would be to change the color of those dots to black, or change the gray background of that bar to black. Since the default card background in Night Mode is black anyway, changing the background to black would get my vote here.

		Is there a keyboard shortcut for Undo? If so, what is it? If not, can it be mapped to z or u or some other single-character shortcut? In Windows at least, the typical shortcut is Ctrl+z, but I'm using a gamepad that doesn't support multiple simultaneous keypresses so Ctrl+anything is impossible. Even on a normal keyboard it's more sensible to require as few modifier keys as possible, for speed's sake.

		Since the last update of Ankidroid, I can't open any collections I've had previously. I can't even do anything besides stare at the screen since the error interface takes up the whole screen. I tried the several options that it suggests like checking the database, restoring from backup, full sync from server, and delete collection and create new one. The only thing that kind of &quot;works&quot; is the last option, which is to delete the current collection (which I actually don't have) and to start a new one. With this option the error interface goes away and I can get shared decks. The problem arises again when I try to sync. This is a problem for me since some of the decks I have in my collection are no longer available via shared decks and I'd like to be able to have them on my phone. Anyway, the gist of it is that I can't access my personal collection.

		The new version of the app looks great to me, but typing in the answer now produces a different behavior which I think is objectively wrong (in contrast to issue #3912, which seems to be full of subjective issues). With the old app, my keyboard app new not to upper-case the first letter of input. With the new version, my keyboard thinks it should be upper-case, which means I must use several extra keystrokes (exact number is keyboard dependent), or enter an answer which AnkiDroid thinks is &quot;wrong&quot;, because the first character of my answer is upper case, while it was expecting lower case. I'm not entirely sure what mechanism controls this behavior, but I suspect there's a simple input hint/class that ought to be set that no longer is.

		Hello Ankidroid team, thanks a lot for the amazing new interface, a real pleasure to use. One thing I really like (although I had never realised I needed it) is getting rid of the study screen. It's only unfortunate that 2.5.2 re-introduces it. I don't really mind either way, but the current solution of having it &quot;if you type on the numbers&quot; is problematic: Using the phone one-handed means that the thumb naturally hits on the right side (for right handed people), making &quot;study-screen / not&quot; a pretty random behaviour (you're always very close to the in/out boundary). That, and the fact that the numbers have different length depending on the amount of cards.. Could we please have a setting to either enable/disable the study screen? The current functionality is less convenient than either 2.4 or 2.5.

		You don't understand. I ask for another feature. Look, i've created topic but you closed it very fast #3952 Sorry if i violated any rules, but read my comment. Just imagine i've got deck with 10k cards. I forgot 100 and want to learn. I make custom deck from forgotten cards. I study. After that i want to study reversed cards from that 100. I offered to click on that deck and after Create Custom -&gt; Reversed. I will get reversed cards of my deck. It's simple. Now you offered me very strange and hard method.

		I have observed this behavior both in AnkiDroid 2.4 and 2.5. I have a French vocabulary card for the word 'terre', and two definitions and two images. The images are named 'terre.jpg' and 'Terre.jpg', respectively, as the second definition refers to the proper name of the planet on which we live. But AnkiDroid doesn't recognize that 'terre.jpg' and 'Terre.jpg' are distinct images, and shows the same image twice (which image it shows seems to be indeterminate, as I've at times seen 'terre.jpg' and at times 'Terre.jpg').

		This is most likely an Anki bug, but I couldn't find a place to file the bug in the repo so I'll leave it here for now. So I'm using the Human Japanese deck(it's on the shared deck page). It has tags for every chapter so I've always been pulling cards away in separate chapter decks, studying them with rescheduling and then letting them go back to the main deck and continuing there. It all worked good until yesterday when I thought I was done(finished all cards in the latest chapter + some more that were still unseen because I buried them earlier) and I'd have only reviews to do, only to wake up and see about 500 total new unseen cards, some of them in my main deck, and some of them in the custom decks(which I didn't delete, because I was lazy). Having them pop up in the custom made decks seems really weird since from what I understand they should be completely moved back to the main deck once they go in review mode and the deck should be 'empty'. I also seem to be getting some funky reviews(there's a bit more than I expected) and some of them have odd dates. I tried running a check database and a check media and they were good. Anybody has ideas?

		When I tried to sync with my Ankiweb account today, AnkiDroid indicated I was not logged in. I've been successfully syncing without issue for about two years now, and this is the first time it has happened. Nothing has changed as far as my email-address or password in all that time. After reentering my credentials, I am given the error message &quot;Invalid email address or password&quot; after about 1 second. I verified their correctness through repeated typed-in attempts and by copying and pasting from a text editor to ensure both were exactly correct. I ensured that the android keyboard was not appending a space. I'm definitely using my email address and not my username (although I tried the latter anyways) I tested my credentials both directly on Ankiweb and the Windows Anki application, and it worked fine in both locations. As for the email address itself, the only thing possibly unusual about it is it has an underscore in the name (e.g. foo_bar@foobar.com). The password is purely alphanumeric and is 11 characters in length. As I mentioned, these have worked in AnkiDroid without issue for a long time.

		New feature that makes a single card, with all the note's clozes to be reviewed that day, from one cloze type note instead of as many cards as the number of clozes in the note. Reviews are done with auto scrolling down the single card. Note's clozes to be reviewed that day, while are being answered successively from top to bottom of the card, simultaneously, the screen view keeps moving down the card. This is useful for learning a whole lengthy essay by eliminating the problem of &quot;dissociation from context&quot; that occurs from apparent randomness arising in reviews of the many cards made out of one cloze type note. One gets to go through and learn the whole essay &quot;in the order&quot; it exists and needs to be learnt.

		It would be great if you could have the tags for each card showing in a list down the bottom of each card. A good use case for this is if you have a Deck called 'Programming Languages' your question could be the same: how do you declare a variable? But your answer will be different depending on what the language is. I tag the cards with a language tag on Anki (OSX version) but I am unable to see the tag on AnkiDroid without editing the card. It would be great if down the bottom of each card you could show the list of tags. This might be good to have as a per Deck setting. Thanks

		Hi, I just got a new phone (Doogee X5 running android 5.1) and downloaded AnkiDroid 2.5.4 onto it from the Play store. When I first opened the app, it let me log on and seemed to be synching, but when I went back later it crashed on opening and has crashed on opening ever since. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times, even deleting all anki related data from my phone. This has not worked. On opening the app, a small grey box appears saying &quot;AnkiDroid has encountered a problem; a report is being sent to the developers...&quot; Then the main app opens with a big white error box saying &quot;collection not opened&quot;. I have tried all the options given: 'Retry opening' just brings up the same error message, 'restore from backup' doesn't do anything as there is no backup on the phone to restore from, 'Full sync from server' brings up the same little grey box and crashes out of the app altogether, 'delete collection and create new one' just seems to make the app hang with the little spinning circle timer thing going round and round. Anki on my desktop still works fine and I have been able to sync it with no problems, so it must be a problem with AnkiDroid and not my decks. Here is what the debug info says: AnkiDroid Version = 2.5.4 Android Version = 5.1 ACRA UUID = 72f41c2f-55b8-4a29-a067-7c1a755979bd Please let me know if there's a way to fix this Edit - Have just tried an APK install of version 2.5beta16 Has the same problems, although I did notice something flash up briefly about not being able to connect to the database, I can't seem to get that message up again though ACRA UUID = 93cfda89-bbc9-4948-b2c0-20c25ec1ce6f Maybe someone who knows how to use this site could see if this one was investigated before for the beta version, I couldn't find a way to search for these UUIDs

Sync with Anki Desktop is quite broken, and I almost always need to force changes in one direction. I've had these strange issues for a while (about half a year when I first got Anki, so it's not related to the new UI). I almost exclusively use Ankidroid, only using Sync and desktop Anki for major changes to my decks. This wasn't too annoying until today, the last day of the year, where I apparently have no cards due today even though I should. My guess is that some parts of the program think the date is off by 1, making today the 366th day of a non-leap year, which has no cards due since it doesn't exist. Timezone is GMT +2, clock on both Ankidroid and Anki Desktop is correct. AnkiDroid Version = 2.5.4 Android Version = 4.4.2 ACRA UUID = cd2acd01-f827-42e5-bf79-76ea79117e3e

		Go to preferences&gt;&gt;Advanced&gt;&gt; Reset languages: &quot;Reset language assignments (for text to speech and dictionaries) for all decks. Reset specific deck assignments on deck picker&quot; I cannot find anywhere a button for resetting a specific deck! Overall I think TTS could be better managed than it is now. It seems like AnkiDroid will ask what TTS voice I want each time a different cardside, deck and notetype comes up. Often this language selection screen comes up just when you have forgotten about it and you accidentally press French. Either you live with it or you reset ALL the tts settings and pray that you will not press French again when a new deck, front-card, back-card, reversed-note type, other note type comes up. EDIT: My suggestion would be to add another entry in the reviewer settings menu (Hide/ Delete, Enable whiteboard, Deck option, SELECT TTS) that would ofc only be visible if TTS was on. This would let you choose both front and back settings for the current card's notetype and deck combination. If you think this is a good idea I would happily implement this myself, but I would need some guidance since I am new to big projects.

		Hi, I'm using AnkiDroid (which is fantastic btw) to learn from several different unrelated decks. But right now I have to consciously decide which deck to learn from and switch between them. I would be really nice if there was a mode where you could say &quot;I'd like to learn across all of these 3 decks&quot; and it would sample between them. I don't think you can just merge the decks since they might have different settings in each deck (e.g. are the cards double side etc). Maybe this feature already exists and I just missed it?

		Sometimes my web connection is slow and instabile. And also (seldon) the Anki Webserver is down. A option to sync the Anki Database with a file would be nice. I also read on the google forum that a few people want to sync their Collection without saving it on the Anki server. They want to use a local Server, or just any cloud. An other Open Source Programm makes it this way: http://keepass.info/ https://keepass2android.codeplex.com/ I don't know if its easy to realize and if you want to include such future. But for me as a non developer I don't see any difficulties since all Entries have Date / Time Stamps. I guess on the exported collections now only the Information for deleted files is missing for a bidirectional syncing feature. I think that it would be a big improvement for the Anki System.

		Hello, So I've been thinking about creating some apps/scripts that would use information from Anki(e.g. I'd want to make a wallpaper to display the new kanji's that I'm learning every day). I've seen there's an API for putting cards into Anki, but I didn't seem to be able to find anything to get information from Anki. Does something like this exist? If not, would it be hard to build? Cheers, Bogdan

Actual behavior: the 'marked' star doesn't change. However, when moved to another card and going back, the star does show the correct 'marked' status. There seems to be some minor issue with refreshing the 'star' when marking is triggered by double tap. Expected behavior: the 'marked' start is updated to reflect the 'marked' status of the card.

		Hi. You have the great whiteboard feature. Once you click show answer, give the option to add the drawn graphics to the answer section of the card.

		The scenario / motivation : Let's say that I have an S Note document with 20 pages (landscape), each representing a back page of a card. Right now, I have to import each of the images of those pages into AnkiDroid manually, which is quite cumbersome as I have to sift through my gallery for each one. It would be great if I could do the following (the bold steps would have to be newly implemented): Push the &quot;Share with&quot; button and select the page(s) to be exported as image file(s) in S Note. Select AnkiDroid as the receiving app in the &quot;Share with&quot; dialogue AnkiDroid opens its &quot;Add note&quot; mask, where the (first/nth) image is already entered into the &quot;back&quot; field. Manually enter my question into the &quot;front&quot; field and save the note. In case there are multiple pages, go back to step 3. Receiving multiple images at once should be doable, as I can send multiple pages from S Note to GMail in one step whithout problems. This would be a really practical feature for me, but what do you think? Would this be something that you would see as useful and/or feasible new feature for AnkiDroid, too? Sadly, I do not know enough about Java and Android development to try and implement it myself. All I could find was this Android developer page, but I don't know if this is a feasible approach and/or the right way to do it. Thank you for this great app - I've been using it for two semesters now and it has already helped me a lot!

			<description>
		Sometimes it happens that whenever I'm studying a deck, the media volume goes up by a bit for every sound that the cards play, so after some 10 sounds my volume is at the max unless I keep lowering it, which in any case is really annoying. From what I could gather, every time this happens, it's right after using a podcast app (AntennaPod), also open source, and it happens in about 4 out of 5 times after using such app (sometimes, mysteriously, everything works fine). The only sure way I found to avoid it is to open the Play Music app and start playing something (although I believe any other music app would have a similar effect) in between using AntennaPod and Ankidroid. This is actually a further indication that the problem is most likely with the podcast app, but at the same time it's intriguing that a single app, on a system that strives to keep everything running independently, would be able to unintentionally interfere with the behavior of another. I'm using a Nexus 5, unrooted. This issue was present in both Lollipop and Marshmallow versions. I'm willing to dig into this issue myself, inspecting the code for both apps, but any helpful insights would be greatly appreciated.

		Hi, on my eink device I would love to stop animated GIFs, without having to recreate the deck with new non-animated media. Could we have a setting to disable GIF animations? AnkiDroid uses Chrome to display the web stuff in the cards, correct? I'm not sure how simple it is. I remember years ago there was an eink setting I think, but I can't see it now. Has this been made redundant and not needed? I think it may still be useful, maybe a fullscreen refresh every X cards displayed, etc. Thanks

		Trying to understand if this is a bug or not. So, on the left is a screenshot pre-studying (i.e., zero cards studied today). On the right is a screenshot after about 20 mins of studying. What's caught my attention is it says &quot;25 cards studied ...&quot;. But if you look at the original numbers, shouldn't that number be around 45? Now another picture On the left I am studying and the review due count is 159. I hit the back button and the review due count drops down to 155. (removed content of card on left) So are there cards being buried, or is something else happening? It's very confusing having things like mismatched due numbers and &quot;cards studied&quot;, or due counts that drop 4 cards in the span of 1 second. Please explain (thank you)

		I have created add-on for Anki that saves depth information from LaTeX and then apply it to images when they are displayed. You can look it at AnkiWeb or just see it's code at GitHub Gist. Now, I want to port it to AnkiDroid so I would see beautifully aligned images on all my devices. However, I have some problems with porting because I'm not familiar with AnkiDroid code. First, if you see my code in Gist, you will found that I have wrapped Anki methods with my own functions which modifies their output, but there is no such tool in AnkiDroid. I can just patch already existing methods like matshch/Anki-Android@762717329e4d886ca00714f234f58bf0e95181c6 but I'm not sure is it OK or we should create some other way to do this. Other trouble is enabling of this patch. I think it should be some option in settings like done for FEN, but how to implement it? Enabling of FEN just installs hook... Other way is to not create options and to check depth info every time and just ignore lack of this files. Maybe I should create a filter on result of required methods? Then, it will be easy to solve both problems. What do you think about it? 😕 1

		&quot;Deck Options&quot; should be simply another setting and belong under the &quot;Settings&quot; menu. What is the rationale for hiding it inside an individual Deck? If I change anything in &quot;Deck Options&quot; it is changed for ALL decks - the definition of a global settings. It was always wrong but now with the latest changes to Anki it's even worse. If you have studied all your cards for the day you can't enter a deck anymore. Therefore you can't change the global settings for, say, new cards until tomorrow, when the decks become available again. Or you have to create a temporary deck, enter it, change the &quot;Deck Option&quot;, and then delete the temporary deck. This is plainly wrong.

		Before the revamp Ankidroid would show, for each deck, how many new cards the deck had in total. That information was very useful, it told me when new cards were running low and I needed to prepare new ones. Now that information is gone. Please bring it back. Thanks.

		Dear all, first of all thanks for developing this great piece of software. Recently I found out about the https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki note type and added it to my desktop anki. Now AnkiDroid crashes as soon as I try to sync and as soon as I start AnkiDroid again it crashes again. Only resetting AnkiDroid, deleting the collection, removing the note type on my desktop version and then syncing the collection without beforementioned notetype to AnkiDroid makes it work again. Thanks

		Currently AnkiDroid (with night mode enabled) makes a white background flickering each time a card is changed to the next. It's very irritating and defeats the purpose of a night mode option. What steps will reproduce the problem? Open normal study for any deck in night mode and go thought the cards. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Black colored background always. A white flickering background each time I press next card or show answer. Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it happen only one time? Yes. Happens always. What version of AnkiDroid are you using? 2.6 alpha 30 I know from others' reports this issue has been reopen multiples times since version 2.0.1

		AnkiDroid 2.6 modified the behavior of the clear whiteboard button. Previously it cleared the entire whiteboard (what I'd like to have back), now it removes the last stroke. I'm studying Kanji with the whiteboard and for me it doesn't make sense to clear the last stroke. It's easier to write the whole thing again. That would happen when writing with a pen anyway. Make it configurable in the settings please. Thank you. Maybe make long press clear the whole board or something.

Expected Result To act normally Note: I think for a situation like this the matching first field which was turning completely pink/red was better like in the early versions.

		hey there, I think It's annoying that videos are being played automatically when new card appears(If added to the Front), there must be an option to disable that.(separate from audio auto play). Regards.

		I am new to Anki, and I just figure out how to align left for all the cards. Open desktop version, click on a card in browse, and click &quot;cards&quot;, it will open a window that will have some styling code. In the styling box, change &quot;text-align: center&quot; to &quot;text-align: left&quot;. I am wondering if we could do the same thing on AnkiDroid app. Something like vertically align center. Add a new option for the alignment where users can set it center or left. It would be nice to have this enhancement.

		I have a deck with two card types where every note has exactly two cards. &quot;Bury related new cards until tomorrow&quot; is unchecked. Learning steps are default. The deck is newly added from scheduling-less apkg and hasn't been used before. Anki Desktop behavior: Do 30 new cards in under 10 minutes on fresh deck. Start getting shown previously new cards that are now in the learning phase, on their 10 minute step, before their scheduled moment in time has passed. They're shown in a seemingly random order. Ankidroid behavior: Do the same thing. They're shown in the same order I originally saw them in. Behavior difference is the same after waiting more than 10 minutes to make the cards all be due instead of ahead schedule.

		Sir When we check media sometimes it says for example 10 media used by cards but aren't in media folder or says 10 media are in media folder that aren't used by any cards In these two cases it's highly needed for a creator of a deck to see which is which I mean if I have 900 cards and 10 media aren't in media folder and 20 media aren't used by any cards if I could be able to see which media aren't used and which cards are using missed media it wouldn't be needed to check all these 900 cards to find which card can't play audio Sometimes audio's incorrect name or card's incorrect content caused these two problems If u add a list of these media or these cards that don't have media You simply have removed a burden I just thought u can add this feature in card browsing by adding a tag like other tags or make it visible in another color

		Ankidroid is not handeling the Review Ceiling correctly. Example: There are 500 Cards to be reviewed. The user caps this to 50 Cards per day. The user reviews these 50 cards, he knows them, and all of them should reappear the next day because he clicked on &quot;Good&quot; and it was set to 1 day. BUT the 50 cards do not reappear, instead all other 450 cards appear before the 50 cards during the next few days This is a huge issue for the learning process. I say that the last reviewed card must have priority over the cards that are untouched for weeks or months. (They only appear first because Ankidroid is only checking the Due date of the cards) So if you would wan't to see the 50 cards again, you would need to turn off the Ceiling and click through every card that needs to be reviewed. I believe this is not the purpose of such a ceiling... Please review this as soon as possible because it's an actual flaw

I'd like to be able to quickly check with a dictionary app whether the word/phrase is actually a valid one. Being able to copy/share it straight from the Study screen would be very handy for that, but since currently the furigana is mixed with the kanji, it has to be cleaned up first. My current work-around for that is to open the Edit Note screen, select all in the field, and copy it. A Tasker task is listening for clipboard changes, and when a new text that matches the \[\p{Hira}+\] regex is copied, the task strips all spaces and furigana annotations. Then I paste it in a dictionary. I can't do such thing straight from Study screen, as furigana is not marked as such, it looks exactly like regular kana that might be part of the word/phrase. It would be nice if furigana is omitted when copying text from Study screen.

		Hoping this is the right place to do a feature request, sorry if it isn't. I'm using AnkiDroid to study vocabulary, and to thin the deck when there is a term I know well I supend the note; I'd love to have a way to check from time to time all the suspended notes, to put back in the deck the ones I don't remember anymore. It there isn't a way to do something like these (I didn't find it), would it be possible to add it?

		Currently, if I set &quot;Center align&quot; the bottom content of my cards is commonly covered by the keyboard once activated (Google Handwriting is esp. huge) don't set &quot;Center align&quot; the content has both its top parts hidden behind Anki's top bar once a keyboard activates and is (ofc) too far up. Thus as a compromise I'd like to ask for an option to bias &quot;Center align&quot;. Eg, select a value between -50% and 50% (of app height), with negative values pushing the center up and positive ones pushing it down.

		With Anki 2.6.1 (just updated to 2.7 and have no opportunity to check on new version) if hold on desk select Deck options select New Card select Steps (in minutes) enter 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 20 or similar pattern leave out of all option menus start learning new card After showing card I type Good (1 min), after 1 min I have only choice to type Good (20 min). All equal learning intervals collapsed into single and I am prompted to check next non-equal interval. NOTE Red indicator of card in learning correctly updated after checking Good (20 min). So if I have seven 1 min intervals it decreased by 7 )) New research http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2011_Karpicke_Bauernschmidt_JEPLMC.pdf showed that there is no any improvements with using increasing delays between showing cards (for learning during the day). Only repetition count and total session duration have role (the more is better). I started discussion on this topic at http://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/questions/2344/repetition-interval-during-initial-learning-within-a-day and https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/57zdtu/what_learning_steps_interval_you_used_for/ I try to use divide duration of my typical learning session into equal intervals and trapped to this error. I actually use 5 15 15 15 120 pattern. I should see card 3 times during in my typical 1 hour session and later see it in the evening or next day. But I see it only once. As word-around I set interval pattern to 5 20 15 10 120 which work as expected.

		Issue: I copied Chinese phrases out of a pdf file into Anki (Desktop) and synced with my Ankidroid. In the Ankidroid version, sometimes there are characters missing in the phrase - the whole phrase shows up in the Editing mode for my card, but not in the preview card, in the preview card there is only a space - If I copy that space to somewhere else, it shows me the character... naturally I thought it has something to do with the fonts - I changed fonts and card type - but it did not help - The Desktop Version can handle it normally... but not the Ankidroid Version. Reproduction Steps Download this PDF File 1. Text_Teil1_Masterübersetzung.pdf Copy the first Sentence in Anki, Sync with Ankidroid Check the Preview and the Editing Mode Expected Result: The Preview should exactly show the Sentence I copied Actual Result: A Few Characters are indeed missing.

I understand that this isn't possible in the droid version. Looking at the rich adding media possibilities though, I don't understand why it isn't possible to add a text field as attachment. My experience with language cards is that with any non trivial vocabulary, an example is compulsory for a thorough comprehension. So I'd like to suggest to add an example field by default, or a text field as media attachment. It feels like such a feature must have been asked in the past but I couldn't find a corresponding issue.

		In this file (MediaSyncer.java), starting from line 153, is the code for sync media files that is marked as deleted on server:                         if (ldirty != 0) {
                        mCol.log(&quot;delete local&quot;);
                        mCol.getMedia().syncDelete(fname);
                    } else {
                        // conflict: local add overrides remote delete
                        mCol.log(&quot;conflict; will send&quot;);
                    }
                } else {
                    // deleted both sides
                    mCol.log(&quot;both sides deleted&quot;);
                    mCol.getMedia().markClean(Collections.singletonList(fname));
                }
 And I have found the counterpart from anki pc client (sync.py line 775):                 if not ldirty:
                    self.col.log(&quot;delete local&quot;)
                    self.col.media.syncDelete(fname)
                else:
                    # conflict; local add overrides remote delete
                    self.col.log(&quot;conflict; will send&quot;)
            else:
                # deleted both sides
                self.col.log(&quot;both sides deleted&quot;)
                ldirty and self.col.media.markClean([fname])
 AFAIK, if(ldirty != 0) seems to be just the opposite of if not dirty. This makes it is nearly impossible to sync a file deletion to ankidroid (not a big problem, though). Hope you can fix this on next release. Thanks :)

		By using the MessagEase keyboard I fell in principle fast enough to type on my phone to answer cards that need typing. Unfortunately the keyboard doesn't automatically popup when I open a new card with a typing speed. Always having to click on the text field needs time that's unecessary. I would prefer if the text field would get automatically focused and the keyboard would expand.

To replicate the bug you need to have more than one deck grouped in a folder (to get that you only have to put a common prefix and ::, for example language::English and language::Spanish) When you review today's new cards of one of the deck then sometimes all the new cards of the other deck have disappeared in the process of reviewing the first deck. Obviously this have no sense. Did someone ever experience the same? I hope, I had explained it clear.

I don't think it said anywhere that the collection is corrupted, but it seems to me that it is corrupted because I have well over 150 &quot;old&quot; questions scheduled every day, and after this crash, I had zero &quot;old&quot; questions scheduled. Only some brand new questions showed up. This happened two days (2017-02-12) and yesterday (2017-02-13) and I seem to be able to reproduce this any day now. Before Feb 12, this never happened to me.

		Hi, guys! First of all thanks a lot for such a marvelous app! About my problem, in a word I can't figure out what's actually wrong but it seems like there is a bug in database. I've attached a couple of files. So when I add a new card, for example I type a word 'Pizza' in the first line and when I open up that card I see in the same line 'Pizza шлю'. This junk 'шлю' also appeared in many cards that have been in database for long time and I changed nothing in the ones, but now they all have the same stuff. How do you think what the cause may be in this case? I've tried to look up the data from db2 but some files are encrypted. Anyway thanks in advance! My phone is Meizu MX4 PRO, FLYME 6.0.2.0 OS, Android version 5.1.1

		I'm so happy with the results of an addon I made for Anki Desktop for my study - https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/11767883 It shows the least overdue learning cards first, which is the opposite to the normal behaviour. This is done because when I mark a card &quot;again&quot;, I don't want to see it in 2 minutes or 30 seconds, I want to see it in 3 seconds, or I'll forget it, so I need to ensure old &quot;learning&quot; cards don't pop up before it. I love this change to my study so much, I've been prefering the desktop app over the android, it would be great if I could have the desktop app on my phone. Or even better, can I somehow change the code and have in Ankidroid?

This might perhaps be reused also to create cards ? This would really simplify the usage of drawings for learning. Thanks for considering this.

		This was invalid notification so I edited it. But I have one remark: I see there is an option: &quot;Fetch media on sync&quot; - By default, AnkiDroid will sync sounds and images as well as your cards and review history. If you disable this option, sounds and images will not be synced by AnkiDroid. I didn't understand what fatch exactly mean. But now I think that you can consider add information to Ankidroid manual that it affect both download and upload. And you can also mention that there is an option for that in Anki desktop https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankiweb/2289-synch-with-ankiweb-excluding-media?unresolve=true This might help other users to better understand manual than I did.

When I am done thinking about a card, the phone is usually already locked because of the screen timeout. Of course this can be avoided by increasing the timeout or using the Anki function to never turn off the screen. I have used this option for some time now but I noticed that keeping the screen on reduces battery life while learning quite a lot. Feature request It would be great if there was an option to display Anki on top of the lockscreen - so I can turn off the display while thinking on a card and do not need to enter my password again for the next card.

Under a &quot;Study targets dashboard&quot; you could create the following study target. Name &quot;Organic Chemistry Exam&quot; Target Date &quot;1/1/18&quot; Days left &quot;x&quot; Current predicted % &quot;34%&quot; &quot;I want to have [70%] of my cards to be &quot;mature&quot; by [1/1/18] when my exam is. I can devote a maximum of [1.5 hours] per day to revise. My study material consists of [399] [pages] (/modules/chapters). To date I have created cards for [4] pages.&quot; &quot;The decks that this applies to is [Organic Chemistry] and all sub-decks&quot; The data contained within this paragraph would let Anki predict how many cards will be created by the end of the study material ((Number of cards to date/4)*399). Using the built in probabilistic prediction algorithm and the % target requirements you could back fit the latest date by which all the study material needs to be converted into cards and so the minimum amount of study material that needs to be converted into cards per day. By using the amount of revision time available per day, user data to date and the prediction algorithm it would allow Anki to limit the number of cards that could be studied per day (for optimal recall you cannot have spikes that would require hours worth of study that is not available, this happens alot to me at the moment). This would mean the cards available to be learned would need to be staggered. You could also warn if 1.5 hours is not sufficient and recommend a new value. This would be useful and make Anki less demoralising and optimised (avoid sub-optimal card spikes where the time simply isn't available to optimally learn the cards).

		in the previous versions of ankidroid (i mean version 2.3) to import an apkg file we placed it in the phone memory card and by clicking on it, it started to import because the spkg file was recognized by ankidroid. but in the new versions by clicking on a apkg file the message &quot;application not available ' appears which means that the apkg file is not recognized by ankidroid and we should put the apkg file in ankidroid folder and then import it. since clicking on apkg to import it is very good option can you apply this again in new versions?

		The Advanced Statistics setting (&quot;Predictive Forecast&quot;) gives an incorrect &quot;Study&quot; count per day when you have subdecks. The algorithm should take into account that a max new cards setting for a deck is a global maximum for all of the subdecks. For example, if I have a parent deck with a setting of max 20 new cards and two subdecks with a setting of 20 each, it will display as 60 cards due every day. This is incorrect, and the user would never see more than 20 on any given day due to the limit set by the parent decks setting. Steps to reproduce: Enable &quot;Advanced Statistics&quot; Create a new deck &quot;Foo&quot; with 20 new cards (make sure max new cards setting is 20) Create a new subdeck &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; with 20 new cards (make sure max new cards setting is 20) Go to the &quot;Statistics&quot; / &quot;Forecast&quot; screen Behaviour: The diagram shows 40 cards as being due today, and none tomorrow. Expected behaviour: The diagram shows 20 cards as being due today, and 20 tomorrow.

Either that, or an option to choose the time of day to cycle cards would be nice.

		I have followed all recommended research steps, and simply elided them for a more concise report Reproduction: git fork / clone / build / run on emulator that has never run ankidroid before (master/HEAD as of time of this bug report) AnkiDroid crashes on startup Useful(?) portion of stack trace: E/CollectionHelper: Could not initialize AnkiDroid directory com.ichi2.anki.exception.StorageAccessException: No write access to AnkiDroid directory at com.ichi2.anki.CollectionHelper.initializeAnkiDroidDirectory(CollectionHelper.java:175) at com.ichi2.anki.CollectionHelper.getCol(CollectionHelper.java:91) at com.ichi2.anki.services.BootService.scheduleDeckReminder(BootService.java:47) at com.ichi2.anki.services.BootService.onHandleIntent(BootService.java:39) at android.app.IntentService$ServiceHandler.handleMessage(IntentService.java:66) Workaround: If you manually go into Android settings for the app and grant permissions, it works Thoughts: On first inspection I was unable to see where AnkiDroid asks for permission in the code. Either way, on first startup it seems it should attempt to ask the user if it may have the permissions it needs, and if it doesn't have them it should give a nice error message prior to closing rather than a crash. You can reproduce this easily on a device that has AnkiDroid already by doing the parallel build process (but it appears with a clean local build as well!) Please tell me if I'm just missing something obvious, otherwise, I could also accept nudges towards how to implement a permission-request-on-first-run plus a graceful-message-then-close thing

This only happens if it is the last letter of a word and doesn't always occur. I believe in some dialects of Arabic (e.g. Egyptian) &quot;yaa&quot; is often written as &quot;alif maqsura&quot; - so not sure if this is machine behavior trying to compensate. This is not correct behavior in formal Arabic. It may appear as &quot;alif maqsura&quot; on the answer card even if the answer is written as &quot;yaa&quot; (see pictures). Link - https://imgur.com/a/A2qoU You can see that the answer appears differently from how it has been inputted in the &quot;edit note&quot;, namely it is missing two dots below the final character.

		I have a deck of Japanese with cards Kanji → Meaning, Kanji → Reading, Meaning → Reading and Meaning → Kanji. I've noticed I reviewed new cards (not in random order) much much faster than I do review cards. I think one of the reasons is that new cards are (by the burying mechanism) almost always sorted by card type: first the Meaning → Reading cards, then the Kanji → Reading cards, etc. This causes less “context switches”, and the brain concentrates more on the vocabulary and less on “on what language is it? what was the answer I am expected to give?” So I was thinking it may be a good idea to be able to sort review cards based on card type, grouping cards of the same type in the reviews. What do you think about it? (I'll open the same issue on anki-desktop's repo based on the outcome of this discussion, as I'm mostly using ankidroid for reviews)

This is not correct, as the Master::A deck has a 2 new cards limit.

		Hello everybody, I'm a Chinese user of Anki android version, I have an issue with TTS, I use Anki to memorize English vocabulary, I have installed google TTS for making the Anki can pronounce the word when I memorize the words. After I set the Google TTS as the main TTS engine It works, but it doesn't work very well. When I restart to use Anki, There is a message show in the Anki, &quot;No text-to-speech language available&quot;, all I have to do is that to set Google TTS as the main TTS engine again, and after that the problem will come back again after several minutes, so I have to do the setting again and again. Is there anyone has the same problem as mine? what should I do to solve the problem? many thanks

I'm trying to use the AnkiDroid API in a personal project based on the sample provided at: https://github.com/ankidroid/apisample The API is working fine except for the findDuplicateNotes function. I'm trying to detect all duplicates I have stored in a file but it is not detecting all the duplicates. In a list of 2000 cards, it finds approximately 1100 duplicates (the remaining 900 are not detected even if they are already in the deck). I have been trying to debug my project (based on the sample) and debugging also the Anki-Android APP, and as far as I have been able to understand, the problem seems related to a hashcode calculation that was already solved in this commit: 269fd17 In fact, I have seen the source code of the latest version of the API that I'm referencing: https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/ichi2/anki/api/1.1.0alpha5/ And I see that the affected files are not updated... I think that publishing the current version of the API should solve the problem ¿Can you please update the published API? In case it is not possible, ¿Could you suggest any workaround to use the latest version of the API in my project or how to point to the git version in the gradle file? (I have been trying to build the current version of the API to a JAR in my machine and then reference it in my project, but by the moment I was unable to make it work... I think I need to understand better the dependencies and build system in order to do this.. :)) Expected Result When searching a duplicated card the key &quot;熊, くま&quot; (for example) it should find 1 result in my deck (since I have already added this card) Actual Result The card is not detected as duplicated and I can add it over and over again Debug info AnkiDroid Version = Any (the problem is with the API) AnkiDroid API Version = 1.1.0alpha5 Android Version = 7.0.0 Key searched for duplicates: &quot;熊, くま&quot; Wrong hashcode obtained by the published 1.1.0alpha5 version of the API: 4081968894 Right hashcode obtained by the latest version of the AP in github: 255123055 (which seems it should work)
