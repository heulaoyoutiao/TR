		I'm a long time user of k-9... Never any problems on several phones through the years. My Samsung s3 was getting a bit slow earlier, (wasn't using k-9 by the way) so I rebooted. Very shortly I needed to reference an email from last week, so I went to k-9. The first thing I noticed was my icons on the screen (I have shortcuts to each account as I have multiples) were missing and just a white mail folder was in their place... Even the name is gone and replaced with &quot;k-9 mail&quot; I tapped on each one and everything is gone. My color theme, all my folders, emails, accounts, EVERYTHING!!! The only thing that shows up is a bar at the top that says &quot;show unread count for...&quot; And two selections, one says &quot;unified inbox&quot; and &quot;all messages&quot;. Clicking on either of these brings up a &quot;busy&quot; screen but nothing happens at all. If I click the back arrow at the top, it takes me to the welcome screen as if I've just installed k-9. Also back on the home screen, the text under the white Mail icon changes from &quot;k-9 mail&quot; to &quot;all messages&quot; I also opened up k-9 from the actual icon in the apps folder and it takes me directly to the welcome screen. All my other apps seem to be working just fine... Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Jimmy If I go into application manager, it shows the following... Total: 6.28mb Application: 6.14mb USB Storage app: 0.00mb Data: 140kb Sd card: 0.00mb. (I have no ad card in the phone) The sprint s3 info...

		Hi there, k-9 seems to changes the MIME type of S/MIME signed mails in com.fsck.k9.mailstore.LocalFolder.java from: multipart/signed -&gt; whole mail text/plain -&gt; text part application/pkcs7-signature -&gt; signature part into this: multipart/mixed -&gt; whole mail multipart/alternative -&gt; text part application/pkcs7-signature -&gt; signature part I don't think this behaviour is intended.

			<description>
		Good evening @k9mail developers! While I am still waiting for Dark Mail (website) to come out, I have switched to ProtonMail for now, which offers a double encryption using RSA-2048 and AES-256 as described in their security features. Even though they're developing their service with heart-blood and have a GitHub account @ProtonMail, their source code is not available (yet). Nevertheless, I would love to be able to use ProtonMail through the k-9 interface on my mobile device. Means, k-9 would need to support that double encryption. Can you add this feature, please?

		The search in k-9 is sensitive to spaces. &quot;foo &quot; will not find emails where &quot;foo&quot; is a the end of the line with a line break afterwards. Given that Android's autocomplete puts a space immediately after the word when you select something, it would be nice to have a trim() -like call on the search field before executing the search.

		My friend is no longer able to decrypt newly sent messages using K-9 mail 5.005 with OpenKeyChain 3.2 on Android 4.4.3. I took a look at some messages from my friend and they were only encrypted with the public key of the recipient, and not the key of the sender. I'm not sure if this is a bug that should be filed on OpenKeyChain's side, I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this.

		If webview is completely removed from device (I am talking about removing libwebviewchromium.so), k9 mail crashes when one is trying to open a message. Is this fundamentally in design or this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Many, including myself, think that google webview is a non essential layer that represents a glaring security hole for the entire OS with very limited benefits for a user. Is there a way to break that reliance? I guess this could be done via a general intent calling an avalable web browser, such as firefox or fennec.

		The following bug appears fixed in latest development version (v5.107). Since I could not find anything clearly related to this on changelogs, I report this just for confirmation. I'm on a Samsung S4 (I9505) running stock Android v5.0.1. Using K-9 v5.006, a read status change (and even deletion) applied on a different device is not entirely propagated to mobile: the &quot;new mail&quot; notification would not automatically disappear, even after manual pull/refresh. This problem is not limited to lock screen, but to status-bar and notifications-menu too, where the notification would reside in indefinitely. Opening this dead notification, in case of email deletion, leads to an empty message dated to Unix epoch time (1970). I tried the latest development version (5.107) and can confirm this problem is fixed. Thanks for the great work.

My coding experience is not extensive, but I'm ready to spend the time necessary to figure out how to do this if no one else is working on it and if it's not a horribly advanced project.

POP3 does not have folders. (The local client can have folders but the server does not. This is one of the reasons why IMAP has become much more widely used.)

		I had this happening twice on my own debug-build of k-9 version 5.106. At first I though it was somehow related to my changes (see pull request #725), but I can reproduce it with a build from master branch, corresponding to v 5.106. It works on 5.006, official version, instead. All other messages display fine, apart from these two sent by the same sender (my dentist 😏 ) and hence formatted similarly. The message is in MIME multipart, with the text in HTML format and three images attached and transferred in Base64. K-9 tells me that there is a new message in my inbox and I can see the message heading in the message view. When I try to open it, the view is completely blank. Well, I reproduced it with adb/logcat on and you can reed the exception below. So in summary: It is reproducible It happens on builds from trunk it looks like a bug the same message displays fine on the official 5.006 version from Google play I am happy to try to fix it in the coming weeks if no one is available.

		I have a pop3 account in K-9. I synchronize mails in K-9 while I have more mails on the server side than K-9 will download. I now delete 5 messages from K-9. I sync again, if the mails on the server side stayed the same, K-9 will now download mails from/at the old end. Presumably to reach its quota of mails. A notification is then also put out for these old mails which can be confusing. Fix: do not download mails that are older than the oldest mail already in an account.

		When our mail host was moved to RackSpace, I was not able to send mail from K-9 on some of my Android devices while using the LTE connection. If I enabled wi-fi, the mail was sent, otherwise, I would get an error message saying that mail could not be sent. This did not happen before our mail server moved. I read something about ipv6, and noticed that my T-Mobile connection was using an ipv6 access point. When I changed the protocol used by the access point to ipv4 (I was surprised I was able to do this), the send errors stopped. For now, this workaround works, but at some point carriers may not allow the use of ipv4. I do not know if this is only a problem with RackSpace, but it has happened on every Android device I have used when connected to an ipv6 LTE WAP.

		Hallo since long this issue in k9mail is present: when I open k9mail through a mail notification in the info bar, when having any other app opened, and after reading that mail, I go back with the Back-Key, then this won't bring me to the last opened app (from where I opened the notification), this brings me to the home screen. This is not the normal behaviour I think, other apps don't &quot;forget&quot; from where they have been started. The same thing is, when I have an app open and I open now k9mail through some kind of gesture (there are several apps doing this, e.g. &quot;Swapps&quot;). I open k9 now and when I go back with the back button, the original app has gone, I come to the home screen. The same issue I found with Threema, I guess it is the same bug. But most other apps will bring me to the last screen (when I press the backbutton), from where they had been started, either through notification shortcut or other way I opened them, always I come back with the back button to the previous screen of any previous opened app. Thank frank

		This is not a technical question, but I'm curious if this blurb from Kaiten mail is correct: &quot;Kaiten is based on the popular open source app K-9 Mail and was built by K-9's lead developers Jesse and Chris. By buying Kaiten you not only get an awesome email client, you also support the open source version because almost all of the new features are contributed to K-9 Mail.&quot; K-9 has seen many new releases, Kaiten seems abandoned. Are the lead developers noted above part of the current K-9 team or did I give my money to random hucksters?

		This problem is happening on a Samsung running OS 4.4.4, and a Droid Turbo running OS 5.1. This problem occurs using IMAP with EITHER polling or IDLE. This problem occurs on 3G, 4G, and multiple internet connections. This problem occurs with multiple e-mail providers. If the connection is used every minute (either via e-mails coming in, going out, etc., or by a poll or IDLE refresh), the connection is fine. If the polling or IDLE refresh is set to anything longer than a minute, and no e-mails come in or go out, the connection stops working. Once the connection has gone unused for over a minute, any attempt to do anything with the connection (poll, send e-mail, delete an existing email) will cause K9 mail to hang up (the application still responds, but it is stuck trying to communicate with the server). I did force close K9 after waiting 25 minutes for it to give up trying to communicate with the server and/or throw an error. Once it was force stopped and re-opened, the following error was in the error folder: java.net.SocketException: recvfrom failed: ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out) at libcore.io.IoBridge.maybeThrowAfterRecvfrom(IoBridge.java:592) at libcore.io.IoBridge.recvfrom(IoBridge.java:556) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.read(PlainSocketImpl.java:485) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.access$000(PlainSocketImpl.java:37) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl$PlainSocketInputStream.read(PlainSocketImpl.java:237) at java.io.InputStream.read(InputStream.java:162) at java.io.BufferedInputStream.fillbuf(BufferedInputStream.java:149) at java.io.BufferedInputStream.read(BufferedInputStream.java:234) at com.fsck.k9.mail.filter.PeekableInputStream.peek(PeekableInputStream.java:34) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapResponseParser.readResponse(ImapResponseParser.java:42) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapResponseParser.readResponse(ImapResponseParser.java:29) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapConnection.readStatusResponse(ImapStore.java:2775) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapConnection.executeSimpleCommand(ImapStore.java:2925) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapFolder.executeSimpleCommand(ImapStore.java:862) at com.fsck.k9.mail.store.ImapStore$ImapFolderPusher$1.run(ImapStore.java:3151) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:818) Caused by: android.system.ErrnoException: recvfrom failed: ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out) at libcore.io.Posix.recvfromBytes(Native Method) at libcore.io.Posix.recvfrom(Posix.java:185) at libcore.io.BlockGuardOs.recvfrom(BlockGuardOs.java:250) at libcore.io.IoBridge.recvfrom(IoBridge.java:553) ... 14 more 👍 1

		This was tested with K-9 mail v5.007 and both OpenKeychain / APG under AlienDalvik / AOSP 4.1.2: Replying to an encrypted Mail quotes the encrypted Mail still encrypted. I always wondered why K-9 mail only offers the menu entry &quot;Reply&quot; in the mail list view inside a folder, but not when viewing an individual email. This does not really matter (it is merely an inconvenience), as long as the intent is to reply to an unencrypted email. But for encrypted emails that results in the email's content being quoted encrypted, effectively rendering replies to encrypted emails useless. Or is this just either an oversight by me or the fact, that I run K9-Mail in SailfishOS's AlienDalvik (based on AOSP 4.1.2)? Kudos for your excellent work, Olf0

		Being notified that the mail accounts are being checked isn't very useful for most people. Generally people only care when they actually get new messages, not every time the server is queried.

If I delete all of my Inbox messages then choose to &quot;Empty Trash&quot; does that delete all of the messages in my Inbox on the server them empty the server trash? That seems to be happening. There is nothing in your settings or explanations that indicate that should be happening. I am trying to keep my phones Inbox clean, and save the messages on the server.

		Maybe is it a translation issue : When creating an account with the french version of K9mail, the default folder where are stored sent emails is &quot;Envoyés&quot;. Most email readers actually use the &quot;Sent&quot; folder but display a translated name for this folder in the UI : &quot;Envoyés&quot; or &quot;Messages envoyés&quot;. If they do, all email client using IMAP consequently have a common default configuration (and, for part of them, default configuration is the only configuration :( ). I have seen that I can choose the folder to save sent emails in, but it took me time to figure out what was happening, as, in the first place, it took me time to discover that I was having a problem.

		Android 4.4.2 All K9 versions since 18 months HTC One M8 When a message contains an URL link, tapping on it works best is message is zoomed out (when text is small). The more you zoom in to be able to read content of message, the less chance you have to get link open on tapping it. I have tried to tap at begin of link, end, first line, last line ... it just won't open. This is specific to K9. It's not a tactile issue, because I never had that problem in an web browser.

		Android 4.4.2 HTC One M8 K9 5.007 In folder listing view. When I want to select one message, the first message I want to select, I need to tap on the small box on left on line. For following messages, I can tap anywhere in the line, near the box, or not. The issue is that I have to tap exactly in the middle of the tick box. If I tap just above, below, or left of the box, by a few pixels, the message will open, in the read view. The graphic of the tick box is fine, but the tactile space should not be exactly matching the graphics; the tactile zone should be larger than the graphics, and selection should start when I tap any place near the box; the tactile zone should be as large as the height of the message line (this height may vary with DPI). The graphic box is centered vertically; the tactile zone should spread over the full height of line, and at least as large as the height. But maybe, the tactilke zone should (maybe, debatable) go to the left edge.

		Expected behaviour From an email in K9, Click open for the .ics attachment. (the .ics is from my office, where they generate the calendar events from an outlook office calendar). I would than choose &quot;Calendar&quot; , and than I would have have a window in the resident default calendar app with the calendar event and can work with the calendar event and save it to a particular calendar account and add alarms and such. This was working correctly for about a year. Actual behaviour Now, after 1 or two K9 updates (started being a problem a few months ago IIRC)... was hoping the latest update would fix the problem, but it did not. After clicking on &quot;Calendar&quot;, I get an OS window that says &quot; Unfortunately, Calendar has stopped.&quot; Steps to reproduce Send an outlook generated .ics to an email account in K9. In the email, Click &quot;Show attachments&quot; , than &quot;more&quot; if need be, than click &quot;Open&quot;. Select &quot;Calendar&quot;. At this point I get the OS message window &quot; Unfortunately, Calendar has stopped. &quot; I am using the Calendar that comes with my phone / OS, not a 3rd party downloaded calendar. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.008 Android version: Galaxy 6 model SM-G920V OS: 5.1.1 kernel 3.10.61 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): POP3

		I would like to see a feature in K-9 to allow me to use &quot;Tasker&quot; to check a specific account email. Scenario is : Go to work attach to work wifi, Tasker recognizes we are at work based on Access point and starts periodically checking for email for just the work email account. Same scenario at home. Let Tasker check for home email while at home. This is allows better security as it only is trying to check my accounts in the appropriate networks and not just any ole wifi I connect too. Also this is a great app, thanks for all the work that has been put into it.

		An alias file (not necessarily populated by k9) similar to that used by mutt would be referenced when autocompleting email addresses. this would be a nice stepping stone to the smarter autocomplete feature requests. love k9! gave it 5 stars on the play store.

		Could you please add a support for creating calendar events from an ICS attachment? I can currently Open or Save an attached ICS file but I cannot create an event from it. Google Calendar has this feature so in my particular case, I can work around the lacking K9 functionality by opening the attachment in K9, choosing Google Calendar and creating the event from there. Thanks

			<description>
		Hello, having some battery consumption issues since I upgraded from Stock/Kit Kat to Cyanogen13/Marshmallow I Googled about it. I read about pushing/polling possibly beeing related to the matter, but I think the wiki here is inconsistent and thus am I somewhat lost. From this page https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/Manual-AccountSetup Enable push mail for this account: This option is only available for IMAP accounts. When it is enabled a long-lived connection to the IMAP server is established so K-9 Mail can be notified by the server when a new message has arrived. When this is set, you do not need to select a poll frequency, because you do not poll. This generally decreases power consumption in addition to decreasing delivery notification delay, and is a good enough thing that it can be worth selecting a mailbox on the ground that the provider supports IMAP IDLE. Please note that Push might require multiple connections to the IMAP server which might not be supported or undesired by the server administration. From this page https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions What is the difference between pushing and polling? Depending on what type of account you have configured, K-9 may support either push or poll for fetching new mail (see Account settings &gt; Fetching mail). At this time, K-9 only supports push for IMAP accounts. Polling refers to the mail client periodically asking the mail server for new mail, on some configured time increment. Pushing refers to the mail client keeping an open connection to the mail server, so that the server can inform the client of new mail as soon as it is received. Pushing typically uses more battery for a few reasons. First, when you have any account configured to push, this keeps an Android service running at all times. This service keeps 1 open connection to the mail server for each folder configured to push (which also uses battery power). And lastly, pushing will typically lead to more frequent communications between the client and the server. Regards.

		Expected behaviour K9 should sync my mail account every 5 minutes. Actual behaviour During the night and somtimes irregularly during day, my account isn't synced. Instead it tells me that Auto-Sync had been disabled. By googling I found advices to turn Auto-Sync on in Settings &gt; Data usage. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S6 and there this option has been removed. The only place where I can disable Auto-Sync ist in Settings &gt; Accounts. But this option is not disabled with me, and apart from that you only disable syncing the defined accounts in Android. But K9 is not an account. Furthermore, there is the setting that I can enable background sync independent of Anroid's Auto-Sync option. But this doesn't work. Even if I set this option to always, it tells me that Auto-Sync had been disabled and refuses to sync my Accounts.

		Hi! The first time i've used K-9 mail (long long time ago) i remember that i was puzzled, &quot;How can i reply to this?&quot;. Then I found the &quot;Send -&gt; Reply&quot; menu. I think that is not really good from the viewpoint of user experience. I think the most used feature is the reply menu, that should have it's own button on the toolbar, it should not be hidden under a context menu's second option. So it would be good to think about which features are the most commonly used, and to put them to a higher visibility / easier to be reached point. Like: i never moved any emails of mine (thunderbird's filters doing that). Previous / Next mail should be a swipe to left / right and then it would free up two buttons on the bottom toolbar. Reply, Reply all could go to the right top maybe? Show headers, copy, move, refile (I'm not even sure what it does) mark unread could go to somewhere a bit out of sight, but still with the most used features (show headers, move) on the top. So, i thought i share my ideas with you, thank you for k-9 mail!

Surprisingly, I get less options in my tab which has actually got a bigger screen and a more empty space. See the picture for comparison.

		Expected behaviour SMTP helo handshake should succeed. In particular, when the current Android hostname is not a valid public ip address, some mechanism should be used to retrieve the public ip address the device is sending from. Actual behaviour Because K-9 Mail doesn't use a publicly resolvable hostname when identifying itself, some SMTP server might reject the connection. Steps to reproduce SMTP server (e.g. postfix): smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_helo_hostname reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname reject_unknown_helo_hostname Send an email from K-9 mail on a local-area-network such as a wifi.

		The current version of K9 (5.010) has several malfunctions/bugs in its notification function. Could you please have a look into this section of K9 and fix these bugs in a new version? Expected behavior With former versions of K9, it was possible, to delete any incoming mail directly from within its notification in the notification area, without opening K9 itself. This is managed by global settings &gt; notifications &gt; show “delete” button &gt; always. Actual behavior My new device is a Samsung Galaxy S7, running Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow). Here, independent of which setting I chose (“always” or “for single message notification”), it is no longer possible to directly delete incoming single mails through their notification. Steps to reproduce After several tests, I found out that the malfunction depends on the K9 language settings in global settings &gt; display &gt; language. I put it together with several screenshots in the attached file. K9 notifications.docx If language of K9 is set to “German” (which is my country), there is no option for deleting mails from within their notifications. Additional bugs when using “German” language setting: most often, the notifications even disappear from the notification area within 1 or 2 seconds and I have no chance to get information on incoming mails. if more than 1 messages have arrived in the same account, tapping on the notification always takes me to the latest incoming message, instead of going to the list of unread messages account settings &gt; notifications &gt; notification opens unread messages (is active) If language of K9 is set to “English”, I will be allowed to delete incoming mails from within their notifications, single mails as well as multiple mails. Additional bug when using “English” language setting: if more than 1 messages have arrived in the same account, tapping on the notification always takes me to the latest incoming message, instead of going to the list of unread messages account settings &gt; notifications &gt; notification opens unread messages (is active) Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Device: Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F)

When I reset the resolution to default, which is an unknown number of whatevers, the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons, and the Delete, Reply and Compose buttons all appear at the bottom. When I set it back to 360, the bottom toolbar disappears (so the Delete, Reply and Compose buttons disappear), but the Next, Previous and delete buttons then appear at the top of that screen. (Someone might reasonably say that if my changing the screen resolution fixes the issue, then that's what I should do. I still hope, though, that someone is planning a fix.)

		Expected behaviour I would like to have one option to auto decrypt mails with APG etc and save locally. (Reason: This should let me search locally all emails for some thing as we have every thing available decrypted.) This helps secure email during transport from email providers and I don't bother much about my phone and k9 mail client security. This will be a great convenience and should help many adopt this. Actual behaviour Finding to find an email using a text search thru all encrypted emails is difficult. manually going thru each mail decrypt and see is difficult and inconvenient If I dont bother much about saving unencrypted locally in the sense that K-9 will use a encrypted container for all the mails together but all emails are saved plain text in that container.

But I dont have an option to save it decrypted locally as this is not an email that needs to keep decrypted and only needs to reach me encrypted and now I dont need it encrypted anymore.

		I've thought about this suggestion and whether it will be offensive to post it here rather than to fork, refactor and push it to f-droid myself. A quick online search revealed that I'm not alone with my thoughts. This e-mail client is fine, very fine, I love it. My respect to all contributors. But most likely it will never be accepted as a serious application. The reason is an ugly name and the the whole branding (icons). Do you really think that any serious company which is not a lemonade stand would like to see an ugly robo-dog icon on their main launcher? Most people don't even know what K9 means or stands for. How do you think about to rename the entire package into &quot;e-mail&quot; or &quot;eMail&quot; or something similar without any fancy names additions and a simple envelope icon? 👍 2 👎 1 😕 1

		this is more a feature request than an issue... would it be possible to auto complete new-email's TO/CC/BCC fields based on senders/receivers of already pulled and locally stored emails ? Indeed, I like K9 because it allows me to send/receive emails without requiring to be linked to my device's gmail account, thus saving part of my privacy. Also, my 'contacts' do contain only minimal infos about my friends (in case the device would be robbed and to protect their privacy against Google). In such a context, k9 does not provided any auto completion :(

		Hi! I have built K9 from source and it has been very easy since the source is very clean and well organised, thanks to you! Then I wanted to build libos-compat.so, but its source isn t in K9's, all there is in K9 is an already compiled version. I downloaded SafeContentResolver-0.1.0 and built it, but the resulting file is much bigger than the one you use in K9 (70 kb whereas yours is only 9 sommething kb). The file is built within the SafeContentResolver-v14.aar and that s probably why it s heavier, the README file says that v21 is much lighter. But, impossible to have it to build with v21... Or maybe your file is smaller because you used only part of it for K9, with the ABI options? The thing is that I searched and I searched and I could t find anywhere how to build that lib the K9 way. Would you mind sharing the way you did it? Thanks in advance!

		I always used K9 with my work IMAP account. Yesterday I upgraded my phone to Cyanogenmod 13, and K9 to the newest version. Now I get SSL errors when I try to connect to the server. It seems the same in the build in email app, however the &quot;Outlook&quot; email apps seems to work fine. I can get mail from the server fine with Thunderbird on Windows also. Sending seems to work ok. Other email accounts (for example gmail) work fine using IMAP.

		Expected behavior Tell us what should happen The automatic account settings picks POP instead of IMAP for comcast.net accounts. Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead When creating a new account and letting k9 figure out the account settings, it picks POP even though IMAP is available. It should be picking IMAP since comcast.net supports IMAP. I'm not sure how k9 decides what to use. The best way is to probe a few combination of things to figure out if IMAP is supported and if it is, use IMAP otherwise try POP and fall back to POP if IMAP doesn't work. If it is already probing, it may be the way it probes that isn't working. Comcast uses the full email address as the login name not just the username so the probes might be failing by using the incorrect name. i.e. login names are user@comcast.net It is also possible that the server name for IMAP or SMTP is incorrect. Comcast uses imap.comcast.net and smtp.comcast.net for the server names. manual IMAP configuration works, but k9 should be smart enough to figure out the IMAP settings and use IMAP. Steps to reproduce create a new account for a comcast.net account. Once completed, account will be using POP instead of IMAP.

		Expected behavior It should download new emails as it used to do. Actual behavior It downloads from some of the accounts that are set up, but then puts up a message saying &quot;Unfortunately, K-9 Mail has stopped.&quot; It doesn't do it 100% of the time, but most of it. Then it'll stop crashing for a short while and then start again. Steps to reproduce 1.Pull down emails to make it sync. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version:6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): K-9 is configured with 6 POP3 mail accounts all on the same server. It is my suspicion that I had received a badly crafted email on one of the accounts that gets a lot of SPAM. This started the problem. I would guess that it has now corrupted something in K-9 which is causing the ongoing problems. I have sent a report of the crash several times, including a couple just now, one of which has debugging turned on. Your advice would be most useful - unless it can be sorted fairly quickly, I will have to switch to a different email app which would be a shame after I've used K-9 for several years and recommended it to other people.

		Expected behavior I should be able to see all folders and also use other e-mail clients to access my account. Actual behavior When I use the &quot;Show all folders&quot; action, I am being banned by my e-mail server due to &quot;too many connections&quot;. Steps to reproduce (I am writing this in a generalized way and I am putting specific circumstances in soft brackets. Access/Configure to an IMAP server (Microsoft Server (OWA) at workplace) with K9-Mail. Access/Configure to the same account with Thunderbird. Create some folders under main INBOX in Thunderbird. Change K9 settings to show &quot;All Folders&quot; instead of only 1st or 2nd class folders. Try to access e-mails via Thunderbird again and fail due to &quot;wrong password&quot;. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 5.1.1 CyanogenMod 12.1/LG G3 D855 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP on Exchange Server. Additional Info The Thunderbird error turns out to be insufficient. The error message &quot;wrong password&quot; is not true. Nothing has changed with my password. The problem turns out to be the maximum allowed connections! And the problem always starts with &quot;Show all folders&quot; in K9-Mail. By allowing more connections on the server side resolves the issue temporarily/shortly. I guess, K9-Mail invokes too many connections, presumably one for each folder, without closing these. On a mail server where this number of connections exceeds, other clients cannot access anymore. Same password, which used be working and still is working with K9-Mail and Webmail, stops working for other clients (Thunderbird in this case). But the problem isn't Thunderbird or the password. I think solution would be to tightly limit outgoing IMAP connections by default. I didn't find any option to this in the settings.

		There's a possibility to group messages into message chains and display them as a single entry in a list. When user taps on message chain input messages from selected group are shown. It would be more comfortable if sent messages were displayed too, allowing user to look over the whole conversation. Such behavior is already implemented in TypeApp - another Android mail client. Expected behavior After tap to message chain all emails with selected subject are displayed independent of folder they are placed to. Actual behavior After tap to message chain only inbox emails with selected subject are displayed. Steps to reproduce Go to inbox Tap to any message chain Look for sent emails Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.010 Android version: 5.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): Imap

		Expected behavior Inline PGP should be accepted correctly (or not at all). Actual behavior Inline PGP email is encrypted and signed with the same key-pair. This message will be marked with a red lock saying &quot;signature made by wrong key&quot;. Sending the same message with a current version of K9 and using PGP/MIME and using the same key-pair shows the message green. Steps to reproduce Use only 1 key pair. Send [encrypted and] signed email to self using the current stable version, which uses only inline PGP. Use the same key-pair with v5.114 (alpha). Send a message with the same key pair again. The new version marks the email send via Inline PGP (with the old version) as wrong, while only the one with MIME PGP is marked correctly.

		Went from Nexus 10 (Android 5.1.1 Build LMY49J) to NEXUS 9 (7.0.0 Build NRD91N, Nov 2016)) Both were routed so I used Titanium Backup and moved K-9 Mail v5.010. I have 3 mail acounts 2x IMAP and one WEB-DAV using exchange (with a self signed cert) The IMAP accounts are OK, but the WEBDAV account just reports Java exceptions. Can't fetch new mails, nor can't change something in the mailserver settings. Are there any known incompatibilities with Android 7 and webdav support? Also tried the latest v5.114 (alpha). isn't better at all. Setting up completely new gives the same result. So it's not caused by using Titanium Backup. Besides I know that this config is working on Android 5.1.1 BR Markus

		Expected behavior When an user on Windows encrypts an email with Thunderbird (newest version), Enigmail/GPG and sents it as Inline PGP, K9 Mail recognizes this mail as encrypted and opens the passphrase dialog of OpenKeychain to decrypt the message. Actual behavior K9Mail does not recognize that the mail is encrypted and simply shows the encrypted mail body. Possible reason It seems that additionalcharacters &quot;=20&quot; are added after the &quot;Version&quot; header which do not appear when using other PGP Clients. K9Mail does not seem to be able to ignore or detect this. I am not sure whether this is a protocol violation on the side of Enigmail or K9Mail. This is what the source code of the encrypted mail body look like: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Charset: utf-8
Version: GnuPG v2
=20
hQIMA0naAJOr8cb2AQ/8CwuirQ23bx4b8Hcn6w67qMOtMsxJt9vPtrGE4kzIwYVl

......
 Steps to reproduce User A on Windows/Thunderbird/Enigmail sends encrypted email as inline PGP to User B with K9Mail K9Mail is unable to recognize the inline PGP in the mail body and does not show the decryption dialog Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.115 Android version: 6.0.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behavior If my smartphone is in doze, I should immediately receive notifications about incoming mails via IMAP and push connection with syncing enabled. Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead After some time I see the words &quot;syncing disabled&quot;, although it is &quot;always enabled&quot;. Steps to reproduce use imap with push, syncing enabled close all apps, put phone to doze send yourself an email you don't receive any notifications of incoming mails anymore I found out, that push syncing in doze mode seems to still work on my newest android 7.1 (cm14.1) if you set your auto email-request interval to say 30 minutes. This seems to keep the push connection open which is a good workaround until this gets fixed. Another thing I tried before is excluding k-9 mail from android battery optimizations, but this unfortunately didn't make a difference.

		Expected behavior Deleted items should delete and stay deleted; items saved to Drafts should show up in Drafts; e-mails should open immediately, delete immediately, and return to Inbox immediately. When I first got my Fire tablet, I recommended K9 to my cousin who has a Fire tablet, and she loved it. Today, I mentioned losing the K9 draft, and she said she started having trouble with K9 &quot;a long time ago&quot; and stopped using it. So it isn't just me nor my limited storage Fire. Actual behavior I have to delete items dozens of times to get them to stay deleted; they reappear as read in both the Inbox and the Trash folders. When I save an e-mail in progress to Drafts, it just disappears, and I have to start over. It has started taking longer and longer for K9 to respond to anything I try to do with it, often going to black screen, returning to the Folders menu because it got stuck doing whatever I tried to get it to do, showing only the top half of the accounts screen or Inbox screen, or message screen. Steps to reproduce Do anything on the Fire tablet. Do anything on the Fire tablet. Do anything on the Fire tablet.

		Expected behavior I am trying to access an outlook365 account (I have to because my work decided to outsource their IT infrastructure to the Microsoft Cloud) with K-9 via IMAP. The server settings are as follows: server: outlook.office365.com security: SSL/TLS port: 993 authentication: normal password auto detect IMAP namespace true IMAP path prefix I expect messages that I have marked as read to stay read and messages that I have stared to stay stared and messages whose star I have removed to remain &quot;unstared&quot; Actual behavior Unfortunately, when I do any of the above operations (mark read, star, unstar) then the message is displayed as read, stared, unstared for a while but during one next few hours (or sometimes just minutes), read messages come back as unread, and stars disappear or reappear. I also see the following errors for various sub-folders of the account in question: K9-Mail version: 5.200-RC2

 Here a similar problem was reported and a workaround could be to &quot;limit the number of connections&quot; as is discussed there. Would you at K-9 be willing to work on such a workaround? If not, is there anything else I could try to make outlook365 via IMAP work? Steps to reproduce Set up an outlook365 accoun Mark an unread message as read Wait for it to come back as unread Further background I have also tried to setup the account as an Exchange account together with the people from our IT without success. Sending email via SMTP works without problems.

		Expected behavior There must be an option to deactivate the progress notifications when fetching from an IMAP server. Actual behavior Progress notifications cannot be deactivated. Steps to reproduce Don't use push Update all IMAP folders every 20 minutes Get notifications every 20 minutes Environment K-9 Mail version: Latest trunk Android version: all Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP Extended reason / Explanation I'm syncing my Phone notification to a watch. There are only 2 ways to filter the notifications to the watch. 1. In Android: Notification can be blocked per app. 2. In the watch-app that syncs the notifications to the watch. Also here I can only filter by application, but not by notification type. So there must be a way to disable specific notification types in K9 (like &quot;fetching new emails&quot;). Obviously, the notifications ABOUT NEW EMAILS of K9 are very important to be sent to the watch, so they should not be blocked. When using IMAP PUSH it is all good. But push has only limited support with some IMAP servers. So sometimes it is necessary to set the timer, to fetch IMAP messages every 20 minutes. Problem : That causes the smart watch to ring and vibrate every 20 minutes several times (for each IMAP folder) with a new notification (&quot;updating folder XXX&quot;).

		Expected behavior When you create, forward or reply to a message the recipient's name or email address should show. If there are more than one recipient their names or email addresses should show too, separated by commas. Actual behavior When you create, forward or reply to a message the recipient's photo shows next to their name or email address. If they do not have a picture in your contacts list or are not in your contacts list a large initial (the first initial of their email address or name) appears next to their email address or name. This takes up a huge amount of space, especially when you have a drop down list. There is no option in the settings to turn this behavior off and just show plain text, comma separated with no pictures/initial and no dropdown list. Steps to reproduce Go to an email account. Create a new message. Start typing in a name or email address in the To: field. When you are finished with that recipient you will see their picture or a giant initial.

		Expected behavior Compose new message. Select a recipient whose public PGP key I have. Enter message subject and body. Tap the lock symbol right to the sender (i.e. my) name. Change setting from &quot;Encrypt if possible&quot; to &quot;Encrypt&quot;. Continue. Send message. Message is sent. Actual behavior Message CANNOT be sent. Popup shows the following text (translated from German): &quot;No signing key is configured. Verify settings.&quot; Steps to reproduce I use a PGP environment with separate subkeys for signing and encryption. On mobile devices, I only have the encryption subkey, but not the signing subkey and also not the master key. Hence, I can decrypt only, but not sign. That's exactly what I want. If your interested in the full rationale, German computer magazine c't has an in depth article about it in issue 27/2015. It seems that starting with k-9 5.200, I can only sign and encrypt, but not encrypt only. This seems like a regression from 5.010 and earlier. In those versions, there were two separate checkboxes &quot;Sign&quot; and &quot;Encrypt&quot; in the compose new message dialog, so the &quot;encrypt only&quot; use case worked perfectly.

		After the update to 5.2 many people have connection problems, most likely because their mailservers only support weak ciphers that are no longer supported. Some others report problems with Google which can't be weak ciphers. I would appreciate a note that states clearly why the connection fails and maybe even encourages the user to go to the mailserver provider and fix the problem at the rooot.

		Expected behaviour When tapping on a message in the list, the message will take full screen and there are icons at the bottom of the screen for left, right, delete, reply, new, and menu. Actual behaviour These icons are not consistently displayed. When they are not displayed, it is still possible to tap the empty space where they should be and the icon function will happen (for example, tap where the delete icon should be and the message will be deleted). Sometimes only the right-most fragment of the icon bar is displayed. I tried to get a screen-shot of this, but as soon as the screen-shot was triggered, the entire icon bar displayed correctly just in time. So it seems that Android's screen-shot function triggers a redraw first, and screenshots cannot therefore be used to capture examples of insufficient-redraw artefacts. Steps to reproduce Send yourself a blank message, or one with very little content Refresh the message list so your new message appears Open the message Sometimes the icons are displayed OK anyway. This is an intermittent problem. You may have to send yourself 4 or 5 messages and open each one to reproduce the issue.

		Running K9 5.203 from Google Play. Google Pixel with Android 7.1.1. I Have three accounts on K9, all are accounts on gmail but with non @gmail.com domains. Call them: trevor@a.com (personal, gmail with custom domain) trevor@b.com (corporate with google apps) trevor@c.com (another business, not used in this example) Bug #1: Open trevor@a.com on K9. Send email to self (trevor@a.com). Email never appears as &quot;new&quot; mail in either K9 or gmail web UI. Appears in &quot;sent mail&quot; only. This used to work on versions of K9 up until recently, suspect broken around 5.2? Bug #2: Open trevor@a.com on K9. Send email to self but different account (trevor@b.com). This email appears as &quot;new&quot; mail IN BOTH ACCOUNTS. It shows as Sent Mail in trevor@a.com but new mail in Inbox of both trevor@a.com and trevor@b.com.

		On the TO, CC, and BCC entry lines, one expects recipients addresses to be editable. Also, one expects recipients addresses to be copy-cut-and-pasteable between the TO, CC, and BCC entry lines. This is broken in recent versions. Eg.: Enter abd@m.n into any of TO CC or BCC Now, try to 'correct' abd@m.n into abcd@m.n This does not work (anymore). It used to work in earlier versions. Reply to all of an email, formerly addressed to you, and at least also to ab@c.de Now, try to cut ab@c.de from the TO recipients entry line and paste it into the BCC (or CC) entry line. This does not work (anymore). Instead the copy action produces a lower quote character. It used to work in earlier versions. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: several Account type: IMAP Currently, with this loss of edibility of addresses, recipients management is awkwardly complicated. PLS reintroduce editable recipients addresses. Thank you! xaverm

		At random times, to which I can't figure out when, K-9 Mail will show Syncing Disabled under my Inbox and notifications will not show up. Expected behavior Notifications should arrive when mail arrives. Inbox should not be showing &quot;syncing disabled&quot; Actual behavior Under the inbox you will see 'syncing disabled&quot; and during this time no notifications will show up. A pull to refresh in the window will grab new email but it goes back to syncing disabled. All regular settings to allow syncing and intervals are set up correctly where this should be working. Steps to reproduce Possibly not using the app for hours. Do not know the cause. Notice on another device (desktop client) that new mail arrived. Check K-9 Mail (the inbox) and see syncing is disabled Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: 7.0 (Nexus 6) Account type: IMAP

		Hello, The size of my account mailboxes is not decreasing when I delete messages. I have tried clearing local messages and compacting account but the size of the mailbox does not decrease, they keep getting larger. Removing and re-adding email accounts does not make a difference. Before recent K-9 Mail updates, clearing local messages in each folder after deleting messages and emptying trash would reduce the size of the account mailbox to around 100KB or less. There is a thread in the general purpose mailing list that began in early January. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/k-9-mail/OEpBHFCtxBo Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.203 Android version: 5.0.2 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): POP 3 and IMAP Your help will be appreciated.

Actual behavior the mail preview has not the same characters as i see them in the e-mail itself. all questionmarks from the e-mail content are shown in the preview a crossed rectangle. Ã�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â¤ Steps to reproduce i tried i manually, but it seams that it might be a github specific problem. so. i just hope that it is reproducable for me, after posting this issue here on github. i just have signed to all notifications in k-9. i let you know if it is the same. so i posted the line with the wrong encoded output directly at the beginning.

		Occasionally (without obvious reason or method to reproduce), tapping on DELETE and deleting messages from the notification area results in the message being deleted but the notification does not refresh or remove from the notification area (leaving it in place and still responsive to processing by further tapping). The only way to remove it from notification is to swipe it away to clear it. This happens frequently but not always. (Ive noticed a frequency with Facebook notifications but I would think thats coincidence rather than cause). This behaviour did not occur prior to 5.202. Expected behavior Tap DELETE within notifications, confirm delete (and have the message removed within the app), and the notification is updated accordingly (the messages no longer appear in the notification area). Actual behavior The notification remains and doesnt refresh to reflect the deletion thats been applied. Steps to reproduce This screenshot shows the initial notification of 2x new messages (although in reality there are 5 - but thats another problem and already logged). This screen shots shows me actually clicking and confirming DELETE of the 2 messages from the notification 'delete' button: This next shot shows that in the notifications there are the same messages still there (note the time of 7:59 is after I performed the delete for them - they have not been removed from notification area): If I tap on the notification to view the messages you see that they are not actually there resulting in : And the summary list view of the Inbox indeed shows that they are no longer there (but show the other 3 that should have also been included in the notification - again this relates to the other problem already logged).

		When tapping items in Unified Inbox list, an aleatory item is selected (probably mixed item indexing issue). This works correctly in individual accound inbox list. And worked correctly in the previous releases. Expected behavior In &quot;Unified Inbox&quot; list, when you tap in a list item/message, the item should be selected and message opened. When tap in the checkbox, the related item should be &quot;checked&quot;. Actual behavior When tapping a list item, it is selecting an aleatory item, not the tapped one. Sometimes selects the previous or the next item of the tapped one. Steps to reproduce Open the &quot;Unified Inbox&quot; list (that aggregates more than one account, with mixed message dates).

		In most of our screens, the k9 icon in the top left is a &quot;back&quot; button. This is not the case in the Compose dialog, but it would be nice if it was :) The particular action depends on the back stack: If the action was called from the message list, just return there. Otherwise, open up the K9 start screen. This can happen e.g. if the compose dialog is opened from some other app. (@cketti sanity check please, I'm not entirely sure this is in line with android behavior guidelines? if it is, this can be a beginner issue)

		Hi I use email sharing (passing content to othr apps) with other apps alot but one issue I have is that it shares the whole body of email and if the whole body is a long email then it is a mess given that it also shares the html code. For instance I share an email to my tasks apps to keep track of it and in most cases the title and the date of email etc is enough information for such tasks. And given that most apps wont be able to render html inside the whole email body looks like a mess in the apps. My feature request is for having one more share item where it says &quot;share basic&quot; and the other would be &quot;share all/advanced&quot; this way the user can decide what kind of email content he wants to share with other apps. Or the other solution would be some kind of settings that dictaces how much info should be passed to the other apps. One solution would be to not to send any html and makse sure only rendered text passed along, if none of the ideas above is implementable. thanks

The back button unexpected behavior happens only when tapping it first before going to Accounts activity. Detailed steps to reproduce this are given below. Expected behavior On tapping back button for first time also it should navigate to the Accounts activity. Actual behavior On tapping back button of your smartphone before using the on screen button provided in the application, it will close the application. Steps to reproduce Launch the application and goto folders page. Tap the back button of your smartphone and it will close the application. Now relaunch the application and again follow the step-1 and this time instead press the back button provided on the top-left corner of the screen(Left side of Folders) to goto Accounts activity. Now click on the account and get back to Inbox activity. Now again follow step 1-2. This time on tapping the back button of your smartphone you will be redirected to the Accounts activity instead of closing the application. Now you can tap back button or click on provided button any number of times from Folders activity, it won't kill the application. Now close the application and relaunch again and tapping back button will close the application again. But if you follow steps 1-3-4 first then this won't happen.

I checked flag not to delete local message deleted on server. I create new folder called BACKUP. And tried to copy(move tried too) message from Inbox to BACKUP folder, but K9-Mail doesn't upload it to server as I expected it. I'm very want to restore all this messages on server. Thanks. p.s. I had some idea to write X_REMOTE_COPY_STARTED flag to ALL messages in my .db and restart K9-Mail (I have root on my phone), but I see that 4 messages in my DB already has this flag but they weren't uploaded to server.

I use to redirect (move) messages to different folders based on the subject, the sender, the mailing list, etc. In GNOME Evolution actions like deleting, flagging, tagging should be performed to.

		Hello, If I have K9mail check for new messages every 60 mins, it comes back every 60 mins saying 100 unread messages. I would have thought the expected/desired behaviour is to say 1 new message (since last sync) or don't notify if 0 new messages since last sync. Is this an option that I'm not seeing in K9 or is it not a feature?

		Are they going to fix this issue that I see many others are having? K9 was just updated today and I hoped the fix was in, but no, left the phone alone for about an hour and upon waking up k9 said next sync 2 hours AGO, tried a little later and the old syncing disabled was back. I have tried everything, from whitelisting K9 from power savings to completely turning off that feature, no luck. I have tried MacroDroid to do things such as keep awake, turn wifi on and off, terminate the k9 process and after a delay open k9, and others all on a repeating 30 minute schedule, it still goes to sleep and k9 says syncing disabled, close and reopen k9 and it works fine. This started with Android 6.01 and got much much worse in 7.0 Thanks

		Keeping in view of the interests of the end-users,it would be great to work upon simple tools that would enhance email experience. Like inclusion of a link scanner to scan for potentially harmful links. Another tool will be scanning for malware within archives using signature matching.A string search algorithm may be used to match keywords in mails for unwanted mails (and ask for a permission) before they are opened by end-user. These are simple tools but will be of great help for a better client experience. We may take help from open source antivirus engines such as Clamav to accomplish our task. Expected behaviour Decrease in online frauds. Decrease in mail bombing like activities and associated attacks by hackers. Better user experience.

			<description>
		Hi, I think k9 is failing to reject expired (self-signed) SSL certificates, and/or the warnings have not been clear enough. I noticed this when I installed claws-mail on my laptop: At first I didn't believe what I was seeing, as mbsync (an IMAP synchroniser I am using) was not complaining, but then I went to the server: $ openssl x509 -text -in dovecotcert.pem -noout
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: XXX
    Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=XXX, ST=XXX, L=XXX, O=XXX, OU=IMAP server, CN=XXX/emailAddress=XXX
        Validity
            Not Before: Dec 27 00:42:30 2014 GMT
            Not After : Dec 26 00:42:30 2016 GMT
...
 It has indeed expired! (so we have a side issue for mbsync here too, I'll be raising a bug) I don't recall ever seeing K9 warn me that the certificate has expired. I've just deleted the account from K9 and re-added it. This is what I see: There's a subtle issue here. I expect to see a warning about the certificate being invalid due to it being self signed. People self sign all the time, and it's generally OK as long as you check the fingerprint matches. However, if the certificate is expired, that's another arguably more severe matter. I wonder if K9 should make a distinction. A question I can't yet answer is: what happens if the user initially sets up an IMAP account, accepts a self-signed but current (unexpired) SSL cert, then later the cert expires. This must have happened to me at some point, yet I don't recall K9 warning me (that's not to say it didn't but perhaps it wasn't explicit enough)? Does it just accept a cert forever more? Expected behavior When making an account: Explicitly warn the user if the signer is invalid. Give a separate explicit error message if the certificate has expired. If the user dismisses the warning that the cert is expired, warn again later (say once a day)? Maybe too extreme? After setting up an account: Warn explicitly when a previously accepted certificate expires (sorry if it turns out K9 does do this, but I missed the warning. Arguably, if I missed it, it wasn't clear enough) Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.206 Android version:66.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP The server side is dovecot. Thanks

		So I use K9 Mail because it is seamless for my Squirrlmail corporate email and my personal GMAIL. I had issues beginning last night as I got a message that my Authentication failed. I could not log back in, and deleted/reinstalled the app this morning. It still took several hours to connect, even though my laptop (windows 10 utilizing Outlook 2010 as the client) had no issues. After FINALLY getting my phone to connect, it once again stopped connecting and I get this upon a sync &quot;ErrnoException: open failed. I use the app a lot because I am on the go quite often, and I am thinking I may have to go to another app for my Corporate email?

		Currently when I'm offline (ie. in flight mode) and write an email, there is an non-userfriendly message (&quot;Failed to send some Message&quot; following GaiException: android_getaddrinfo failed…). Additionally the mobile LED will blink nervously in read. As there are various good reasons to be offline (often explicitely known anyway by the user) it would be more useful to show a note like &quot;Hey, I can't reach the server at the moment but it will be send when you are online again.&quot;. I mean, beaing offline isn't an error. That's one reason the outbox is for. And k9 mail is a native client that could handle it gracefully anyway. PS: I love the recent design changes 👍

Create two email accounts Create two PGP keys, one for each Choose the appropriate key for each account It's far too easy to misclick and choose the wrong key, and there is no way to check which key was chosen. This is simultaneously: a technical issue(the email will be signed by the wrong key), a privacy issue(allows the recipient to connect purposefully isolated identities and get to know more email addresses of the sender), a UX issue(you only get the information on which key was chosen when encrypting the email, and if you chose wrong, it is very confusing). A patch would include querying Open Keychain to reveal the identity connected with the chosen key(unless K9 already stores that information) and putting the result of this query into &quot;My key&quot;. If doesn't have to be 100% of the identity, just enough to make different identities distinct, as in &quot;last 4 digits of the credit card&quot; Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.206 Android version: Used: 5.1.1, but probably all are affected.

		Maybe you have heard of a messenger called Detla Chat. It does chat over the e-mail infrastructure. I.e. it's like a mail client, but in the form of a messenger application. Lots of people already use it, and it will probably become more and more popular once more features are implemented (like encryption). Now the problem is the following: Detla Chat gives me a notification if I received a message form specific senders (white list). This is the desired behavior. However, at the same time I also get a notification from k-9 mail. My request is to add an option to blacklist specific senders so that we don't get a new mail notification for them. That's it. Would be really cool if you could implement this.

		Hi, I would really appreciate a button to delete the message in the notifications. There already is 'mark es read' and 'answer', but the most common use cases are: Answer later from PC (which is fine by swyping the notification) delete the message (eg spam or irrelevant) archive (mark as read and move to specific folder) for emergencies or short messages: answer (now). Maybe it would fit best to make it configurable which actions are shown? Would love it!! Thanks so much for all the good work anyway!

		[Running Android 7.0 on a stock unrooted Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (SM-G935F) with K-9 Mail Version 5.206] I've been using this app for a couple of years without any issues to run a total of 7 email accounts (six G Suite, one gmail and one Outlook, one hotmail, all IMAP). In the past couple of days my primary G Suite account has been failing with the notification &quot;Authentication failed for xxx@xxx.xxx. Update your server settings&quot;. When I click on the notification I go through the K-9 password and server settings reconfirmation but the problem recurs after a few minutes. However, some email does appear to be getting through, so this is an intermittent error. I've checked and reset the email account password in G Suite and confirmed that I can collect emails via www.gmail.com and on other Android/Windows platforms. The password is correct and the account settings mirror exactly those in the other G Suite accounts, which are behaving correctly. I've also removed the account, rebooted the phone and re-added the account and received the same error. I've also Gone into www.gmail.com and signed out of all other web sessions. The G Suite settings are enabled for less secure apps. Oh, and I ran teh Recreate Data option in K-9.

		Expected behavior When a user receives an email from K9, they shouldn't see the list of bcc recipients Actual behavior The list of bcc recipients is actually visible Steps to reproduce IMPORTANT: The reproducibility of this bug depends on which email provider you're using. I reproduced it when using K9 with an icloud.com email sending a message to yahoo.com recipients. Add an icloud.com account to K9 Send a message to yahoo.com recipients (one TO recipient, a CC recipient and a couple of BCC recipients) When checking the message in the TO recipient mailbox, the list of BCC recipients is visible Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.109 Android version: 7.1 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP I think this happens because SmtpTransport.sendMessage receives a LocalMessage as a parameter. When the method set the BCC recipients to null, the actual BCC header is not removed because the setRecipients method of LocalMessage doesn't update the headers (as opposed to MimeMessage)

		In K9 mail, folders can be assigned the following classes: &quot;None&quot; (the default), &quot;1st&quot; and &quot;2nd&quot;. It is then possible to configure whether something (e.g. polling) applies to &quot;All&quot; &quot;Only 1st Class folders&quot; &quot;1st and 2nd Class folders&quot; &quot;All except 2nd CLass folders&quot; &quot;None&quot; Here, the last choice means not to poll any folders. This nomenclature is more confusing than necessary, since &quot;None&quot; has two meaning: &quot;no folders&quot; and &quot;no class assigned&quot;. A user could easily think that choosing &quot;None&quot; for polling means to poll the folders whose class is &quot;None&quot;. This problem could be resolved easily by renaming the &quot;None&quot; class to the &quot;Default&quot; class. This would be only an UI text modification that does not change at all how the application behaves.

		It would be useful if the &quot;Failed to send some messages&quot; notification had a &quot;try again&quot; button. In virtually all cases the cause for this notification to appear is a flaky internet connection. It is the quite cumbersome to first tap the notification, which takes one to the account screen, then choose &quot;send messages&quot; from the overflow menu. Alternatively one could think of a option to make k9 try at least a given number of times with some delay to send messages and only then show the notification.

		I've been using MailListWidget for K-9 on my S3 for years, but it won't work on newer devices. The other widget (Email Widget) listed on the web site does only work to a certain degree. I'm not an Android/Java developer so I can't write this myself, but a Maillist Widget should be fairly easy to develop. Why not make it part of K-9? MailListWidget for K-9 was slick and tremendously useful. I hoped something similar could be part of K-9.

		I use a mail service that encrypts incoming plaintext mail with my public key.

		Hi, When reading a mail, it happens (accidentally or not) that the phone is rotated. Ideally, the current reading position within the text should not change when changing from portrait to landscape mode or vice versa. For example, when while reading the 10th paragraph the phone is rotated, this paragraph should still be displayed after the rotation. Unfortunately, K9 mail jumps all the way back to the top when the screen is rotated (and the display mode is changed from portrait to landscape or vice versa). This behaviour is rather annoying because one needs to scroll down again to continue reading. Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.208

		I would like to request a feature to cleanly interrupt all syncing so that it then can be started cleanly again. I am using manual synchronization a lot and it often happens that sync gets stuck when the internet connection gets interrupted - for example in a train. Restarting sync at the moment has a lot of strange side effects like endlessly spinning or multiple sync notifications. &quot;Killing&quot; K9 through the list all running apps menu does not always solve these problems.

			<description>
		Previously, when multiple new emails arrived for a single account, those emails were grouped in to a single notification (1x swipe down) which on a single press could be all deleted (ie, DELETE ALL). Now, a group requires expanding (the 2nd swipe down), and when the group is expanded, each email is shown individually and each one then needs expanding (the 3rd swipe down) to get the DELETE button. However, after doing a delete of an individual email and confirming YES to delete, the notifications need to be opened again (with 3x swipe downs) to then delete the next email in the list. Imagine doing this if you have multiple emails - it takes ages! 8 emails = 24 swipe downs. (This is very possible for accounts that have, for example, forum or mailing list notifications, or emails that come in over night.) This was not the behaviour in a previous version. Emails were grouped and offered a single 'Delete all' button. I do not know if it is the version of K9 or the version of android that makes it behave differently (previously I was running the latest version of K9 on android 4.2.1). I am now running on android 7.0 (Samsung). Of course it is easier to instead tap the notification and do rapid select and delete from within the account inbox but this is a backward step given we once had the option to delete from notification. Expected behavior All new mail notifications for a single account should appear grouped in one header. That header, once expanded to show the subset of individual mails (to a certain limit - previously it was 6) should have the option to DELETE ALL to then effect a delete of all the emails in that account group. It could also enable further swipe down to expand individual emails and offer individual delete oif required. Actual behavior 3 swipe downs for each email with ability to only delete one at a time. (Process explained above) Steps to reproduce Send in 5 emails to the sam address Receive notifications Get swiping!

		Hello, I face an issue while synchronizing my Sent mails box ; the sent mails do not synchronize. The mails I send from the phone appear, but the mail I send from other devices (PC...) does not appear on the phone, even after synchronizing. I have set up the Sent mails folder as class 1 folder but this does not change the behaviour. Does anyone have an idea to solve the problem ? I expect it is not a configuration problem but I have tried many settings without success and I have no ideas anymore... Thank you for help ! Expected behavior When asking for synchronizing the Sent mails, the new mails stored on the server should appear in K-9 mail on the phone. Actual behavior No mail is synchronized.

		I've got the opposte problem of all other folks: It seems to be impossible to DISABLE syncing. This happens on my new Honor 9 with Android 7 - didnt have these issues on my One Plus X both with Android 5 nor 6. Expected behavior I disabled syncing - as far as I know - in all places, starting from the account, globally and even folder-wise. I'm using k9 as a secondary client, which only becomes important as primary one when I'm elsewhere AND still expecting work mails. I prefer control, ie. manual fetching, over auto-sync and having my smartphone screen clustered with mail notifications (notifications behaviour under Android 7 seems generally to be awkwardly off aka exploding; a total PITA to me) My guess is its a Doze-related issue, but then there must have been an extreme change between Android 6 and 7, because on 6 everything worked as expected (as noted above). Actual behavior When you &quot;turn on&quot; your phone (actually just turn on the screen), you are most of the time being greeted by new mail notifications. So the disabled sync seems to be ignored. Steps to reproduce Set up a nifty IMAP account on a regular host, including encryption etc. Install k9 Disable synchronization EVERYWHERE, including singular IMAP folders.

The font size shrinks extremely small, I guess to avoid a scrollbar? Pic. To be fair, this looks almost as bad in Thunderbird; I guess many replies is outside of most use cases. I would like for this to be nicer, though, especially since there's so little screen space on android. Steps to reproduce Write an email with many replies (I believe this one had about 20-30) Open in K9 Environment K-9 Mail version: 5.208 Android version: 7.0 Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): IMAP

		Expected behavior When connecting to an IMAP account, K9 should look for existing standard folders for Trash, Sent, Drafts, Junk on the server and respect those even if called differently. It should not create new standard folders on the server just because they do not exist under the (localized) name. If K9 cannot identify those existing folders, the user should be asked which action to take. Actual behavior When creating a new IMAP account in a localized K9 (e.g. German), it will look for standard folders on the server using localized names (e.g. Papierkorb for the trash bin). If folders with those names do not exists, they are silently created, even if there already is a folder for that purpose but with a different name. E.g. there may be a folder called Trash, but anyway K9 creates another one called Papierkorb. This ends up with K9 moving deleted mails to &quot;Papierkorb&quot;, while any other application using the same IMAP account would move them to &quot;Trash&quot;. The same bug has been reported in issue #881 which has been closed, but should not. It is an old bug and still exists.

		This is a feature request. I'd like to be able to use the Refile/Move menu to move a message to a folder in another email account than the message is currently. Right now, the Move menu only shows folders from the email's current account. Would it be possible to add a General Setting to show all accounts' folders in the Move folder list, with some indication of each folder's account, perhaps the account's color code, to distinguish folders with the same names on different accounts? Then to add code to support a move of messages in that way? Thanks. PS: If this is somehow already possible, I'm sorry that I failed to see how in both looking through the settings and in reading the docs!

		I think that the logic for this has been reversed in the latest update. If I check the option to enable a quiet time and have the start set to 0700 and end to 2300 I don't get any notification sounds :-/ I only noticed it recently because I stopped getting notification sounds so it's not any option I've tweaked. I suspect the second of two recent updates.

		Dear team, when I take a look in the play store the current version is 5.402, in the F-Droid store the current version is 5.208. What's the reason for this gap? Is there a bug in the build process? Please fix this. Kind Regards, Krawei

		Since the december update, the red colour on the k-9 icon has changed to a scary, &quot;evil&quot; colour. First i thought it had to do with x-mas, but after a new update since then, the colour is still awful. This occurs on android 4.4.4 K-9 5.402 👍 1

		Expected behavior Tell us what should happen Upon first account setup and syncing. K9 should sync(poll) with yahoo's &quot;Drafts(Drafts)&quot; folder. Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead At first account sync up K9 does not poll the yahoo created &quot;Drafts(Drafts)&quot; folder. Everything else is fine Under the folder name Drafts(Drafts) it says [Command: Examine &quot;Drafts&quot;;] Then k9 creates a new folder named &quot;Draft&quot; on its own. That folder is then created on yahoo's server. Then that error below the Drafts(Drafts) folders name disappears but the original Drafts(Drafts) folder still will not poll. In a nut shell: At the first sync with a YahooMail! account K9 will see the &quot;DraftS&quot; folder but not what's inside of it. K9 gives essential a error of [Command: Examine &quot;Drafts&quot;] Steps to reproduce 1.Make sure a draft already exists in the YahooMail original Draft folder on yahoo mails website. 2. Setup YahooMail with k9 3.view the error [Command: Examine &quot;Drafts&quot;] below the Drafts(Drafts)folder and folder does not sync. 3.

		For the past few months, K9 Mail no longer allows me to read unread mail in order. I order my mail with newest at the top. When I have new mail, I scroll down to the first unread messages and click. When I delete this message, K9 Mail previously showed me the next unread messages. Now it seems to sort the read email together which causes the 'next message' to be mail I have already read, requiring me to hit delete, next, next, next,... to get to the next unread email. It is no longer practical to read new email with K9 Mail when sorting messages to show newest first.

		Maybe it's a little bit too much to ask but It could be cool to have an option in the settings to change the default CSS style used when HTML messages are enabled defined in: k9mail/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/message/html/HtmlConverter.java It could enable us solve #1166 as well.
