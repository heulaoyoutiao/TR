		Now that I know how to do this correctly, it's got to be done. Right now, if the screen is flipped during a network operation in a background thread, two background threads get spawned, and the network operation is done twice. Fortunately for this app, our network threads are all non-destructive GETs, but it's still wrong. In addition, it means the post-execute handler of a thread gets called twice, and in the case of loading a legislator, this means that startActivity() gets called twice on LegislatorTabs, meaning that the user has to hit back twice (through a clone of the activity) to get out -- and if the user has window loading animations enabled, they'll visually see the LegislatorTabs activity zoom in (or whatever) twice.

			<description>
		When the app is loaded, be it List, Profile, or Main Menu, have it check for the CSV, and download it. Make a SunlightDownloader activity that does this. The downloader will download the file to a temporary filename, load the info into the database, and then rename the file to a steady filename. This steady filename will be what gets checked for age, and its presence can be used to verify that the DB is fully loaded. If the file is there and less than 30 days old, don't call out to the SunlightDownloader activity. This check needs to be present in all possible entry points to the app (CreateShortcut, LegislatorLoader, MainMenu). If the file is there, but 30 or more days older, the CSV will be downloaded. Failure to download means the app goes on. If the file isn't there, the CSV must be downloaded. Failure to download means the app shuts down. Effects on the app: State and last name should look in the database. Profile loading should use the database. Remove any now-needless offline checks, like the automatic shutdown from LegislatorLoader. Shutdown checks will happen if the SunlightDownloader fails when it must not fail. Everything else should work exactly the same - the point here is for this feature to look invisible.

Store them as a public static member variable on Legislator, Bill, and Roll, so that methods can be called using &quot;Legislator.service.allWhere(...)&quot;, &quot;Bill.service.find(...)&quot;, etc. The Congress____Service classes should be in their own package, and this is also where the Drumbone and Sunlight classes can go.

		Allow the user to &quot;star&quot; legislators and bills by putting an empty star in the top left of the title bar, where the app icon is now. By tapping it, this legislator or bill will show up at the top of the main menu for quick access, and in the case of legislators, it will show those legislators at the top of the roll call list on RollInfo. Store enough information for each row in the database that we can use the direct-load approach to getting to the LegislatorTabs or BillTabs activities (see Utils for what information is required). This will mean two SQLite tables, one for starred bills, and one for starred legislators. For now, let's call them just &quot;legislators&quot; and &quot;bills&quot;, instead of &quot;starred_legislators&quot;, as we may add more flags and information later on (specifically, for the option of notifications per-bill and per-legislator).

It should follow the same design and code patterns as other ListActivities in the app, such as LegislatorNews.

		In between &quot;New Laws&quot; and &quot;Just Introduced&quot;, add a &quot;Latest Votes&quot; item, that links to the BillList activity. The BillList should populate itself from Drumbone by asking for bills sorted on last_vote_at, in descending order, and filter 'session' on the current session of Congress. Don't worry about filtering on any other flags, it's okay to depend on last_vote_at to filter out bills with no votes, as long as it's in descending order (which is the default). Each list item should look like it does for New Laws and Just Introduced, except the introductory line should say whether the bill passed or failed, and in which chamber. For example: &quot;S. 5176 passed the Senate:&quot; &quot;H. Res. 675 failed in the House:&quot; Passage or failure should be dictated by the contents of the &quot;result&quot; field of the most recent vote in the &quot;votes&quot; section. You should be able to follow the example of how the other two calls to Drumbone work, but for reference, the documentation for Drumbone is here: http://services.sunlightlabs.com/docs/Drumbone_API/

		This could be inline, or as a tab, I don't know yet. But we need to show passage votes on a bill, as well as a way to see all procedural votes on a bill, with a link to a roll call screen for all of them where applicable. Obviously, some passage votes are going to be voice votes, and we have to indicate that clearly.

		Not just roll calls tied to bill passage votes. This falls into two categories: Votes related to bills, that aren't passage votes. Everything else. Speaker elections, nominations, treaties, whatever. For #1, you have to show the bill on a roll call vote and link to it, but expect that the question and result aren't tied to passage. Maybe this doesn't mean much to the UI, but think about it. For #2, you have to support the one-time-only case where the vote types aren't aye/nay/NV/present. I'd prefer to anticipate this in Roll and do most of the hard logic there, and to have RollInfo easily see when alternate vote types are present and display them appropriately.

			<description>
		If a roll call is associated with a particular bill, we want to show a couple of basic details about the bill (the code, the title) in a tappable list item, similar to how we show the sponsor of a bill on the bill detail page. This information is available in the &quot;bill&quot; section of a roll call, in Drumbone. You can also tell from the &quot;bill_id&quot; field in the &quot;basic&quot; section whether that section will be present. The bill section has enough data that I'd prefer not to fetch it if we don't have to. However, we don't want to load the bill data asynchronously, it should be fetched along with the basic information of a bill. So, I think we should send in a flag in the Intent for RollInfo that says whether or not the &quot;bill&quot; section should be fetched, since we're always going to be getting to the RollInfo screen from a place that knows whether a bill is attached or not. Even if we create a RollList activity in the future, we'll have the bill_id at that time and will know whether to send in that flag to RollInfo.

One approach: When the actions are first loaded from the network, iterate through them once and store the indexes of the first view for which you see a new date. As the adapter for displaying the dates loads views, have it hide the data for any action item whose index wasn't kept. Style the date and action items differently to take advantage of how this looks.

When tapped, this will open a new &quot;CommitteeTabs&quot; activity with three tabs, one for &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Senate&quot;, and &quot;Joint&quot;. Each tab will list the committees for that chamber. Each tab can be an instance of a new &quot;CommitteeList&quot; activity, that takes a different &quot;chamber&quot; parameter. Each instance of CommitteeList will be backed by one network call to the Sunlight Congress API. Each committee, when tapped, will direct to the existing LegislatorList form for a committee search. Expand CommitteeService to have a new method that gets all committees. You can use this page for documentation of the Sunlight Congress API endpoint that supplies this: http://services.sunlightlabs.com/docs/congressapi/committees.getList/ Try to follow the code patterns set in existing tab activities and network backed lists.

Email for every official! who voted for what and when link on bill to other bills sponsored by official Share option (BT, email, maybe a bump extension?) Link to PDF of full text Voting histories with links to bills Public contributions accepted and related legislation (based on text search of contributors) There is so much to do with this app... it could be one of the most influential tools come November... it could change the direction of the entire country. Of course you'd have to dummy proof it (hide most of it in advanced settings) and make a big red button that says CURRENTLY UNDER VOTE for things like health care and unemployment, medicare, social security etc... It would be THE goto place for all the armchair non-voters and get them off their asses to vote. I kid you not. P.S. trust me on this one... put out a 'donations' button on your next update and you'll see what i'm talking about!

Notifications for a particular bill or legislator should be enable-able/disable-able from a footer on the bottom of LegislatorTabs, that will be visible from all tabs. There should be a preferences activity that lets the user enable/disable notifications, and also set their interval. This interval should apply to all notifications. Notification subscriptions should be stored in a separate table from favorites, so that we can keep them decoupled.

		The votes tab for a bill should have the ability to show all votes, including procedural votes (such as cloture votes). This won't include procedural voice votes, but it should still be there. On the Votes tab, have two radio buttons beneath the title bar, On Passage and All, and have it default to On Passage. On Passage will, for now, use the passage_votes object on Bill. Later, it can use the votes endpoint that we'll augment with a type of &quot;passage&quot;, &quot;cloture&quot;, or &quot;other&quot; (at least). All will load up all the votes with a separate call to the votes endpoint, using the bill_id.

		Currently, the method LegislatorTabs.correctExceptions, singles out Nancy Pelosi and Eleanor Holmes Norton for special treatment: if (name.equals(&quot;Rep. Nancy Pelosi&quot;))

else if (name.equals(&quot;Del. Eleanor Norton&quot;))
  return &quot;Eleanor Holmes Norton&quot;;

 apparently because they are the Speaker of the House, and the delegate from Washington D.C., respectively? While I don't wish to debate here whether these women are worthy of being distinguished in this way, it seems to me that it would be better to do this programmatically somehow, so that when someone else becomes the Speaker, we don't have to manually change the code.

The first time the user visits the notification settings screen (whether from this route or from the main menu), a dialog appears explaining notifications, with just an OK button. When the dialog is cleared, the preferences are then visible for enabling. There should be an internal preference flag for tracking whether or not the user has visited the Notification Settings page, and used to determine the footer text and show the dialog.

		Two reasons: If a user goes and visits a list they're subscribed to on their own, and sees the latest stuff, there's no reason to notify them of new things. If we update the lastSeenId when we notify, there's no way to accumulate unread items. Thus, if there's one new item, and the user doesn't tap it, then there's another new item, this will overwrite the existing notification and say &quot;1 new item&quot; when in fact there are two. A complication: we do not want the notification to keep going off if the number of unread items doesn't change, even if the user hasn't visited the screen with the new items yet. So we would have to keep track that we have notified the user of a particular number (probably in a separate, smaller SQL table), and then only re-notify the user if the number changes/increases. Makes it more tempting to simply remove the number from the notifications altogether!

		We mention specifically the &quot;network&quot; and &quot;gps&quot; providers in a few places. When finding the lastKnownLocation, we use the network and GPS provider constants. We can instead use getProviders(Criteria criteria, boolean enabledOnly) and cycle the resultant list, first with a fine criteria and then a coarse criteria. When actually requesting the location to be found, we first try the GPS and then we try the network provider. Instead, we should first try a fine provider and then try a coarse provider if that one times out. If no fine provider exists, we use a coarse provider, and fail upon timeout. (In the onTimeout method, instead of checking whether the provider's string matches the GPS or NETWORK constants, we should find the LocationProvider by that string, and check its accuracy level.) This may actually not be much work.

Also only useful once our data is remotely valid for the 112th Congress (not 'til May or June of 2011). Even then, the app will have to know when its data is not valid for a given session, by the quarter, so that it doesn't even try to show Q42012 data when 2013 rolls around. Fortunately, the Mayan calendar indicates this eventuality is unlikely.

		This is getting stored in data, not cache, so I'm not sure what to do. We could store a timestamp of when it got seen and wait X months before flushing. But I'm worried about storing dates in SQLite, honestly, after my failed attempt to migrate the bills table. Maybe upon each update of the table, we could flush out the oldest X entries for that subscription type, where X is some multiple of the number of entries fetched by the subscriber. So for bills, where it fetches 40, we could have it flush anything besides the most recent 80 or 120 entries. Age could be determined by ordering on the autoincrementing _id, instead of making a new timestamp field. This can be decided in a future update.

		I want this self contained in the Footer somehow, or at least not something that adds a footprint to every Activity that uses one. Saving state across screen flips so that an AsyncTask could still update the UI after completion would necessitate writing code in the Activity, as far as I can see. So, have the footer instantly go on or off visually, and then either: Spawn the database operation off into an AsyncTask where the completion callback doesn't interact with the UI at all. Unsure how robust this is, but I think it would work. AsyncTasks don't get killed when an activity exits, under normal conditions anyway. Run an IntentService that does the work. More theoretically robust, but involves a new class or two, and passing subscription information via intents, etc. I'm more a fan of number 1 for now. Both mean that if the save operation fails for some reason, the only recourse is a toast alert that would contradict the successful visual feedback that the user just saw. I think it's worth it for the speed; I got two or three ANRs just messing around, earlier, on my Nexus One.

		Though I can't think of an immediate practical case, it could certainly happen. Right now the check to see if one has a subscription is whether or not any entries have been made. One gets made for each item in the list. The best way to do it might be to always create one new entry for a subscription, with a null &quot;seen_id&quot; field. It'll get cleared along with the rest, will not trigger as an instance of anything being seen that hasn't, and should work.

		Besides the aid in debugging odd seeming things, it'd be a nice UX feature. The NotificationService would have to package the array of strings of new IDs into a consistent extra on any Intent it packs into the notification. Each activity would be responsible for storing the new IDs, or passing them into the constructor for the list adapter, so that the list adapter knows to highlight or otherwise mark each list item. The best way is to probably just alter the background color of new items with a consistent shade, stored in colors.xml. Having to add code to each list of which one can be notified is annoying, but maybe only necessary for long lists like BillList, RollList, and LegislatorList (if we get cosponsor notifications running).

		It would take care of: Defining a &quot;Date&quot; subitem, and require the subclass to define a method to map items to their date. It would take care of inserting the date wherever it changed. It would inflate the date view and insert the date into it. Subclasses could optionally override the dateformat or even the whole inflation. Optionally accept an array of IDs to highlight, as long as the subclass has overridden the method to map an item to its ID. It would take the getView method that the subclass implements and insert it into a frame inside of a bigger view, with room for a highlight effect (depending on how the highlight effect should be implemented). In future, we could implement the &quot;sticky header&quot; effect on dates, or whatever, all through this adapter. This would seem to be applicable both to activities and fragments, and wouldn't require full fragmentization of Roll-, Bill-, and LegislatorList.

		Tentative idea: tapping on star brings down a pane of checkboxes of things to subscribe to. Pane can be dismissed, and subscribing to anything yellows the star. Tapping the star brings down the same pane, to edit the selection. Unhandled: How does someone follow a person or bill without needing notifications enabled? (i.e. shortcut menu) Possibly this can be ignored, and the concept of subscription-less favorites scrapped. How do we handle when someone has notifications disabled? Is this a way to guide someone into enabling them? How should this look? How do we not be obnoxious to people who don't have notifications enabled? Possibly: the pane without notifications enabled displays copy and a button to take you to the notification settings screen, or simply turns on notifications in-place.

		There's a set of things to be done to ready the app for the Kindle Fire. If this is pursued, these might be broken out into separate tickets. Look at any low-hanging-fruit design choices you can make to optimize for &quot;large&quot; type screens. Mark location as optional in the manifest, and explicitly check for this feature when generating LegislatorList. Remove the item to search by location. Double check for the feature right before the actual location call gets made. Mark telephony as optional in the manifest, and explicitly check for this feature when generating LegislatorProfile. Remove the call option. The Kindle Fire comes with an email client, and Amazon says it responds to email intents, but I witnessed a crash when I tried it. Figure out how to generalize it to work on any Android device. Remove the district map button if Google Services (the Maps app) are not installed. Make sure the &quot;Share&quot; intent for bills still works as advertised.

		It's inevitable that if a bill is noticed as happening in two separate sources, it appears twice in the web service. Given the structure of the data, I don't think the server needs to change. So, dedupe the list on the client-side, inside the transform method in UpcomingAdapter. This method is where we'll centralize all aggregation and display logic.

		This is really more of an RTC issue, but to keep the work together - &quot;sopa&quot; should find the Stop Online Piracy Act, and it should be the top result. To do this, create two fields on bills/bill_versions, and make them searchable, &quot;nicknames&quot;, and &quot;possible_nicknames&quot;. Start automatically calculating possible acronyms upon index, and adding them to the &quot;possible_nicknames&quot; field as an array. Create a CSV, by hand, with known acronyms, publish them on Github somewhere, and start wiring these acronyms into the &quot;acronyms&quot; field on index, by wgetting the file from Github directly. This will work for a long, long time, and is not a load on Github (twice a day, tiny file). Starting examples: &quot;sopa&quot; =&gt; SOPA, &quot;pipa&quot; =&gt; PIPA, &quot;obamacare&quot; =&gt; [PPACA, Reconciliation] Boost the &quot;nicknames&quot; field so that it gets a ton of precedence in scoring. Make it publicly known that we're keeping this file, and welcome contributions from OC, GovTrack, others.

		I'd really like to get draft bills from docs.house.gov in there - this will require changes. I plan to continue to use bill_id as a present, unique field, but its format may be something different, like hr[epoch]-112, with a draft: true field set, or something. This will only affect versions of the app using the Congress API, so it's okay to change app architecture to not hinge on bill_id so explicitly, if it ships with the first version of the app that uses the Congress API.

		@konklone discusses publishing to F-Droid in this discussion thread: In order to support F-Droid, I will need to:

* make it so if analytics is disabled through a configuration flag, this also activates graceful handling of the Google Analytics JAR being missing entirely.
* also, if analytics is disabled, do not include a menu option that goes to the Settings activity in the main screen.
* write a build script that does this work as part of the fdroid build process - and in general, automate as much of [the manual](https://f-droid.org/manual/) as possible.
 I haven't yet firmly decided to do this - it is a non-trivial amount of work. However, if it is done, it'll be done in a manner that doesn't require maintaining a separate branch. Other requirements: Deal with an API key that I don't want to commit to source control Other values in keys.xml, like our contact email, debug flags, etc.

		BillLoader and LegislatorLoader were originally added because back in the day when I was using TabActivity, there was an absurd bug where if you loaded the TabActivity without any tabs added, it would crash when not in touch mode (when in trackball mode). Now that we're using an Activity that loads ViewPager'd fragments, this isn't a problem, so we should be able to move the background network fetching into the Activities with the ViewPager themselves. This would also have to address the path that notifications to bill and legislator info take when tapped.

		The new Google Maps app has finally killed its ability to take a URL to a KML file and display it - so, our hand is forced and we need to do direct integration, like the iOS app does. I'd prefer to do this with TileMill/MapBox, like the iOS app does. There is no official Android SDK, but there are open source alternatives like OSMDroid. It's an open question whether to use that, or just use the Google SDK.

		I'm shipping a pretty crude map today. It could use a lot of help going forward. Here are some things to remember: the Mapbox Android SDK may add better native support for GeoJSON - https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk/issues/331 is good but https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk/issues/330 is needed too. Alaska is way too zoomed out, despite some optimizations just for its special nature zooming is crazy and impossible scrolling is a bit jerky, when it works at all, and can conflict with swiping from tab to tab the shape needs shading, and the line needs to be more attractive it'd be nice to cache the map tiles so they don't need to be re-downloaded (shouldn't this be happening already?)
