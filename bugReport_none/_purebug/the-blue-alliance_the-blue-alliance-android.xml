		As per the Settings documentation: Note: If you're developing your application for Android 3.0 and higher, you should instead use PreferenceFragment. Go to the next section about Using Preference Fragments. Nearly all of the methods in PreferenceActivity are deprecated, and using a PreferenceFragment is the clear recommendation. This would also eliminate the need for Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB checks and related annotations.

		The easiest way to reproduce this is to open and close an event in one week, switch to another week, open and close another event, then switch once more to a different week, and find that tapping other events does nothing. Sometimes an event will open as seen in the YT video, but switching again to another week brings back its odd behavior. Can be fixed by rotating screen, loading an event from a team info page, or reloading the app. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3bZMgyvwTI

		I noticed when viewing various Team @ Event pages is that the alliances for that event are always shown, even if that team wasn't picked by an alliance for elims which, to me, feels a bit pointless. Would it be possible to hide the alliances tab if say, there isn't any data on that team for elims? Or display a text like &quot;This team did not advance to eliminations&quot;? For a team that did advance to elims, displaying all 8 alliances with the current format might make it hard for users to find their team. I was thinking either bolding the team, or just displaying the alliance that team is on.

As a result, the first dropdown item is always 2014 events/media, second dropdown item is always 2013 events/media, third is always 2012 events/media..., etc so teams with gaps in years participating or that didn't participate in 2014 have participating years display no events or wrong events.

			<description>
		My lack of experience with Android is really slowing down the development process on this. Let me outline how I believe the refreshing scheme should work. A refresh will consist of three steps: render, update, and render. Refreshes are triggered when starting an Activity or when the user manually refreshes. To support this, each Fragment needs to implement render() an update(). render() makes the appropriate SQL queries locally to fetch all the models needed to render a page, and then populates the Fragment with that info. It must be able to handle cases where not all data is in the local DB and display as much as possible. If feasible, each unique query should hold a lock with the result temporarily cached within the scope of the Activity, so multiple concurrent Fragments making the same queries can reuse the result. update() makes the fewest number of API calls needed to populate the local DB with everything the Fragment needs to render. Upon receiving an API response, we need to drop all table rows associated with that response (this should always be possible due to the way API endpoints are setup). For example, after receiving a response from /api/v2/team/frc254/event/2014casj/awards, award table rows satisfying the query eventKey = 2014casj AND winners LIKE %254% must be dropped (this isn't the most efficient, but will do for now) and new rows constructed from the response must be inserted. Also, the cached value of the SQL query made in render() must also be dropped. One key implementation detail of the update() method is that locks must be held for each unique API endpoint. This way, concurrent updates from multiple fragments that hit the same API endpoint don't make multiple requests to the same endpoint at once, and after one returns, we can rely on the API rate limit to prevent hitting the endpoint again. We should start by implementing everything without any of the caching and locks (but keeping them in mind) and adding them after.

		Doing a web search on the phone for madtown throwdown webcast, the second result is for The Blue Alliance. Tapping that offers to open Chrome or TBA app. So pick the app. (It's great that Google provides a TBA search result but unfortunately the link is just to TBA home page, not the event page.) Picking TBA app shows the 2014 Events screen, &quot;Week 1&quot; tab. The URL didn't have the info to get directly to the relevant event, but the app could use today's date to pick the most relevant tab (&quot;Offseason events&quot;). After navigating to the event screen, I don't see how to get the webcast. There is a YouTube link that searches for videos mastching 2014mttd, none of them relevant. The desktop version of TBA home page links to the the Gameday page embedding the YouTube webcast. So if I Back up to step (1) and pick Chrome [1], the TBA mobile home page also has a Gameday page link. Tapping that again asks if I want to open it in Chrome or TBA app. Picking TBA app opens the right info screen for this Event, but no webcast. Picking Chrome gets a similar mobile page, also with webcast aid. It'll issue a different YouTube query #frcmttd OR &quot;MadTown ThrowDown&quot;, which also doesn't work. [1] TBA app crashed at that point. Android sent a crash report. This is from a Nexus 5 running KitKat.

		This bug hasn't actually occurred, but I spotted the potential for it while looking for the source. I'll outline the potential scenario: A new event is added to the FIRST database. This get's pulled in by TBA. A user opens the event list on his/her device; the new event loads. That user favorites a event on one devices. The server sends a GCM message to another device that downloads the new list of favorites. The user opens myTBA on the second device without downloading the new event list. It attempts to load the list of favorites, but the new event is not in the local database. The app crashes. The user is sad. I guess the best way to fix this is simply to hide any entities that don't exist locally when loading the favorites list. That's probably an easy fix. However, I'm too tired to fix this now, so I'm just making note of it here.

		Hey fellas. Having some issues with the favorites screen. I went to an event (Kettering, but I don't think specifics matter), went to Teams, clicked 2337, clicked &quot;Show Team&quot;, click the star, and got the favorites page. After checking a few boxes, I tried to hit the check mark, but nothing happened. After going back and trying to click the Star again to get back in to the interface, I was stuck on the Team screen After going back (which didn't bring me back to the list of Kettering teams - it brought me to the list of all the teams 😓) I went back to 2337 and clicked the star and got an empty interface Just having a lot of issues with navigation and data loading and whatnot with that favorite screen.

		I just noticed that I am getting notifications for upcoming matches of my team: but I did not subscribe for that kind of notification: So why do I get both upcoming match notifications AND score notifications? I did remove the app and reinstall it to clean up any issues related to getting data to early in the season. Could it be that any notifications I set then are in effect even though my client thinks differently? I saw nothing subscribed when I reran the app after the reinstall so I resubscribed to just match scores. I wonder if the server has a different view of what I want.

		I don't think the tabs really do a whole lot; if a user is looking for a specific team, they'll probably just search for it instead of swiping through some tabs and then scrolling through a list of 1000 teams. The tabs don't really do any harm by being there, but they don't really do much for the user, either. Commence debate.

		Add Retrofit library and define an API interface with a single endpoint (use hose tba.com/api/v2) with the endpoint as a single paramter. This way, we can use Retrofit's capability to return an Observable with the network result. We need to migrate our network stack to work with Observables and have something consume them. We will need to refactor RefreshableHost a bit. I'm thinking it consumes all incoming network Observables for the Activity. The child Fragments can report which endpoints they require (some public static final variable, maybe) and be notified when each endpoint comes in, and when all requests are loaded. The RefreshableHost will hold all the content, which the children can query and process. This allows us to eliminate all the Populate* tasks

		When I was first building the user info view (header, photo, name) in the nav drawer, I used our Lord Duarte's picture and name as placeholder data to test out how everything displayed. That stuff seems to still be there, although I've only seen it in debug builds, nothing that would be visible in production builds. However, it should still really be removed from our codebase. Part 2 of this (probably should be a separate issue) is that we really need a proper header in the nav drawer for users that aren't signed into myTBA. Perhaps something blue with the TBA logo? We need an art team...

Handling this properly will be interesting, because the number of teams we have in the database could change if we load in additional teams while the team lists are showing. Observable magic to the rescue? Or fire something on the EventBus when new teams are loaded and then check if we have to recompute the tabs? Open to ideas on the best way to handle this.

		From a (1 star) Play Store review:  Getting error code (-505) Google's troubleshooting steps all failed. Uninstalled the app to reinstall and now I still can't install it and I don't have the old version either. Unrooted SGS 4
 This doesn't appear to be an issue on our side, it's most likely an issue with 5.0 itself: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/88214/how-do-i-deal-with-unknown-installation-error-code-505 We're going to try to get the reviewer to communicate with us via this issue so we can try to do further troubleshooting.

This will require some server side changes Integrate Imgur API into app2 Make a background thread thing (probably IntentService?) to take image on device, upload to imgur3, and suggest to TBA. Use persistent notification for status updates. Be sure to handle lots of cases: TCP Timeout, imgur error, rate limit hit Frontend Tasks Make a button to take a picture on Team or Team@Event page (do we want to be able to choose+upload existing picture?) Prompt user for image title and description. Provide sane defaults. Fire off above task 1 Cloud Endpoints Suggestion Needs to have: User (done via oauth). Will need to have account signed in/myTBA enabled Team Key Year Suggestion &quot;kind&quot; (media in this case) Imgur url Metadata (in this case, we want to pass deletehash up to the server so we can modify the image in the future, even though it was upload anonymously. And maybe some other stuff?) 2Imgur API Things Docs: https://api.imgur.com/ Other Considerations: Need to register app and get tokens Note rate limiting (1,250 uploads per day or approximately 12,500 requests per day), remaining quota in X-RateLimit-UserLimit response header.

		The webcast list should either be restyled to match the Awards list (no dividers, padding at top), or replaced with a standard non-carded list. The latter may make more sense, as the content is homogenous like a team/event/etc list. We should look into grouping all an event's webcasts into a single card or list item for the case where an event has 2+ webcasts.

		We're still targeting API 22 this season for stability reasons (cans of worms and whatnot), but after champs, we'll bump it. 6.0 changes: http://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html Doze. We currently don't set priorities on our GCM message, but I think it's okay to leave them at normal. Runtime Permissions. We currently request GET_ACCOUNTS and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, which are considered Dangerous Permissions, so we'll have to implement requesting them at runtime. GET_ACCOUNTS is used at install time, I believe, to set up the device account when you sign into myTBA. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is used to store suggested images taken before they're uploaded. I don't think any of the other changes should affect us. This library seems awesome for making runtime permissions easier

If it doesn't claim to be a &quot;ranking&quot; then it won't confuse people about the difference vs. official rankings. How to convey what this value is for? It's a derived value, not an official FIRST value, so would it bother people on the Rankings screen?

		[See TBA Web # 1464.] For 2016 Silicon Valley regional, the app's Team 254 Summary screen shows Record 15 - 0 - 0 while the Rankings screen shows &quot;(8-0-0)&quot;. This looks like a discrepancy. The app could clarify the former as &quot;Total Record&quot; or &quot;All matches&quot; or something, since it includes surrogate matches and playoffs.

		While running a debug build, run the script scripts/test_notification.py awards-posted
 It sends a GCM to the client over adb. The client displays a notification but also logs a stack trace because a SQL constraint rejects an attempt to add the row to the DB without a key. E/SQLiteLog: (1299) abort at 8 in [INSERT INTO awards(name,enum,winners,year) VALUES (?,?,?,?)]: NOT NULL constraint failed: awards.key
E/SQLiteDatabase: Error inserting name=Regional Chairman's Award enum=0 winners=[{&quot;awardee&quot;:null,&quot;team_number&quot;:2067},{&quot;awardee&quot;:null,&quot;team_number&quot;:78},{&quot;awardee&quot;:null,&quot;team_number&quot;:811},{&quot;awardee&quot;:null,&quot;team_number&quot;:2648}] year=2014

 The script's JSON data differs from what the doc page says in that the &quot;event_key&quot;: &quot;2014necmp&quot;, property is at a different level of the data structure, but moving that field to match the doc causes com.google.gson.JsonParseException: Notification data does not contain 'event_key'
 It seems the code is failing to include a DB key in the SQL INSERT.

		Tapping a summary notification sometimes makes the app exit summarily. The OS displays a dialog &quot;The Blue Alliance Debug has stopped&quot; over the home screen. There's no acknowledgement of the crash in logcat (!) even with filters turned off but Android Studio's Run view displays a stack traceback. The stack has no TBA code but it does have third party library code io.nlopez.smartadapters. This occurs in the current master branch and also in the branch issue_774 where I'm testing a fix for #774. W/GAv4: Discarding hit.

E/GAv4: Successfully bound to service but never got onServiceConnected callback
Application terminated.
 Steps to (sometimes) reproduce: Start an Android API level 21 or later emulator. Launch the app. Tap the Back button to return to the home screen. From a terminal window in the the-blue-alliance-android/ directory, run scripts/test_notification.py upcoming-match. This should open a heads-up notification shade. Wait for the notification shade to roll up. (This step might not be needed.) Run scripts/test_notification.py match-score. This should open another heads-up notification shade. Pull down the heads-up notification shade. This should reveal TBA's summary notification, &quot;2 new notifications&quot;. Tap on the summary notification's content area.

		When a second or later notification arrives during MadTown ThrowDown this weekend, the notification shade chimes and re-displays the oldest notification that wasn't dismissed instead of accumulating a group summary notification. (I'll try to debug it when I get a chance.)
