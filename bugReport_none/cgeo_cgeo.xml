		With the change of developers we must update about-information: Although Carnero made the most of the code, he isn't the main developer anymore. In my oppinion we should remove the entry &quot;author&quot; and list him (at the top) and all other developers under &quot;contributors&quot;. Also &quot;powered_by&quot; =&quot; Carnero&quot; should be replaced with a more generic term, such as &quot;geocachers of the world&quot; (I'm open to other suggestions. :D )

		From Facebook: It looks like opensource c:geo does not work on Android 1.5. This issue and many others will be fixed in next few weeks. July 9 at 3:56am Any updates on this yet?? Those of us stuck with Android 1.5 phones due to the manufacturers not updating the version are patiently waiting! I have a Motorola i1, and that phone is only 3 months old and stuck forever on Android 1.5 so it can support the iDEN Direct Connect network. Carnero and the official app have always supported down to 1.5, so i hope the opensource version continues as you have stated you would.

		With version 2.26, I have experienced this several times: with the live map, I switch to satellite view and zoom all the way in. On several occasion, I have received a FC error. This may not be a c:geo error, but I never had the problem with the pre-open-source version.

		When viewing the list of saved caches and clicking view map, the map view loads non-saved caches. To reproduce: Save a few caches. From the main menu click &quot;Stored&quot; Click the map icon on the upper edge. The map now contains caches that are not in the stored cache list.

		In map view (both live map, map of stored caches and map of individual caches) all cache icons disappear if the zoom level is low enough. The caches appear at first, but disappear once the search indicator in the upper right hand corner disappears. This could make sense in live map, where one does not want to load every cache in the whole world if one zooms out to view the entire world, but this is not what's going on here, as it also affects the stored cache and individual cache maps, and caches that are already loaded also disappear.

		When using the live map, caches that I own or have already found appear in the map, even though I have opted to hide them. Steps to reproduce: In the settings, select &quot;Exclude own and found caches&quot;. From the main menu, select &quot;Live map&quot;. Disable follow position (optional). Scroll to an area where you have found or own caches. What should happen: Caches you own or have found should not appear. What does happen: All caches, including caches you have found or own, appear. After loading is complete, the found and owned caches disappear. If the map is moved (triggering a new search) the caches temporarily re-appear.

			<description>
		GPS accuracy on some android devices can be improved a lot by dampening GPS coordinates. the free app &quot;GPS status&quot; by EclipSim allows four levels of filtering, none, weak, medium, strong. When switching from weak to medium on my Galaxy S I9000, the GPS accuracy improved considerably. The downside is that it takes longer to react. But when navigating only a few meters in search for a cache, I prefer accuracy over speed. Maybe it would even be possible to use GPS Status / Radar to navigate to caches in addition to the builtin compass?

			<description>
		First and foremost: I don't want to introduce any unnecessary formalism. And I strongly believe in &quot;Release early, release often&quot;. Nevertheless I wanted to ask if we are going to have some kind of planned (or expected) releases. For instance last week a new release was created on Friday, so that all cachers would be able to use the new version over the weekend. I'm mainly asking because I refactored all the code relating to calling external applications (navigation, maps, ...) which led to a lot of changes. And I just want to know when will be a good time to release large changes (which may introduce new bugs, even if you do a lot of testing beforehand). Currently I will hold back my changes until the weekend is nearly over, assuming that releasing on Sunday evening will have the smallest impact, if any bugs slipped through. BTW: Would something like this better be discussed in the wiki? I have never worked with GitHubs wiki before.

		Hi, it happens quite offten to me that c:geo crashes when loading details of the cache. I use c:geo 2.25 on HTC Wildfire with Android 2.2.1. It doesn't matter if it is from map or searchlist or nearby list. After selecting/taping to the cache to display its details, sometimes it happens that it displays the splash screen &quot;Loading the cache details&quot; and then after some time the phone displays an errormessage and goes back to the map/list.

		On a completely new device I just had an exception caused by a null map file name. This name is then used by mapforge to verify it as a valid file name. I was able to work around that issue with commit bf92bf3. Nevertheless someone with more experience in the map code should verify that the default value null for the map file name doesn't cause other problems, as I don't really know the remaining map code. From the commit history it looks like a user &quot;Rainer&quot; added the mapsforge implementation, but I don't find an assignee with that username.

		I'm not sure if something can be easily done about this. It's not a big deal, but I figured I'd toss it out there. The new feature to make trackables visited in the setup is wonderful, however, when logging a Will attend, DNF, write note, etc, it still visits all the trackables. I'm sure most folk only visit their trackables on a found log. Is it possible to revert the trackables to do nothing when the log type is changed? If not, it's no big deal. Since 99% of my logs are found it, it's not anything major to have to manually change it on the few other logs. Thanks!

		Especially for Mystery and Multicaches the listings sometimes contain waypoints without coordinates.

But when I refresh the data in c:geo, my modifications are LOST !!! :-( IMO nothing entered by the user should ever get lost: Not by Refresh, not by GPX import not by anything else. IMO these modifications should even be stored independently of whether the cache itself ist stored for offline use or not.

The only difference I see is that people do have to have a Google account to use chrome-to-phone, but I bet this is the case for 99,9% of our Android users.

		Huh? I just tried C:geo extensively. I found 4 caches, and did not find 2. I logged through c:geo on site. In other words, right after the find (or not) I logged in C:geo, and sent the log. The logging order should be 1: @ 14:10 2: @ 14:45 3: @ 14:55 4: @ 15:25 5: @ 15:35 6: @ 15:45 yet in actuallity the logs are sorted like so: 1: @ 14:45 (found) 2: @ 15:25 (not found) 3: @ 15:35 (found) 4: @ 15:45 (not found) 5: @ 14:10 (found) 6: @ 14:55 (found) (going UP in recent logs). It is as if c:geo &quot;held on&quot; to my logs before sending them? Any clues how this could happen? It is frustrating like H*l when you do multiple searches / finds / not founds in a day.

		Hi, it happens quite offten to me that c:geo crashes when loading details of the cache. I reported this about c:geo 2.25, but it is the same with c:geo opensource 2.26 R3. I use HTC Wildfire with Android 2.2.1. It doesn't matter if I chose to display cache details from map or searchlist or nearby list. After selecting/taping to the cache to display its details, sometimes it happens that it displays the splash screen &quot;Loading the cache details&quot; and then after some time the phone displays an errormessage and goes back to the map/list. When I try to display the same cache details again afterwards, it loads with no problem. Lack of memory? Timeout? (HTC Wildfire is quite slow and low memory device and the signal was not so good.) In addition I have to report that c:geo crashes now more often also while moving through a map. (Actually, I must say that after last week of hard geocaching during my vacation I got very upset about restarting c:geo all the time because of crashing, not loading maps, not loading caches, not loading cache details, displaying all caches on wrong coordinates, etc.). :( I know you are mostly doing this for free and thank you for the job, and I will just pray that you manage to fix all this asap.)

It usually displays only the blue pointer on a blank map and then after some 10 seconds it jumps back to the correct location. Is this necessary?

		I was just doing some testing and I discovered that every time I attempt to log a cache that is stored in one of my lists, I receive a notice that says it appears my log failed to upload to geocaching.com. In truth, the log did go though. Upon dropping the cache from the list, the log publishes flawlessly. I tested this on several caches and got the same results.

		Is there a plan for a &quot;Solved Mysteries&quot; function ? It would be nice, if you could add a waypoint, and mark it as Final Location, and then when you use Live Map or Nearby caches, it would pop up using the final coordiantes instead of the original. I have coordinates for 100's of solved mysteries, because I never know when I am near them, as it is often that the distance between original coordinates and solved coordinates are to far.

		Hi! When trying to see the compass, I'm always getting the message &quot;This cache has no coordinates&quot;. I have an account on geocaching. Going on the site, I can see the coordinates for a given geocache, but on my phone, I keep seeing always the same message.

		Hi. When switching from old c:geo to c:geo opensource, I did a backup/restore of my data. For lots of those caches (Mystery Finals mainly) i stored POIs in Locus. As you may know, Locus provides an POI option to directly switch back to the c:geo cache details after a POI has been created from &quot;c:geo-&gt;Show on Map-&gt;Locus&quot;. This is working for new stored caches, but not with the ones that have been imported. Locus even throws an exception. The last entry from the stack trace reads: &quot;ActivityNotFoundException: Unable to find explicit activity class {carnero.cgeo/carnero.cgeo.cgeodetail}; have you declared this activity in your AndroidManifest.xml?&quot; Any idea why this isn't working? Did Locus have some kind of old reference thats not working after re-import of the caches? Or isn't c:geo opensource accepting the &quot;old&quot; references at all? Incompatible? TIA, Rev

		I am using the last nightly NB29.08.2011 but I am quite sure, that I have seen the problem before sporadically. However now I have a TB to reproduce it: If you open TB2EZMF with c:geo you will see a discover from 27.03.2011 but it is without text. If you look the same at gc.com you will see it actually has text : &quot;Ein dickes Plek, bestimmt gut zum Bassspielen &quot; If you look further down on the same TB-log you will see a &quot;placed&quot; log from 27.03.2011 on gc.com. This one is not shown at all in c:geo. More down there is a another discover on the same date by user &quot;blueguy&quot; on gc.com This one is also not shown in c:geo. More down there is a discover from from user &quot;Thomas S&quot; on gc.com On c:geo this discover is shown but for a wrong username (Blueguy). Maybe this has something to do with several logs on the same date ?? I hope you can reproduce this one.

			<description>
		I've been working on small tweaks to the user interface as I get comfortable with c:geo's source code. Now I wanted to work a bit on the action bars. I realize that aesthetics vary from person to person, so I wanted to reach some agreement before I put in the work. Essentially, I wanted to retouch a few spots to bring the action bars closer to the Android standard, if you can call it that -- everyone seems to implement their action bars slightly differently, but there are a few common points. The tone is more or less set by the Google I/O app which is supposed to be the gold standard for Android UI patterns: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.iosched I think that we should follow those patterns as well. Anyway, my proposals: Make the vertical separator cover the whole height of the action bar (so that the action buttons really look like buttons); Add a separator currently missing in the leftmost button in the right group, for example, in http://cgeo.org/content/images/screenshots/s2.png the map button should have a separator on the left; Remove the separator paddings to make the buttons look square instead of rectangular, with the benefit that we win a bit of horizontal space Remove the separator next to the c:geo icon in the main activity I can do this myself, and in fact already started, but as I said, I wanted to get your agreement before changing the action bars in every activity.

Since the background is just a simple gradient, it can be replaced by an XML shape drawable. This change alone will immediately shave around 80KB off the apk. The only possible issue is that on close inspection the background bitmap has a subtle &quot;roughness&quot; to it which I can't tell if it's by design or result of image compression.

		We should put the contents of readme and buildnotes together into one file readme.md. That file is then displayed with markup directly on the cgeo source page on github. For an example have a look at the contents of https://github.com/infinitest/infinitest (below the source list). Everything you see there is a simple text file at https://raw.github.com/infinitest/infinitest/master/README.md

		The drawable-mdpi only contains files which are duplicate from the ones in drawable. This is because Android 1.5 uses mdpi resolution and isn't able to find the mdpi folder, so all of its images need to be in drawable. As it is, it makes no sense to keep the drawable-mdpi folder around. It's making the program file bigger with zero benefit.

		I quite often store a cache for offline use after just looking at it, and every time c:geo seems to need to download the cache again! I wonder why that is, as it has just downloaded the same info and should still hold it (after all the cache is still displayed!). Sometimes that second download can take a while and is annoying.

			<description>
		With &quot;Don't show found or owned caches&quot; set, in live map, found / owned caches flicker on and off, seemingly at random. Activate Live/Inactivate Live merely changes precisely which caches flicker or disappear or show up, and not in any rational way. Seemingly. There's probably a very predictable mechanism at work, but I cannot see what the misbehaviour depends on. &quot;flicker&quot; is triggered by Time, wait long enough and caches will disappear or reappear Moving, move the map so that a cache site gets inside the map area shown and you get flicker all over, If a found cache is shown, looking at the description shows no &quot;Found&quot; label.

		When I try to click on a go4cache icon (red dot) on the live-map while using OSM it is very difficult to get the info-window open. Doing the same while Google Maps is active is much easier (as it should be). It is like the accepted radius for tapping on the screen is much lower when OSM is displayed.

		Suddenly cgeo starts failing to log in on GC.com. The official gc app works fine. The login procedure reports Unknown error.... I don't know where else to report this. I tried reentering the login data, but nogo. Groundspeak's own app works fine, provably.

		The cache details activity has 6 (!!!) different progress dialogs as fields. I'd like to completely remove those and instead have one progress dialog wrapper class which internally manages one progress dialog, but takes away all the resource management. The only open question I have: Is it possible to have multiple progress dialogs shown concurrently in Android? And if so, does that make sense? Do we use something like that somewhere? I'm asking because I would like to write that wrapper in such a way, that there can be only one progress dialog at any time. Simplifies things a lot.

		I have found several caches and submitted my find online. When I look at a live map it does not give me the smiley face. If you click on the cache and open it - it will say found - and my log post is there. Why am I not getting the smiley face? I keep going to a bunch of caches thinking I have them to do - but in fact when I open the cache - then realize I have found it already. Am I doing something wrong? Also, since I am new to the geocaching thing - perhaps most of this is my fault? Why when I try and log a find online (using my Moto Droid) SOMETIMES - it says the cache is not available and it will only let me SAVE for offline use? Also - last question -- I just did my first &quot;series&quot;. Is there a way to change the coordinates on my gps? Example -- had to find 7 caches - each had a clue to the GPS coordinates of the FINAL CACHE. Using C:Geo -- is there a way that I can enter those coordinates AFTER I found them all? Again using the Motorola Droid - the c:geo is my ONLY source of navigation/GPS. This app is AWESOME!!! I love it - just not sure if its me or is there something wrong?

		I'd like to refactor cgCache. First I'd like to change the direct access of the members into getters and setters method calls. Second, I'd like to introduce a class hierachy. An interface &quot;ILogable&quot; with basic operations for all kind of caches, trackables, challenges. Different implementations like GCCache, Trackable, OCCache, Challenge and so on. Your opinion on that ?

			<description>
		When a gpx file from a pocket query is imported that has a waypoints file attached, the progress bar shows correct progress for importing the cache file, wrong progress for the waypoints file and no progress for storing the caches in DB. Reason is that the progress bar is initialized once with the size of the cache file in cgeogpxes but not updated later for the import of the waypoints file or when storing the caches. Control is handed over to GPXParser that doesn't know about the progress bar. My proposal is to put control over file handling and storing of caches into cgeogpxes and remove it from GPXParser. GPXParser gets rid of all the static methods and provides only: Collection parse(InputStream, Handler) Simple API, nicely testable. Ok, LocParser would need some more rework. This refactoring would also make it easier to add support for importing pocket query zips directly. What do you think?

		it is really disconcerting to have c:geo search my whole Android every time I am trying to import a GPX file. Not only does that take much time, but it also finds GPX files from other applications. You should really add a preference/setting which directories it should look into for imports (and default that to one sane choice)

			<description>
		(Using NB1311- 01a6ad6) After updating my phone (Samsung Galaxy SII) to Android 2.3.4 I have a strange problem: When using the coordinates input (e.g. by &quot;Any destination&quot;) with the input helper (format: DDD MM.MMM) all the fields are preselected on access as usual. This means when I start typing the previous content is replaced by the numbers I enter. This is still working normal in all fields except for the MM input of longitude: After entering the DDD information the focus jumps to the MM field and the content is preselected normally, but if I input some digits they are just appended to the exisiting digits. The MMM field is again working normal. The strange thing is, that if I selected the android default keyboard instead of the Swype keyboard it is working normal again. Now you could say, that this is a pure Samsung-Swype problem, but I found out the following: If I use the latest market version (instead of the NB mentioned above) the behaviour changes a little bit. With this version the same problem also occurs in the MM field of the latitude (North/south) coordinates. This field was OK in the NB-version. This brings me to the conclusion that the problem is based by the Swype-keyboard but also somehow related to a programming issue. I hope you can follow my explanations...it is a little hard to describe the problem.

In order to avoid user complaints and misunderstandings I would suggest to show the normal &quot;Log&quot; at first and only change to &quot;Logging not possible&quot; after it has been detected that the network is not available.

		I am beginning to feel that this problem is unique to me... I launched c:geo today after not having used ti for several days. It appeared that we were still logged in. I was having some issues getting a 3G connection, so I rebooted my phone. after that, I launched c:geo and logged in. Everything worked just fine as we found our first cache of the day. We then drove, about 10 minutes, to a second cache. When we got there, I launched c:geo and we were logged out. I know this happened because a) the locations of the caches 'jumped' and b) a nearby cache we had found no longer showed the smiley. I again logged in, and after a minute or so, the smiley reappeared. What happened next, however, was truly strange. We found the cache using the map view/google satellite. The location of the cache appeared to be within 5 meters of our location as shown in the map. However, the cache information page indicated that the cache was 30+ meters away. I then used a separate program to grab the current GPS location. Using a distance calculator showed that the GPS location was within 8 meters of the cache location. So, why did the info page indicate the distance was 30+ meters even though the location was properly displayed on the map?

		I am not sure, whether it is intended to work in that way: Today I did GC1Z71W. This cache has 10 waypoints (Stages of a Multi Cache). For all of them I added the coordinates in c:geo as I found them. Now I updated the cache-details and found, that all my modified waypoints are again replaced by the waypoints from gc.com (with empty coordinates). I think, this should not happen as the user might loose coordinates he needs for completing a multi-cache he already started, and I am quite sure that the behavior was different in older versions ?! I am using the RC-version downloaded 23.12.2011.

		I recently figured out that one can switch the default view to a map view when clicking on the navigate button in the overlay / details view. Thats fine and all, I usually use GMaps Terrain for a better overview where a cache is placed, but occasionally I still use the simple compass. Now when I set any map as default view, I apparently cannot switch back to the compass view, but I can reach any map view through the compass. It would be cool if the other way would work as well...

			<description>
		I have seen this issue several times, but can not clearly say, under which condition it happens: I have a list containing my solved mysteries (where I have modified coordinates on gc.com). Initially they were all correctly stored (modified coordinates as cache-coordinates + additional waypoint with original coordinates). After some days I access the list again and find that the cache-coordinates are back to the original coordinates, and only after updating the caches from web again they are OK. My first assumption was, that if the caches are loaded on live-map (which might be the case), they are somehow overwritten by the original-coordinates. However I tried to reproduce this and I can see, that the cache-icon is shown on the wrong geolocation on live-map (the original coordinates) but after this the saved version was still OK. So two questions: Is it a limit of gc.com, that the coordinates on live-map are not my modified coordinates ? Might this cause the cache-coordinates to be reverted back to original in the saved-list ? Edit: Latest NB as well as new Market Release.

		Recently i figured out there seems to be no way to open a geocache from waypoint. The usecase is as follows: After finishing a cache we were looking for another cache near our position. On the live map i had a lot of final waypoints of mystery caches. I could open the waypoint but had no knowledge about the geocache it belongs to. It would be nice to be able to change to the geocache details view from the waypoint view.

			<description>
		As pull request #921 is closed I think its suitable to open an issue for remaining problems: Stored OC-caches are always marked as not reliable (orange ring) on live map. I guess it is because the live-map can -of course- not verify the coordinates from gc.com. OC-caches should be removed from checking reliability because they are imported from PQs and should therefore be reliable in any case.

Nothing will happen because the add on is still running, just without any window showing. Hitting back a second time will return control to c:geo. I will submit a pull request to fix this.

		When I set &quot;Corrected Coordinates&quot; for a cache on the geocaching.com-website, c:geo can import it and display the cache with the new coordinates on the map. But when I store the cache, c:geo drops these new coordinates after some time (I guess 1-2 days) and replace it by the original ones. As workaround I have to refresh the cache shortly beforce I want to look for it. These bug exists at least for the last 2 versions (including the version &quot;2012-01-04&quot;) on Nexus S.

When I load the live map, the throbber appears, then on cache icon with the [1] in the title but as soon as the loading finishes, they all disappear with the toast about partial data and inaccurate locations. Panning around the map will occasionally make another cache icon appear then disappear in the same way. This still occurs after an uninstall and reinstall from the market and re-entering my geocaching.com login details.

		First thanks for turning this nightly build out so quick after Groundspeaks mapping regression. The live map does grab and show up caches for the area now. However, it doesn't appear to know which caches a user has already found. About 1/2 of my smilies aren't showing up on caches that I've already found. Maybe it's now looking at the logs to determine this. When I click on them and look at the logs for ones that I've already found, the data is several months old. I've also tried setting it to 'exclude my own and found caches' it still shows those that I have found that didn't have a smiley as one would expect. Thanks and keep up the good work.

I've reinstalled it and that still didn't fix this. Worked fine for a few weeks..but just started giving me this error.

		As already mentioned in the initial disscussion of #868 most users not only have one preferred navigation tool. It's the same for me and i was looking for a solution that doesn't pollute the menus nor the action bar, but enables fast access to a second navigation tool. My proposal is to add a second preference for such a second tool. Just a short text explaining how to access it and a spinner to choose the tool like for the first one. Access to the tool is only available via long click at the action bar navigation icon wherever it exists. Currently this will be in the cache details, cache popup (from map) and the waypoint activity. I guess this will improve the navigation handling a lot. What do you think about it? The code is almost complete and i can provide it soon so you can have a look at it and maybe give it a try ...

		The QR code scanner only works with strings that start with http://coord.info/. It does not work if you scan a QR code that is just a GC code or a TB code. The error presented if I scan just a geocode is &quot;Didn't find any geocode in the scan result.&quot; At the very least, the error message should be changed to explain that only scanning http://coord.info/ links will work. I think the best behavior would be to show what was scanned along with the error message. I found a cache today that had a QR code so I scanned it (thinking it would load information about the cache). I just kept getting error messages from c:geo. I finally used my phone's barcode scanner and determined the QR code was just for http://www.geocaching.com I don't want to turn c:geo into a full QR code scanner, but it needs to be clearer what the program is doing and why it might not be working (after all, you usually have no idea what a QR code says when you are scanning it).

		I have noticed that added waypoints never seem to go away. Steps: Store a cache Add waypoints to it Drop the cache (it moves to list ID 0) Wait at least 3 days without accessing that cache (so that the it drops from the database) View the cache again The waypoints are still there While this could be considered a feature, it means the waypoints database just gets bigger and bigger (and probably logs, images, trackable, etc too). I think the problem is in clean function in cgData. It is the one the removes the caches after 3 days. It is using RemoveFlag.REMOVE_CACHE which looks to me that it only removes it from the cache cache and not the database. I believe it should be REMOVE_DB. Can anyone second check this?

		Hello! I just recently tried to download some offline maps as described in the faq. Meaning I followed the link to the mapsforge site, downloaded a pre-made *..map and placed it in a folder (named /Maps). Autosearch worked fine, and I clicked in the menu on &quot;OSM:offline&quot;. However, when actually offline, no maps show up (everything works in online mode). No error message is printed. I checked the region of the map, the region of the cache I want to display and also downloaded other map files, but cannot figure out the source of the problem. Is there anything else I can report for tracking down this issue? Greetings, Puray

		I noticed a very annoying bug on my HTC Desire S device. Every time c:geo loses focus, e.g. switched to another app or the phone lock due to manual lock or display timeout, I need to relaunch c:geo. This can be done either by &quot;relaunching&quot; the app or by holding the home button and select c:geo. In the latter c.geo display the last displayed activity. In the former c:geo goes back to its dashboard and I have to reopen the page displayed before. This is very annoying. I expect c:geo to display exactly the activity which has been active before screen lock or app switching. Seems to affect all versions, current markt, rc and nightly.

		Currently c:geo defaults to the DD/MM/YYYY date format when displaying cache info and logs. It would be better if it did one of the following (sorted by descending desirability): Use the geocaching.com date format. Use the system date format. Offer a configuration option for date format. C:geo already knows the user's geocaching.com selected date format (otherwise it would not be able to parse log dates), so it would be a trivial change to use the same date format for formatting date output as well.

		With the availability of NFC chips to new phones as well as the cheap cost of NFC tags, it would be cool to enable cache owners to add an NFC tag which can be scanned to log the find. Functionally this would work very similar to the QR code scanning currently supported - but more passive.

		(This is a fork of another issue into a feature request. See: cgeo#1368 for details.) As described in the abovementioned issue, the initialization of the live map behaves differently depending on whether you use Google Maps or OSM. Google Maps defaults to the last known (or viewed) position, whereas OSM defaults to some map-default location, somewhere in the middle of Germany. The map initialization should, in my opinion be (in order of relevance): If &quot;center map on current location&quot; is activated and the location service has a fix, fix the map there (if the preference is on, but there is no fix, proceed - the map will relocate once fix has been obtained) If the location service is off, the &quot;center map on current location&quot; is not selected or the location service has not yet obtained a fix on location, use the following, in the order selected by the user in a user settings: Last known position (persists from last time used - skip if live map has never used before) Home location (user setting - skip if none set) If all of the above fails, let library use its default value.

There is small problem with new/empty lists - it is not possible to import anything to them (at least I didn't find that option - only filter and list &quot;buttons&quot; are visible after pressing menu). there is no problem if there is at least one cache already on the list (additional buttons appear).

		It used to work before, but it seems that now it doesn't work anymore: I have a few caches stored for offline, then I log a visit online (found it/write note/whatever), and the log, after it was posted, was shown in the logbook of the stored cache. Or at least it was there if it was still in history. Now it's not there, unless I refresh the cache. This function was very handy for mass drop of found caches...

		Yesterday on my way to solve issue #1364 i found out that: waypoint navigation menu is created on the fly cache navigation menu is created a static way both methods use 2 booleans to filter out 2 menu items cache always shows static maps item although there is no static map waypoint shows static map item only if one is existing So we should refactor this behaviour to: create waypoint and cache navigation both on the fly and kick one method change boolean parameters to a List filter only show StaticMaps entry if existing On my branch I changed the cache method to take a filter list. This seems to be better and more flexible. Any comments?

		I was out caching this weekend using latest build with GPS turned off (using Network for position). I noticed that when I click a cache on the map, often the popup window would open with distance as &quot;--&quot; (the default) and stay that way for up to 30 seconds. I believe this was introduced in 5a10f40 (observer pattern). I think maybe the problem is that cgeopopup is registering for location updates, but no update is getting fired for some period of time (likely longer since I was using Network and not GPS). Sometimes if I wait till it shows a distance, then open other popups from the map, then they will have a distance right away, but sometimes they still don't. I have reproduced this with GPS turned on as well.

		Hi, I'm using c:geo offline very often, so I send caches to c:geo via send2cgeo and then go geocaching in terrain. I'm using lists by location where I'm. But sometimes I go for caches in the same places. I've new and old caches in one list and it's not easily possible to show only new caches. So sometimes I try to hunt some caches which are some months only in my phone. I will be happy when I can click in list &quot;Delete caches older than 30 days&quot; for example.

So caches that I have found with either account are shown as found when logged in to either account.

		EditWaypointActivity does a call to cgCache.save to store &quot;finalDefined&quot; attribute. Unfortunately the cache update flag is not set and so not &quot;detailed&quot; caches skip an update (e.g. GC3FR70). Otherwise detailed caches delete/insert original waypoints invalidating origin waypoint static maps filename ... After the refactoring of issue #1557 adding a possibility to store only cache main table data, this should be used in EditWaypointActivity to store the attribute after setting cache update flag to true. So finalDefined can always be stored and original waypoint static maps filenames will never be invalid.

		Using latest build. Steps: I had imported some caches via GPX I went into the settings and set it to store static maps for caches and waypoints (I normally have it disabled) I connected via wifi (data on the phone was turned off, so wifi was only connection) I viewed one of the lists with OSM offline map (but with no offline map loaded, so it was just blank tiles) I clicked on each cache that was near me so the popup opened I then clicked Refresh in the popup so that static maps would be downloaded Once I was out caching (no more wifi), I scrolled down in the Details window and there were no static maps. I thought maybe I hadn't given it enough time to download before disconnecting the wifi (there is no indication of download start, progressing or completing) But, if I go Menu / Navigate / Static Maps, then the static maps are displayed This happend with all of the caches I refreshed via popup (which I think might be the problem). I think this could be reproduced more simply than all the steps I list above, but I don't have the wifi/data connection to test.

		There are a couple places in the code where the following is used to determine if an error has occurred search.getError() != null. The code assumes that if a non-null value is returned, then an error has occurred. The problem is that the error can be set to StatusCode.NO_ERROR which breaks the logic above. I only see one spot (in GCConnector.java) that actually sets it to NO_ERROR. Here are a couple of ways I see to fix this. Expand all checks to check != null and != NO_ERROR Remove all != null checks and only check != NO_ERROR (requires making sure NO_ERROR is always set) remove NO_ERROR and only use null checks Thoughts? (I realized this as there is a small bug dealing with being offline and viewing caches in history that have been dropped from a list)

		Hi, I've code to upload coords to gc.com, but I don't know, what is the preferred way of working with coords in c:geo. There are two usable methods: never modifiing coordinates of cache, only creating waypoint and uploading to gc.com setting final waypoint as cache coords and uploading to gc.com Please, tell me how to do it and I'll implement it (I'have all needed code) and place a pull request with final version. Thanks for reaction.

		due to the apple patent infringement lawsuit against HTC New devices coming into the USA lost the ability to chose to open cache links in cgeo. now when you click a cache link it will open in browser this appears to be on androids with ics and sense 4.0 they want you to set a default with app associations in settings http://www.imgur.com/IqIEz.jpg http://www.imgur.com/p38os.jpg and unfortunately cgeo isn't a choice http://www.imgur.com/YOhuk.jpg the sense 4.0 automatically sets a default association with the stock browser and if you clear the default it will automatically default to the other available choice and in my case chrome , now I think if cgeo appeared as a browser it would then appear as a choice to open web URLs except the next issue I foresee it all web URLs trying to open with cgeo then getting an error or forceclose is there something that can be done to fix this from searching on the net its an app that strictly runs in the background called htclinkifydispatcher that is blocking the &quot;open link with&quot; popup that would appear prior to apple suing everyone Sent via Hubroid

		I love c:geo and I used to love its map view, but I really start to hate it, because the map view crashes more and more often. I the past crashes used to happen for offline maps but now they do even for online maps (especially &quot;OSM: Mapnik&quot;). PLEASE try to solve this problem (even by using another library if the currently used one is too buggy).

		When planning the next vacation cache tour it would be great to customize the home coordinate. So if there is no GPS signal it would not default to the approximate WiFi location, but use the customized home coordinate instead. This also could solve some issues I had with having no location signal at all. (resulted in home coordinates 6000 km from my location [Germany]) It would be even better to have a favorite home coordinate list, but one customizable home coordinate should be pretty sufficient.

		In reference to Issue #1827 among others. I'm in favour of dropping the geocode as primary key. It would minimise the effects of broken geocodes. I don't like the way the Database is queried anyway. To populate a list for instance we do these three SELECTS. Retrieving the geocodes using the criteria SELECT COUNT using the criteria SELECT IN using the geocodes There are cases where memory is an issue, but not always. See Issue #1777 where the three SELECTS are called directly one after the other. Any views on this?

		In issue #1833 a user wants to export a list of caches to import into another c:geo client. So far I only know that the backup file can be imported into another device. What about a feature to export a list of caches with our own format to transfer almost every data we have? This issue just to ask if we need this. So far we only export in a restricted GC.com GPX format. It fits the requirements on GPS devices but not for import into c:geo.

		From a list of caches, if you choose Menu and then List, you are given two choices: Create new list Change list Clicking Change list gives a listing of all the lists AND an option to create a new list. I propose that when List is clicked, it gives the same menu as when clicking on the name of the list at the top. The only downside I see is that it is an extra tap (and maybe some scrolling) is required to create a new list. But, it is one less click to change lists (for those that don't know about clicking the name)

		Hello, When I search for Nearby caches, I get a list of 20 caches. When I select the map icon, it shows me the map. But only three caches are on them. All 20 caches are within a 2km range so should be on there. It happens for google maps, but also OSM. As it happens the 3 caches are the only caches out of the 20 that used to be stored offline. I dropped them, but they still show up. I remember something about map only showing stored caches, but I couldn't find any info on that. Also read the faq, but I still think the expected the behaviour is to have all 20 caches shown? Is this correct, or am I missing something? Thanks and keep up the good work! I have a free GC account, and login is ok. Using newest 28/6 version.

		http://bcaching.com is greate website which can receive gpxs directly from GC.com via email. It imports them into your personal list of geocaches. You can download them into the android app &quot;GeoBeagle&quot;. However GeoBeagle is much less sophisticated compared to c:geo. So it would be cool to have c:geo connect to bcaching.com also to import those caches into your Offline Caches list. Also an easy way to keep the caches up to date, saving on requests to GC.com. EDIT: Here's info on the bcaching.com API.

		Would it possible to implement a such feature based on GCBuddy app : http://www.btstsoft.nl/apps/gcbuddy/ ? I already had this idea a few months ago and did something on javascript. It works perfectly for me but it is not usable on a mobile device :( Here are the required steps (from my own point of view) : add 1 field &quot;formula&quot; in waypoint add a page for each cache to enter values (A,B,C) and a &quot;compute&quot; coordinates button. User enter values as soon as he gets a new value during the hike. Click &quot;generates&quot; button calculates new coord values for child waypoints with formula (if all required values are present). Technically, javax.script.ScriptEngineManager (or JEXL) could manage eval job. From my experience, user should input himself the formula because extract formula from text's cache is really hard. Used format is not always the same. (x or * for multiplication, ( or [ for input...)

		When I use the live map and click on a cache, you get the short overview from the cache. There you can directly use the navigation (I use the internal compass). When I click on the navigation, I get the compass view. Over the menu in the compass view you can switch from the compass view to the map view. If I use this order c:geo is crashing. Can somebody reproduce this issue? I have this issue only with the OSM. Live map select a cache direct navigation (not details and use the internal compass) switching from compass to map crash I use the HTC Desire HD with Android 2.3.5 regards PS: How can I set the bug label?

		At the moment c:geo already recognizes a coordinate in the personal cache note and treats it as a waypoint which is great. It would be nice though to have the map icon re-positioned to this location. (and change to the icon with a red flag overlay for example to indicate a re-positioned icon like it is done already in the listing of nearby caches which have a &quot;final location&quot; waypoint) The reasoning: I often write the final location of mysteries and multies in the personal field note. Then on the map you can easily see the &quot;actual&quot; cache location while planning your route on the road. also, when placing a cache it can help with checking the proximity of the actual cache locations.

		I'd like to know your opinion on the best way for the user to get updates in a region. From time to time, I try to get new caches in a specific area but using live map, I have to deal with already found caches, disabled and not-up-to-date caches on the map. Either I should load all caches on the screen and clear after, either I manually check status one by one. Is there already a way to get : new caches in a specific area excluding already found refresh caches not up-to-date (saved a long time ago) Thanks for your feedback.

		I suggest implementing it for at least 5 versions back ... to be able to debug new versions or test older versions of c:geo. Now when debugging my proposed pull request it sucessfully upgrades, but when I want to get back to master c:geo or any older version ... it is not possible, because of not implemented database downgrade, I need to uninstall app and after it install the older version and ... set login to geocaching and all other settings.

		I have just installed the latest version on my Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.1 and when viewing my stored caches, the closest ones (which are all disabled) did not appear so (no line through them). If I went to read the content, the line does appear through the name in the description but not the title. When I then go back to the list, the line appears... I then tried this with the next three and all I have to do is look at the description and then go back and it then gets the line. It appears not to be picking up the flag that says it is disabled on the first reading. Still a great app. Thanks Steve

		Some relevance to other discussions of filtering, but this goes further.. In the live map, I have lots (like 5000+) caches displayed from multiple lists - holiday locations, local caches, todo caches, specific cache series, etc etc etc.. The live map just displays them ALL. It would be really handy to be able to select/deselect lists for display in the live map. e.g. &quot;Show me the Brocklesby Hunt series list&quot; &quot;Show me my local caches list&quot; &quot;Show me just my To-Do favourites list&quot; &quot;Show me my lists for missing months for 2001 and 2002 for the Jasmer challenge&quot; From the live map, the user would hit the 'more' option, and an option to 'select lists'. A list of the user's available lists would be presented, with a checkbox against each. A global select all / select none checkbox would be available too. The user can select just those particular lists they are interested in viewing, and hit 'back'. Those caches not in the user's selected lists would be excluded from the map.

		c:geo is great for finding caches. But.. c:geo is not so great for placing new caches. We can check for proximity - Good, mostly. We can find out our current coordinates - Yes, but not so good. We can record and display our new placement - It's possible, but not good at all. Placing caches is something I find difficult in c:geo, and I revert to other apps and pencil/paper. Is this other side of caching something c:geo is aimed at? Should it be? It would be a lot of work to add features aimed at geocache placers, but it would give users more tie-in into this app by giving them less need to go elsewhere. Checking for proximity is catered for very well. This is something c:geo does nicely with the circles on the live map. Recording / averaging our current coordinate? That's a bit trickier. The best way I can find to get our current coordinate is to open up another cache somewhere else and try to add an extra waypoint to it. From there, I can see my current coordinate and ... jot it down on a piece of paper. OK, so I can add a waypoint onto that other cache to temporarily record my placement on the device, but that's such a faff. I have to remember roughly where it is to find it again, and which cache I stored it under (which might be miles away if I'm placing a cache in a virgin area), and then I have the maintenance fuss of deleting that waypoint and moving it somewhere more permanent - back to my pencil and sheet of paper. What would be a better way? A 'My Placements' area in c:geo dedicated to storing waypoints of potential hides. This area would effectively be a stored list of caches, but these would be a different class. These 'My Placements' caches would have no GC code, would have just a UID generated by the device, would have in their simplest form just an editable title and editable notes, and would appear on the live map, perhaps with a different icon to indicate they are one of your placements rather than a real cache. For placement of multi or puzzle caches, a single 'My Placements' cache could contain multiple waypoints. The live map would show proximity circles, just as with any other type of cache. Access to view the list of 'My Placements' could be through the 'stored' section, or through the main menu, but creation of a new 'My Placement' cache would be through the 'more' section of the live map. The user would select to create a new placement, and would be given their current coordinate and allowed to enter title and notes and perhaps select some attributes. The system would allow for coordinate averaging, storing multiple samples for a point over time.

		(Market version from 12/12/12) I had the global cache type filter set to show only &quot;Event Cache&quot;. I opened the live map, with the 'live' mode enabled. Lots of caches appeared with &quot;??&quot; markers, including many I know are traditionals. On opening one of them, the marker changed to the &quot;traditional&quot; marker with the smiley face and the floppy disk icon - it's one of the caches which is already in my &quot;stored&quot; list and already stored as &quot;found&quot;. As I understand it, the request to gc.com should have been asking for only event caches? More than just event caches were downloaded.

		A great thing with c:geo has always been the ability to test drive unpublished own caches. Now when I try to search for an unpublished cache's gc-code I get the message &quot;c:geo failed to load the cache details. The cache is unpublished&quot; Why is this restriction added?

Quand je rentre et passe en Wi-Fi ou en 3G y-a-t-il une possibilité pour les envoyer en un seul bloc, sans devoir les ouvrir une par une ? D'avance merci.

		There are some problems when checking/adjusting colors in the cache description. There is no handling of white fonts when using light skin. This gives this problem: The checks are for color=. This causes incorrect matches on bgcolor=. This is what causes this cache to get a gray background even though it doesn't have black text. To solve part 2, I first thought to change it to color= with a leading space, but this doesn't have to be true, so I am thinking about maybe stripping all bgcolor from the text before checking for color but I don't want to make a second copy of the entire text in memory again. Any feedback?

		Today on FB Tobias Andersson Hey and thanks for the awesome work you put in to this. However, I just upgraded to a Galaxy S4 and there is something wrong with the icons on the livemap. The little floppydisc that indicates that the cache is saved on the phone is about four times bigger and blurry as sh*t compared to how it looks on my S3. It is, of course, mostly an esthetical issue but it's kinda hard to see what type of cache it is when the floppyicon blocks out more than half the circle. :) Hopefully it's an easy fix (or maybe it's just something wrong with my phone, anyone else got this?) Tobias Andersson I suspect it got something to do with the higher resolution on the S4 but what do I know. Tobias Andersson Looked into it and it goes for all of the &quot;add-on&quot;-icons.

		This is entered for tracking purposes. If a BM does a Nearby search, then the distance is approximated as we don't have the cache coords. If a BM does a search by location, then the distance shown is in reference to where the search was done, not the user. Example: Go into Search Enter somewhere into the Address box and Search (I entered Hamburg) In the resulting list, the caches show as several hundred feet away instead of several thousand miles I'd suggest this limitation entered into the FAQ.

		This sounds like a strange request because why not add a waypoint? Well the reason is as follows. On multiple locations I have received coordinates in email, text, or even from OCRing a picture. I copy and paste the text into the 'personal note' of the cache. But now it does not become a waypoint. If the text was in the 'personal note' before (on the website) and it would load, it would have become a waypoint. So the easy request. Can we extract coordinates when entering the personal note in C:geo. this allow me to copy and paste a large number of coordinates at once using copy/paste and not have to make a lot of individual waypoints.

			<description>
		I searched for a similar request, but I couldn't find one. I would like to be able to see if a cache would need me to bring some tools (to climb, to dive, to swim, ...) when I look at the live map. Unfortunately the attributes of caches could not be used for this as not all caches are using attributes in the same way. (a climbing cache could miss the &quot;climbing required&quot; attribute although the description tells me to climb) Currently the best way to solve the problem is using several lists for each kind of tag I am using and then showing only this list in the live map. There are several downsides of this. (a cache can only have one tag at a time; caches from the normal live map can't be distinguished) Short term improvements: *A list could have a symbol. Each cache in the list would be displayed along with the symbol. *One could manually add tags to caches. An according symbol would make the tag visible in the live map. Long term improvements: *One could reuse the mechanism for a global filter system (issue #995) to use a filter result as dynamic tag. (a search could be combined like: attribute = &quot;climbing required&quot; OR owner = &quot;climbing only&quot; OR GC-Code = GC1234, GC5678) *Cache appearance (color, shape, symbol) could be determined by filters too. (Source = OC -&gt; shape quadratic; Terrain = T5 -&gt; color red) These are only my ideas of the topic. I would love to hear what you think of it.

		I am using nightly build 2013.06.14-NB-76f59b8 There has been a change in the waypoints are handled, and I vote to return it to the previous method. The change: long press on a waypoint takes a user straight to the edit screen. The problem: there is no means to navigate to the waypoint other than by the default means - the small compass icon on the waypoint view. In previous versions, a long press on the waypoint would provide the navigation menu, and options such as navigate(driving) would be availble. I cannot find a means to achieve this any more. Example: I have a puzzle cache with modified co-ordinates. When stored in c:geo, the original co-ordinates are also stored, and these can often be the parking place for access to the cache which I use to access my driving navigation application. It maybe related to this, but when a waypoint is selected on the map view, a menu -&gt; navigate also takes the user directly to the default navigation took (Radar in my case). Previously I was presented with the navigate selection menu. Please can I have it back :)

		When I click on the navigator link from any cache, the URL has 2 slashes after geocaching.com domain name, like http://www.geocaching.com//seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCxxxx This is not an issue unless you try to save personal note, since upload of note is not yet available from cgeo. In this case the page keep saying &quot;note is being saved&quot;. If I remove one of the two slashes saving is instantaneous.

		Hi, I have a big problem... I have a new mobile phone (Android Version 4.2.1, Kernel 3.4.5) and had to discover that the distance of a chosen cache in the compass view varies very much (i.e. 100m to &gt;10 km). The same happens if I view the list of saved caches on the phone... the caches wildly change their order in the menu.. very interesting to choose a cache... Also if I search for caches in the live map the scaling bar changes its scale new sometimes and switches back now and then... Changing the used maps does not help... (Thought it would help, but it doesn't and wrote that in a mail to the support)... Still- I do not see any such effects when using googlemaps directly and everything seems to be fine with the implemented GPS (no jumping in google maps or orux maps when tracking)... Help, please! :(

		Hello! My problem is, as stated in the title, that c:geo seems to use my phones gps even when it's closed. By default my gps tracking is switched off and I turn it on manually when I go GC hunting. When I've found what I've been looking for (using this great app), I turn off the gps tracking and close c:geo. However I've noticed that even after I've closed the app and turned gps tracking off it still seems to use the gps somehow. When I check the use details of c:geo under battery usage it shows that it still uses gps and drains battery accordingly. The gps usage time (and battery drain) won't stop until I've done a full phone restart, even force closing the app won't help, only restart. Anyone else having this issue (or is it an issue at all or am I doing something wrong)? I tried to search for similar topics, but couldn't find any. I'm new to c:geo, but I've found it to be a great app already, just hate to restart my phone after using c:geo just to conserve my battery. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I'm using c:geo (ver. 2013.06.05) on my galaxy nexus (android 4.2.2). Sorry if I'm in the wrong place with this, so feel free to redirect/delete/whatnot if so ;) Thanks, Runkha

			<description>
		I discovered this while working on #2234. Scroll to an area where you found many caches on the live map, and the outer ones will load as ?? caches because the details aren't important. If you click one, the pop-up loads some more details about it, but it loses track of the &quot;Found&quot; status on the cache. Now, if you close the pop-up, the smiley face indicating that the cache was found is missing. This also affects my fix for #2234; if you select a ?? cache which was found, and then click &quot;Hide own/found caches&quot;, that cache will not disappear with all the other ones. Clicking &quot;More Details&quot; in the pop-up (causing it to load that information again) will fix the problem. The cache status needs to be downloaded when clicking the pop-up, or the &quot;Found&quot; status needs to be kept somewhere. I'll try to fix this.

		It would appear that you can search for caches by name, code etc, but I was wondering if the search could include searching for caches by their difficulty or terrain rating. This way you will be able to find some of the harder to get types without having to spend ages searching online. Do you think this can be implemented in a future release, as I think it would be a great addition to the app.

The Problem will appear if the playstore-version gets an update. If that will be installed the app don't work. Always when I try to open the live-map the complete app force close. The only possibillity to change that is to install the newest nightly build over the website again. I tried to set the playstore not to update automatically but on days with much app-update I happen sometimes that I update it manually together with al the other apps. My suggestions: prevent the nightly to connect to the playstore! repair the force-close-bugs then the versions get accidentally installed that way? perhaps upload the nightly to the playstore as a seperate app if that don't make to much work?

		The talking compass function tells the direction to the cache in relation to the compass direction. You therefore have to point your smartphone to a specific direction such that the compass direction is a meaningful value, right? The direction output &quot;3 o'clock&quot; only makes sense if I hold the smartphone horizontally and with the upper side away from me. I would like to use the talking compass while keeping the smartphone in my pocket. This way I could approximate the cache without being noticed that I am a geocacher. I therefore suggest another direction mode which tells the bearing. Either in cardinal directions (north, north-east, east, ...) or with the pure value in degrees. This assumes that you have a slight notion on where 'north' is.

		I would like to have a easy way to control which caches are displayed on the (live) map. Now we have to go to the home screen -&gt; settings and loose the current viewed positions on the map. Implementing Issue #3078 &quot;Live map should start at last position if not fixed to current position&quot; would eliminate that effect but it is still a long way to the related settings. SIMPLE SOLUTION Add a &quot;Settings&quot; button to the menu of the map. That way we can reach the settings &quot;Exclude own and found caches&quot; and &quot;Exclude disabled caches&quot; more easier. EXTENDED SOLUTION Add a submenu &quot;View&quot; like &quot;Map View&quot; to The menu. It contains a list of check boxes which enables when marked the display of the related Caches. Some ideas for Options: Own and found Disabled Whit stored Log (Caches I couldn't find) All other (hide all so we can see the map in crowded areas) From which &quot;Stored&quot; lists (submenu, giving the option to select any combinations of lists - I don't want to see caches on my 'Riddels to solve online' list out in the field.) Type (maybe submenu) Difficulty (maybe submenu whit selection of which counts of stars) Alternative this menu could be called &quot;Filter&quot; and removers the selected kinds of cached from the map.

		This feature would alarm me when a new cache has been hidden in some predefined area via the normal android notification mechanisms. This is like a nearby search with sorting by hiding date, newest first. But executed automatically by the AlarmManager in predefined intervals. cgeo should store the last check time and only alert about caches hidden after this check time.

		I use „Radar“ (GPS Status 4.3.78) when approaching a cache. I notice the coordinates sent to that app are off by .001 in lon or lat direction for many caches. Examples: GC423BT, listed at N50° 47,654 and E 006° 04,212. When switching to Radar, target coordinates are N50° 47.654 (OK), but E 006° 04.211! Same for GC34TXF (N 50° 48,247 E 006° 04,622) targeted in Radar as N 50° 48.246, E 006° 4.622. I only noticed it in lon or lat component, never in both at the same time. Some caches are OK, like GC4DCZH. Build-in &quot;Kompass&quot; is OK, so i guess it has to do with sending the coordinates to GPS Status app, While the difference is small, in urban settings it can be crucial, and i start to reason about why i did not find so many caches during the last weeks. I did not notice that difference…

			<description>
		In case when more than one origin of caches is configurend (in my case GC.com und OC.de), there should be a possibility to filter for that property. So just display GC caches or OC caches or both.

		If you look at the map and see a couple of unsaved caches, you can choose to save them for offline, but it would be great to have the option to Update shown caches on the map (to se if some of them are archived and so on without to have to update them one by one)

		Helo, I have exported a set of caches to the GPX file, transported the file to another device and imported it to the c:geo again on the second device. But the caches does not contain the rating, popularity, inventory (TB) info etc. on the second device.

		When exporting cache GC32996 or GC2N3YV to the GPX, c:geo display message &quot;export failed&quot;. Actualy there is second issue with this. When exporting a lot of caches and c:geo display short message &quot;export failed&quot; somewhere in the middle. So it is not easy to find which cache caused the failure. It would be usefull to display also code or name of the cache in the message.

		I discovered that when I import .loc file I see whole time progress dialog for reading of file (process of importing caches is working, but progress is still showing 100% of reading a file, nothing about downloading caches from websites). http://i.imgur.com/Dbru1Bc.png This problem is present on android 4.0, ASUS FonePad. I don't know if elsewhere. If you can try I would like to know if I'm alone facing this issue or not.

		Hi i have two problems (sorry for my english). First: On active map instead of type of cache is displayed two question marks (?? - unknown type) until i open cache details. Saved caches are displayed corectly Second: Visited caches are displayed like unvisited even if filter is active. On the begining of using this app everything was OK it started about week ago.

		Hopefully I am clear enough with this request. There are trackable tags out there that have a QR printed on them. Some examples: http://shop.geocaching.com/default/trackable-items/travel-bugs/new-geocaching-qr-travel-bugr-black.html http://shop.geocaching.com/default/trackable-items/qr-tech-tags/qr-tech-tag.html The QR contains the url of the trackable page including the tracking code. Currently you can already scan these with any barcode scanning app and be taken to the trackable page within c:geo. What I am requesting though is to be able to scan these with the &quot;Geocode&quot; scanner that is already included within c:geo and be taken to the trackable page without ever having to leave the app. Currently the geocode scanner only supports cache pages using the userscript here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95134 I will also contact the author of the userscript to see if he can add QR to trackable pages also.

		When approaching a cache you usually use the map at first and then filp over to compass or radar when you are close to GZ. However you might frequently flip between them at GZ to account for the local topology (tracks, water, street sides, etc.). This should be achievable for the c:geo internally provided navigations such as map and compass (e.g. by an explicit separate button at the top or by an implict click area as I proposed it in PR #3427) but for externally provided navigations I have no approach in mind.

		When I clicked on &quot;nearby&quot; to see nearby caches, there is no way to filter only caches I didn't find. I see that I can filter to have pretty much everything else. I can use the map and I can see the caches with and without smiles, and I can pick from there, but it would be nice to have the the list filtered to &quot;didn't find&quot; only.

		In slovak translation, there´s an attribute: &quot;dogs allowed&quot;. In slovak language it is translated as &quot;psi povolené&quot; and that should be &quot;psy povolené&quot;. Also I would like to mark my own caches as found so I can easily sort them on my phone, because I don´t normally find my own caches. It could be as a setting. Thanks, c:geo is a great app!

		There is an option to remove past events but to remove all found caches an user has to sort them to have found on the top, tick all found and remove chosen, so three steps. An option to remove all found would do that in one step. The most important is that this option should remove only found and logged online (green color), not found and logged offline (orange color).

		On Navigate menu, there are already some options for navigation that are shown only if specific application is installed, for example OruxMaps. Could you please add another option, the &quot;Pebble watch&quot;? The application for pebble and android app are already usable. They are available on the following link: https://github.com/WebMajstr-/pebble-cgeo In near future they will be also added to Google Play store and Pebble store that will presumably start in next weeks. Additionally, I've also prepared the code for C:Geo that communicates with Pebble app and should be inserted in cgeo.geocaching.apps.cache.navi package, so implementing this change should be really fast for you :) package cgeo.geocaching.apps.cache.navi;

import cgeo.geocaching.Geocache;
import cgeo.geocaching.R;
import cgeo.geocaching.geopoint.Geopoint;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.Intent;

class PebbleApp extends AbstractPointNavigationApp {

    private static final String INTENT = &quot;com.webmajstr.pebble_gc.NAVIGATE_TO&quot;;
    private static final String PACKAGE_NAME = &quot;com.webmajstr.pebble_gc&quot;;

    PebbleApp() {
        super(getString(R.string.cache_menu_pebble), R.id.cache_app_pebble, INTENT, PACKAGE_NAME);
    }

    @Override
    public void navigate(Activity activity, Geopoint point) {
        final Intent pebbleIntent = new Intent(INTENT);
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;latitude&quot;, point.getLatitude());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;longitude&quot;, point.getLongitude());
        activity.startActivity(pebbleIntent);
    }

    @Override
    public void navigate(Activity activity, Geocache cache) {
        final Intent pebbleIntent = new Intent(INTENT);
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;latitude&quot;, cache.getCoords().getLatitude());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;longitude&quot;, cache.getCoords().getLongitude());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;difficulty&quot;, cache.getDifficulty());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;terrain&quot;, cache.getTerrain());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;name&quot;, cache.getName());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;code&quot;, cache.getGeocode());
        pebbleIntent.putExtra(&quot;size&quot;, cache.getSize().getL10n());
        activity.startActivity(pebbleIntent);

		Hi, sometimes I'm facing problem, that I log via field notes from computer and in that case I have caches not found in c:geo to get it to actual state it is needed to update caches, but it take some time and wastes gc.com servers. What about function which can update just Found/DNF/Attended ... from this url: http://www.geocaching.com/my/logs.aspx?s=1 ? It can download just one page for this purpose, which is much more acceptable than refreshing all caches. The only problem is that on that page we have name of cache and GUID, but not GC code.

		In settings &gt; system it's possible to move the database to the sd-card. But that don't work right on my Sony Xperia V. When I use that function the data gets moved from phone-storage to internal-storage instead of external sd-card. It would be very helpful if it would be possible to choose the right storage.

		This was already reported by Ticketautomat and issue is closed - but not solved. I am annoyed about the language setting of my account in gc.com is so often switched to English. I wrote to GC about it. Their answer was a question: Do I use some other application that uses the gc account? Of course I do - c:geo. Now I made some tests: C:geo is off. Then several log-ins and log-outs on gc homepage. Language stayed always German (fine). One log-in with c:geo, then next log-in on gc homepage shows language setting changed to English (bad). This is reproducable. I don't even have to log-out and re-log-in on the web site to see this language change. It is sufficient to start c:geo and then press F5 (refresh) in my PC web browser to see the language change to English. Either the app does the language switch or the gc api does it implicitly in the backend when it is used by c:geo. Please help.

		Hi, I'm using IntelliJ IDEA (which Android Studio is based on) for Android development. I would like to add a project file (*.iml file) to the repository and ignore workspace specific settings (like which device to use). The main reason is, that I can't commit those changes in my forked project without including them in my pull requests (or can I?). So either I don't commit those changes or I delete this commit before each pull request - both are a little bit annoying. Furthermore, with Google switching from Eclipse to Android Studio it is just a matter of time for other software developers to follow.

		In the latest release the option to navigate using &quot;MapsWithMe&quot; has been added. On my device, selecting MapsWithMe from the navigate menu pops-up an option to install MapsWithMe even though it's already installed on my system. Clicking on one of those options takes me to the GooglePlayStore page for MapsWithMe. I suspect the problem is because I didn't purchase MapsWithMe from GooglePlayStore, I bought it from AndroidPit on a special offer. There is a workaround: if I select &quot;Ext. map&quot; from the Navigate menu, one of the options is MapsWithMe and if I select it there it works fine.

		I found the faq to make the change. However I can not find a main menu / settings or appearance. Nor has it changed automatically. It was fine on my old Motorola phone, but now I have a Samsung Galaxy S 5. How can I change to imperial units ? c:geo uses metric units by default but should be able to detect if you are using a local setting which defaults to imperial units and will adapt to it automatically. A manual change can be done in c:geo settings (main screen, Press menu, Select settings, Select Appearance) and select &quot;Use Imperial units&quot;.

		I have just been looking at the code for the &quot;edit destination&quot; menu of the compass. That does nothing than just invoke the &quot;Any edit&quot; activity and cancel the compass activity itself. To me that is confusing (as the compass is gone afterwards) and is basically not related to the compass at all. I suggest to remove this menu, especially as there is still the &quot;select destination&quot; menu item, which allows to select one of the waypoints of the cache as destination. Comments?

		Having used this fantastic app on about 5 different android phones, it seems there is some issue with the compass on the Nexus 5. I have a number of other apps that use the compass, and they give correct and consistent readings. I find that, in particular, when far away from the coords, say 20+ meters, cgeo's compass just isn't working.

		I was just trying to fix #4036 by just making the URL part of the regex more tolerant. That worked fine, but afterwards by emulator was hanging for eternity when trying to download the avatar image. I guess this is because of the toBlocking() in HtmlImage.getDrawable(). Generally speaking, right now the image CDN of GC.com is somewhat broken as it seems (it creates direct links instead of using the CDN, and the https links deliver http traffic). Nevertheless we should not have such blocking calls with a time limit.

It's not really an issue with the app, but I wasn't sure where to ask this question. I think anyone new to the dev team will have this problem.

		I wish to have a mode, where c:geo shows every cache one or more members of the current group did not find yet. The Problem ist, you often go caching with a group of people which do not have found the same caches, but only one or two are using there devices, to save battery. Sometimes you walk past a cache some members would like to log, but nobody knows there is a cache they need. Maybe you can &quot;connect&quot; accounts by scanning a QR-Code from another device and c:geo only hides the finds of all members currently connected. It would be an awesome feature of an already great app!

Not to the extent of having a LCARS theme but something comical when we're the dead centre of attention. Tricoder sound example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_LV_mUd14

Pack each Adapter into an DEX file Dynamic load DEX file's from an location Allow user to add new connectors This would allow to build new connectors more easy. You can provide &quot;binary&quot; plugins for GC-API without disclosure of the source. Less dependencies in the project.

		For mystery and multi caches it is possible to change the cache coordinates. E.g. after I've solved a mystery, I set the coordinates of the cache to the coordinates of the final. This allows me to see on the maps the place I need to walk to. For traditional caches this is not possible. This is correct, as the cache location is the place I will visit. For WherIGo caches it is not possible as well. Usually I will start at the given coordinates. But especially in the case of Play-Anywhere-WherIGos, I'm getting the coordinates of a final box during the game. Now I would be happy if I can set the coordinates of the cache. I'll be happy if you implement this change. btw: Thanks a lot for your work and keep on hacking

		I created child waypoints in GSAK, and then export as a GPX file to Dropbox, and then import into c.geo. However, the child waypoints don't show up as additional waypoints. If I import the GPX file to another program on my PC, or even if I import the file to Locus, the child waypoints are correctly shown. So only c.geo is not importing them correctly. My preferred app is c.geo, so hoping you have a fix. Thx

			<bugID>Issue #4476</bugID>
			<label>None yet</label>
			<description>
		Hi, If I am not mistaken, currently the Google Maps integration in c:geo does not cache map tiles? I know I can use OSM maps to have offline maps, but these have some points that could be considered sub-optimal: You have to either store complete countries in your phone, or create your own maps for the areas you need. For example the map for Germany is 1.3GB. In some countries Google Maps is just a lot better compared to OSM. Would you consider implementing support for the caching of Google Maps tiles? By caching I mean caching them for a couple of day or so. I think the Google Maps API v2 (#2222) supports storing tiles offline and allows to keep tiles stored for up to 30 days? In a perfect world, we would be using the offline storage of the official Android Google Maps app. This app can store maps offline in a convenient way: all zoom levels are stored. So when preparing for a trip, or for areas you frequently visit, you keep the maps stored offline in Google Maps. If c:geo could use this, it would be very helpful. I've tried to google whether this is possible, but couldn't really find any info on it. I would be willing to help on the implementation, but first we need to agree on whether it's a desired feature, etc. Opper

		I love c:geo - have been using it ever since I got a smartphone, but I've recently encountered a rather annoying issue. The compass no longer works. The distance to the cache updates fine, but the compass does not function properly. It seems to only want to bounce between 2 different headings (between 0-30 degrees and between 180-210 degrees). This only became an issue within the past few weeks; I'm not sure if it was after an update or not. I check the compass in other apps, and it works fine elsewhere. I've also tried it both using GPS and compass and GPS only, and neither one works. Is there something I can do to fix this issue? I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app with the same issue still present. I use a Samsung Galaxy S3 (SPH-L710) running Android version 4.4.2

Depending on the zoom level, some portions are not displayed. I'm using offline map downloaded from mapsforge website, suggested in c:geo's FAQ. I don't know if the problem is with the c:geo or with the map. It's up to you to check it :} This bug is also present in one of my friends phone. You can find attached a screenshot how it looks.

Even if I refresh all stored caches, the images is still missing. If I refresh the cache itself, the image appears. But it is stored only temporarily. If I leave cache details, go back to the map and select the cache again and lick on &quot;More details&quot; the image is missing. I hope you can fix it as soon as possible, because I had some bad lucks with it, being in a zone where there was no mobile internet and the only hint was that photo. Best regards, kukukk

		I'm currently working on a project to create maps from an amalgamation of data (OSM, OS, shapefiles). These are processed to generate a single OSM file which I am then processing with Osmosis and mapsforge mapfile-writer to generate .map file to be viewed on various Android apps. These maps almost always work on all the maps and apps I've tested (Atlas application on Windows and Locus/Orux/cgeo on Android). I have one map which causes a crash when I try to load it in cgeo on both my tablet and my phone. Other than looking at the log file and asking here is there any easy way to find what might be causing the problem? I've tested maybe 5 other maps (almost all covering larger areas and one much larger one which includes the area causing the fault) and they all work fine. I've uploaded 2 maps to Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/chaxjx4oxtjs9ih/AACf9g0wNcRgCOB5n4IaMWDOa?dl=0) OS_NU_android crashes and OS_TEST_android (which is a subset of it) doesn't.

			<description>
		I know that one can save caches for offline use and that there's a list of what I logged, but there should be a list of recently opened caches, just like it is on geocache.com profile main page. It would be very helpful for a typical usage scenario where I visit several caches but don't want to fiddle around with the smartphone for writing the log text, but log at home in peace and comfortably. And for that I'd need a view of the visited caches in the order of opening. I assume it should be quite easy to implement, there would be no need to synchronize with the geocache.com list, but only store locally in c:geo the last x caches which were opened in detail.

		Does c:geo support receiving outside intents with coordinates as extras, to start a new waypoint / open the compass with those coordinates? I'm very new to the android programming scene and due to lack of experience cant yet grasp your source code just by looking at it. I'm working on an application that has an option to share coordinates and i would love to give the users an option to open them on c:geo. If this is possible, i hope you can point me to the right intent + class name.

		If I make offline logs during a geocacheing session, I can't see them in c:geo. Only on the map, when i scroll to the position of the cache, the cache with the red smiley is shown.

		The actual implementation of the NextPageGeocacheListLoader doesn't use parallelCombineActive. In case of multiple connectors supporting loading next page calls will be parallelized. (However, as of today we only have GC connetor supporting this). This will be necessary for #4802. The &quot;load more cache&quot; function should call parallelCombineActive, as retrieving Generic Trackable will be hooked there.

		Hi, I left the following message to the geocaching.com site: &quot;How can I store my user interface language more permanently. Apparently, this option uses cookies to store language? I don't want to store cookies permanently, because I also use public computers. If I close browser and logged in again, the user interface language setting is returned back to original.&quot; ..and geocaching.com answer: &quot;Hello, Thank you for contacting Geocaching HQ. Do you use the Android app c:geo? There is a bug currently in the app that is reverting your language settings back to English on our website. Since this is third party website, we have no control over fixing it. You will have to reach out to c:geo for additional support. Please let us know if you have further questions. Kindly, Janelle Geocaching Community Manager&quot;

		It would be good if you all offline logs that written without an internet connection, can be transfer with once command. If you select this point, I can see the cache and the log again, before I executing then this command. This function could be accommodated in the menu with the three dots on the main screen.

		My normal mode of operation for using c:geo is as follows: Use the map to find my area of interest. Scale the map to select an appropriate number of caches and store offline. Peruse the list for caches to target. Open the cache details Go to the logs and look at the recent ones to see when it was last found This is because where I live it isn't uncommon for a cache to go unfound for months and often the last years worth of logs are DNFs and/or needs maintenance. I usually will just skip these. It would be nice to have some sort of indication on the list page and/or the first details page of the last time cache was found and/or what the type of the last few logs are. My initial spit-ball of an implementation would be to have a colored/dashed line duplicating the colors from the last few log entries on the list page, one log per dash. Then that could be duplicated along with a last found date on the details page.

		I suggest a &quot;Toggle&quot; (by pressing on the the text itself), between the approximate date and the actual date of &quot;stored in device&quot;. This way the current functionality is also preserved. Detail: I use my &quot;Stored in Device&quot; date as a way of knowing when I actually &quot;found&quot; the cache. (which I then log from the geocaching.com website) I do this together with putting the cache into a &quot;Found&quot; List. So displaying the date, instead of the approximation, would be invaluable for me, so I don't have to figure out which day I was at the cache location.

		Thanks for the app! Recently, I was thinking about a new feature. Usually, I save the geocaches for one city before I go for hunting. After a while, many caches are in a list and many of them I saved weeks ago. It would be nice have a button to reload all saved geocaches and make the description up-to-date. At the moment, you have to click on each individually to update them.

		Yesterday it was cold (~0°C and windy). Since I don't have gloves for touchscreen use I got cold fingers while using cgeo - I don't like cold fingers. So thinking about how it could be possible to use cgeo with gloves the motion sensor came into my mind: For CacheDetailView: tend to the left / right ^= wipe to the left / right tend to the top / bottom ^= scroll up / down For Map: maybe we can add crosshairs which can be moved by tending the phone. to select fast move forward and back. But this can also be added later. For Lists / mainmenu: highlight the current selected item. move selection by tending the phone. select in the same way like map-select. Back: fast move left / right.

		When tapping on the owner name in the cache listing view, you can already call by context menu the Groundspeak web site to send a private message to the cache owner. While running with bad internet connection throw the forest and not liking to load a web page first, it would be nice to be able to type in the message content directly in the c:geo app and the app will automatically send it via Groundspeak to the owner. Also nice then, if the app will show a prefilled edit box with {cache owner name}, {cache name}, {GC code} and {my nick name} in the following format: Hello {cache owner name}, “{cache name}” ({GC code}). Regards, {my nick name} So you can directly post your concerns, without coping or typing boring standard content.

		I suggest we exclude the dedicated website tests (where each connector is tested one time) from normal unit testing. Benefit: Continuous integration testing on code changes is not affected by websites being down (e.g. OC.es right now). Drawback: We might take longer to notice parser issues after website changes, depending on how often we look at failing website tests.

		Developers of c:geo, I have found that AsyncTask.execute has been widely used in the project. However, this API is relatively slower on devices with system version higher than 3.0 because &quot; AsyncTasks were executed serially on a single background thread&quot; for systems newer than 3.0. (This is found in the API guide) While using c:geo, users can easily trigger multiple AsyncTasks and influence the performance, so I think it will help to improve the performance by changing execute to executeOnExecutor to enable real multi-thread execution. Thanks a lot.

		Just found out that despite c:geo has offline maps support, it doesn't work with native maps.me maps which are in .mwm format. Steps: Install maps.me download some areas for offline use make sure they were downloaded in .mwm run c:geo, point to the folder with downloaded map files make sure no new maps were added to c:geo It really makes sense, because it's the default use case - download some maps from the mobile maps app and then use it in c:geo.

		I know you are not the mapsforge support team, but you have the &quot;Offline Maps&quot; feature, which I use very often (especially abroad), so I think I'll ask here. I figured out a long time ago where to get the maps, but I still struggle on how to apply Themes to those maps. There are pages that provide mapsforge themes, but I got them never to work in c:geo. Is there a source for these themes or could you at least include a few more themes? Mapsforge (v0.6.1) does not include any other built-in themes than the default. I don't know how many users actually use this feature, but I think it would be more users if the feature was more &quot;accessible&quot;. Some of the pages that give themes for free: http://www.openandromaps.org/en/legend/elevate-mountain-hike-theme http://openmaps.eu/mapsforgetheme Sidenote: I also found the thread (mentioned in the help here: http://www.cgeo.org/faq.html#osm-use-themes) where user @Lineflyer asks if he could use a theme, but most of the links seem to be dead: http://forum.locusmap.eu/index.php?topic=1753.0

Updated to 13 this week (clear install with wipe) and re-installed all apps from playstore. They all work fine but not c:geo. Reinstalled both the OS and c:geo but it still crashes while other apps (e.g. Locus) work fine.

		I was just approached with the following request: In the logging activity menu the menu items for saving the log and for deleting the log are directly besides each other, therefore leading to frustrating when hitting the deletion menu item unintendedly. I'll add undo to the log deletion operation, to take the pressure out of this. I still suggest to actually remove the &quot;store log offline&quot; item, since we store the log anyway when exiting the activity. Thoughts on that?

		When using a longer route then it is not displayed in high zoom levels. I guess the path is simply to huge in it's full pixel bounding box. Therefore we need to clip the path. Haven't found a suitable clipping method yet, will probably remove all out of bounding box segments manually instead.

		The various challenges people set themselves or take up from challenge caches often drive people to seek out caches that would help satisfy the challenge If you look on project-gc.com you can see various grids and cache attributes and it's quite common for particularly nerdy cachers to want to collect all the boxes of those grids. Two of the most common are a) Filling all of the DT grid -- i.e. all 81 combinations of difficulty and terrain. Oncepl filled people look to repeat the cycle, i.e. fill it with numbers &gt;= 2 and so on. b) filling the &quot;Caches by hidden month&quot; grid. The challenge caches for this are named after the person who first invented them &quot;Jasmer&quot;. So you frequently see people talking about finding &quot;Jasmers&quot;. I maintain a list called &quot;Jasmer&quot; which has any caches in areas I'm interested in that were hidden in a month that I'm currently missing on my Jasmer grid. However this has several problems. a) I can't store all the caches around the world this way so when I go to a new area I need to add more even if I'm not planning to do much caching and expecting to have data b) it's really hard to remove caches when I fill a spot. Removing dozens of caches from a lit based on an attribute that doesn't show in the listing is laborious and error prone and some of them may still be worth storing for other reasons but some may have had no other reason to be on the phone. What I would suggest instead is to keep an internal representation of the Jasmer grid and DT grid -- they're very small and easy to fetch from geocaching.com and/or project-gc but also fairly easy to just construct and update from stored information too. Then display an icon or word on the listing and on the cache detail page if the cache fits the property. It would be neat to provide a virtual list for these properties too which would display all stored caches that have the property. Then my workflow for most areas would be &quot;store all caches in the area&quot; then &quot;display virtual list jasmer&quot; choose my destinations based on that and then look at all stored caches in those areas.

		Use Case: Base Members cannot add PMO caches to lists. On the other hand, BMs are allowed to log and sometimes have access to PMO listings, e.g. through a Premium Member colleague. Phase 1 could be to create a cache entry by entering GCCode, Name and Coords manually. Later some details could be retrieved automatically, e.g. owner, D/T rating. One way to get this information is nearby search. Currently the only way to enter PMO coordinates is to add a reference point to an already existing different cache.

		Follow up from #6186 (comment). It turned out that due to the lack of foreign keys in the DB it happens that geocaches got deleted from cg_caches without their related records in dependent tables like cg_logs, cg_waypoints, ... The DataStore.cleanIfNeeded() is the housekeeping method which regulary (on startup) cleans up the database. This should be extended to also clean up these orphaned records as well.

		I just swithed from WM10 where I was using maaloo geocaching. While I'm really impressed with all the features has, there is one I'm already missing very much. Like stated in the subiect, it woild be great to be able to create a waypoint by just taping and holding on the map. Use case: I view the cache I want to drive to and it doesn't have a parking waypoint. In the map view I can see an OSM marked parking near by (or any other object that could serve as a parking spot). I tap and hold on that spot and a &quot;pin&quot; or createn wew WPT menu appears From that menu I can either save it or select &quot;Navigate&quot; option (which I can use to pass the location e.g. to Google maps. I consider this feature useful because sometimes suitable parking places aren't always on the road closest to the target (therefore the navigation might not lead you to them if you navigate to the cache coordinates). Also, in an unfamiliar country it is best to be navigated straight to the parking as different signs and markings already add to the confusion. Regards WW

The question is stupid simple - how do you select which features to implement next (except bugfixing and some maintenance stuff)? Just decide witchin the evening chat in IRC? Or do you have some kinda voting for new features? Except implementing it by my own, is there some possibility to increase chance of being implemented for features I'm (and other users) interested in?

			<description>
		Dear developers, We are applying our performance diagnosis tool PerfProbe to debug the response time for searching for nearby cache given a same address. Through repeated testing in an identical setup, we observe intermittent slowdown for the search result to be displayed (response time on average around 3.6 seconds and can increase to over 7 seconds). Through its system-wide profiling and tracing, PerfProbe discovers that the source of extra delay results from longer waiting time for server-side response. In particular, cgeo app is waiting for the response of two sequential HTTP GET request - one by GCLogin.getRequestLogged inside the method GCParser.searchByAny and another by GCVote.loadRatings inside the method SearchResult.filterSearchResults (with the detailed call chain CoordsGeocacheListLoader.apply -&gt; GCConnector.searchByCenter -&gt; GCParser.searchByCoords -&gt; GCParser.searchByAny -&gt; SearchResult.filterSearchResults). We hope the findings from our tool can be helpful for your debugging. We are also interested in helping improving the performance of this interaction. One suggestion to improve the latency that we can come up with is to batch the two HTTP requests in one network round trip - parallel HTTP request if they have no dependency or otherwise combine the response information of two requests together such that one new HTTP request is sufficient. Thank you very much for your attention and clarification! Detailed steps causing the problem: Step 1: click &quot;Search&quot; Step 2: enter address information under &quot;Address&quot; Step 3: click &quot;Search by address&quot; Actual behavior after performing these steps: Intermittently longer waiting time for the list of nearby geo caches to be loaded Expected behavior after performing these steps: A list of nearby geo caches are loaded Version of c:geo used: 2017.03.29 Is the problem reproducible for you?

			<description>
		I've noticed a styling problem in the cache list. Caches that have a color marker on the left (found, etc) have the following differences from caches without this marker: cache icon is larger. (AFAIK cache icon is composed from multiple images, that of the cache type, that of the found, that of having waypoints) text is offset to right with the width of the border-left and a padding-left (without marker, there is no spacing for the marker width and padding-left=0) This creates a visually disturbing zig-zag effect. IMO cache type icons (with or without composition) should be the same size and the contents of the first column should be aligned at a constant position, leaving space for that marker where it is missing.

		#6715, #6816 and #6821 are all addressing the calculator notes issue and all were closed before I was able to be involved with the changes, so I thought it would be best to open an issue of my own to provide input. As it stands the 'calculator notes' have been removed from the 'calculators state' but seem to be tagged onto the state externally with an 'ImmutablePair' object. In my mind if the notes field is essentially intended to be independent of the calculator itself it would be better to simply access the Waypoint's note data directly than tag it onto the calculator's state and kind of 'carry' them around together. I have an implementation of this and are mainly creating this issue so as to have a branch in which to commit this implementation.

		Detailed steps causing the problem: Add a new waypoint There are two editable areas &quot;Note&quot; and &quot;User Note&quot; Actual behavior after performing these steps: Two areas where one is enough. Expected behavior after performing these steps: &quot;Note&quot; area which is usually read-only for imported waypoints is not visible because it makes no sense for user created waypoints. Version of c:geo used: 2017.11.05-NB-cc9328b Is the problem reproducible for you? Yes System information: On demand. Other comments and remarks: Not sure if this was always the case.

		While using the waypoint calculator I wondered how I can share the variables gathered from stage to stage among the waypoints for easy transfer in the calculator formulas. My idea was to create a virtual waypoint called &quot;Variables&quot; to collect all stage variables in its user notes. From there I wanted to copy them into the stages' user notes. The user notes are also visible in the calculator so they can be copied in the variable values of the waypoint calculator. In the following screenshot you can see virtual waypoint &quot;Variables&quot; from where the variables were copied into the waypoints &quot;Stage 2&quot; and &quot;Stage 4&quot;. Unfortunately there is no way to copy the user notes from a waypoint. 😮 I did a rough implementation that creates a new waypoint action &quot;Copy Notes&quot;. This action strips HTML from the waypoint note, merges with user note and copies both into clipboard. Before I continue on the code I just wanted to ask in advance if there is interest and a chance to get this feature included.

		Same as #5498 but for other actions like &quot;Caches around&quot;. This somehow slipped through because I thought that &quot;Nearby&quot; action is the same as &quot;Caches around&quot;. Only the way how the start coordinates are determined is different. But in fact, there are two different loader types: CacheListType.NEAREST (fixed in #5498) CacheListType.COORDINATE (still truncates list to 40) Fix should be trivial. I will handle it.

		See formuia in GC7ENZJ. North 48° ((B * D) +((D+E+A+B+C+F+G+H) * C)) *A East 011° (E+D) * A * B Result of both formulas is something like 23456. There is no possibility to &quot;float-divide&quot; by 1000 to get 23.456. The only way to achieve the desired result is to repeat both formulas once with &quot;/ 1000&quot; and once with &quot;% 1000&quot;, e.g. in plain mode: N 48° (((B*D) + ((D+E+A+B+C+F+G+H)*C)) * A / 1000).(((B*D) + ((D+E+A+B+C+F+G+H)*C)) * A % 1000) E 011° ((E+D) * A * B / 1000).((E+D) * A * B % 1000) Needless to say that this is cumbersome.
