            <review_title>Been using this for years and still love it</review_title>
            <review_text>My only issue is when your list is long enough to scroll hitting the 3 dots on the right to update a series can be an exercise in frustration as it often detects it as a tap of the scroll bar instead of a tap of the item causing it to jump around.</review_text>

            <review_title>I don't know that it's a bug or not.....</review_title>
            <review_text>Whenever I disable this app (for hiding purposes) and then enable it .....it asks me to login again.....and it's kind of tiring for someone who can't remember passwords(like me).....and many times I have to change my password to a new one..... If it's a normal behavior for the app then please ignore..... I will just try to learn my password....lol......Other than that....it's a very good app.....delivers more than what it promises....I like it a lot...;!</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is pretty useful ! I use it everyday. It will be good to have possibility to sort completed animes by start or finish date. (Reply : but it's possible on our MAL list). Even when update dates automatically is disabled, the app often replace the dates with the current day, so we lose our data, please fix it ! It seems the app sometimes forget to send dates.</review_text>

            <review_title>Hi there.</review_title>
            <review_text>I use MAL. Today, I opened the app to update my list but then the Manga List wouldn't show anything. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Still nothing. I synced it a couple of times too. Still blank. The only thing affected is my Manga List. The Anime List is working just fine. I have a very stable internet connection too. Could you please help me find the problem? Thanks so much. :)</review_text>

            <review_text>UPDATE: I only that it needs something but I'll try. Well, for starters, when you open the app it looks kind of plain. Maybe put it in some blurred artworks. And in the browse section of Anilist, instead of clicking 'Filter', how bout swipe function. Maybe some settings for us to change the apps or our list inside the swipe function. Hope this helps</review_text>

            <review_title>Progressing! (Bug Report)</review_title>
            <review_text>When I add (+) an anime to my list and slide down to refresh the anime's page, it resets to its initial state, so it'd be good to use the slide down event to save besides the 'back' click.. button whatever. Nonetheless great app! EDIT: I'm aware of the HTTPS switch MAL did and I was worried it might cause some problems, but it seems that you're handling everything perfectly, thanks again.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really like how this app is designed and does almost everything i want it to. If i had one suggestion it would be that the relationship info that shows ova would also link to the source material such as the manga it is adapted from as it does on the main myanimelist page.</review_text>

            <review_text>Updated to current version,and the first time I started it, it crashed. The second time I tried, it sent me to login. I'm confused as to why, since my other apps have never asked me to login again after the initial setup. To end this on a good note, Progress updates on series is a lot faster now. Using Anilist.</review_text>

            <review_text>every update gets the app better and better. Nice UI and very reliable in terms of details. My only suggestion is the I can make a review for a certain anime, straight from the app itself. A great app all in all.</review_text>

            <review_title>Awesome</review_title>
            <review_text>Well it just works. Simple interface and pretty much all MAL features that I use. Nice touch that it puts the dates when I started watching something and when I finished, thou sometimes it fails.</review_text>

            <review_text>If I view popular or rated anime list, there's 'watch episode...' or 'watch promotional...' after the anime review_title. For example the review_title became 'Gintama°Watch Episode Video'. Not really matter that much to me but maybe I should tell you guys.</review_text>

            <review_text>Everything fine and the Forum tab is the exact same thing as the MAL site, and that impresses me the most. The only thing that I want to improve upon this amazing APP is it's SPEED itself. Syncing the data takes quite a while, I hope you can do something about that. Well, all in all... this is such a great MAL client!</review_text>

            <review_text>I installed this software and it was only a list management app, exactly like it clearly says! I demand it meet my clearly unreasonable expectations of watching the anime for me! How dare you release something that doesn't do what you don't say it will! Seriously though, I'm giving it 5 stars just to balance out the idiots that can't read before making demands for free anime. The app itself works pretty much exactly as you would expect a MAL client to do, so it probably deserves the 5 anyway. Also, turns out it only dislikes a couple of special characters, not all.</review_text>

            <review_text>When I went into the app, this is the first thing I saw : which site do you prefer  My anime list / Anilist. The next thing I saw was written in red ! You cannot watch anime or read manga. Read the first line in the store description ! I was confused then chose my anime list. It came out somebody had used my gmail account for their own personal use and when I chose create account, it suddenly went to a website ! And I can't believe I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to use this app.</review_text>

            <review_text>Great app, very useful. Only issue I have is the personal info page, it seems like sometimes it ignores the info I put in, even on the latest version. Maybe consider having a discrete update info button at the bottom of the page? It would be useful, cause I'm not really sure when/if my change is getting saved to server.</review_text>

            <review_title>Could Be Better</review_title>
            <review_text>Aside from the minor negative of the Holo-esque sliding tabs, the app just needs to create more efficient use of space. The anime pages are fragmented into multiple tabs, with little information displayed. The general Material Design elements are very much appreciated, but there is further work to be done in that regard. (*nudge* You could add an option for light cards for the main pages! *wink*) Nonetheless, it's a good MAL client!</review_text>

            <review_text>The only problem I have is that it's not showing things I'm rewatching. Like SnK is under completed instead of in progress. I've only ever used the MAL app on my iPod bc the one for Android was too different but this is almost better so far. And TAGS omg there are no tags and I live for them! I keep all my thoughts and junk there!</review_text>

            <review_text>Nice, clean and simple MAL client. Something Dreadful has created Something Awesome. Sync is fast for me, (wifi, 40mbit), no startup issues on Android 5.0.2. Only one suggestion so far: Add a +1 button to the anime tile instead of in a submenu, and change the sub menu button for +1 to the dialogue to change the watch count and status. In my case, as I update MAL not every watched EP i'd have to tap+slide trough roughly 5 screens to get to the watch status and EP count, which IMO should be easier to reach. Also, maybe a feature request system in-app with a list of requests and request progress if being worked on, and a vote system could help for either only the beta, or both beta and release version.</review_text>

            <review_text>Awesome conversion of MAL in an app. I can update my progress of anime and manga conveniently and without the hassle of updating it through a web browser on my mobile device or on my computer later. I do hope though that a later update will add the function to search through genres. Best MAL out there. Looking forward to more updates.</review_text>

            <review_text>My complaint is that it keeps scrolling up or down because it thinks I'm hitting the scroll bar and not the menu button for updating the chapter I'm on. Maybe move the button over a bit more or move the scroll bar to the left side? The problem continues to be a severe annoyance every time I want to update a series. Please make the buttons either bigger or move them to the other side. I have skinny fingers and this still happens ALL the time. GalaxyS5</review_text>

            <review_text>I'm running into the same bugs as derek chan where my anime list shows instead of the manga list. Seems to consistently happen if I view an anime or manga's details by tapping on it in my list and then go back to my list. Also happens if I go to my phone's home screen and reopen the app from my recent apps list. I'm running KitKat on a Maxx HD. I hope this help you track down the bug.</review_text>

            <review_text>As someone who's loved the UI even when there was no search feature, I'm liking everything you guys are doing with the app. However, with the major update I'm feeling a little empty now that I can't see the numbers when I rate things. Keep up the good work!</review_text>

            <review_text>I love the new design! There's one thing that I wish was different. I think it would be more intuitive to switch the list change button and the tabs for Anime/Manga. Having Watching, Planned, etc. on the tabs would keep the user within the same category instead of switching Anime or Manga lists.</review_text>

            <review_text>It used to work perfectly fine until the crashing became a huge problem. Whenever I try to edit my completed or on hold list, it crashes continously. Now I can't even edit my current readings without it crashing. I have tried to uninstall and install again but it wouldn't allow me to login. It says hold on a few sec &amp; I'm stuck at the loading page, unable to move forward.</review_text>

            <review_text>It was working fine..until a few minutes ago. It crashes often yes, but I could've dealt with it. But it won't let me search any anime or manga, when I search it says No anime or manga exists. Either the API server is broken, or you can't spell. Something like that. And clearly the animes I search exist.. This was a good app to use too, what a shame.</review_text>

            <review_text>*updated review* Wow a massive improvement, ill use this app as my main MAL driver for now, as other apps are having sync problems, this app sync perfectly and runs relatively quick, runs very quickly on my nexus 7 (2013) a little slower on my galaxy s3 but the hardware is old so I can't l blame it. The only down side is lack of editing options like review_texts and priority which is available on the MAL website itself and some of the other apps. Will give it a perfect score when those options are out.</review_text>

            <review_title>Excellent apps!!</review_title>
            <review_text>This app is great over all but it still need a bit of improvement. Please add the ability to edit the starting/ending date for anime entries. That's would have made this app to be one of the best MAL apps in the play store.</review_text>

            <review_title>Almost perfect.</review_title>
            <review_text>I really love this app, and after trying out several other MAL android apps this is definitely the one for me. It's contemporary and stylish, easy to understand too. The only thing that prevents me from perfectly is that it can be very bugged at times. The current bug is the FCing every time I sync, or open, a listing. I'm not sure if this is to do with the temperamental MAL servers, or a bug in the application itself; Either way please fix it, because it's a shame that I can't use it right now.</review_text>

            <review_text>Its really great overall and satisfies my needs greatly but when i scroll to my ptw list it frozes and crashes. I had over 300 anime in there if thats the problem. Tried on both GS3 and Note 10.1 and sent reports from both of them. It always crashes. Ill make it 5 stars after this is solved. Great job. Edit:an anime was the source of the problem.

            <review_text>I've been using MAL for Android for a while, but it was sad that it didn't receive updates anymore. A few hours ago I stumbled upon this app and I couldn't be happier! It has a great design and a sweet interface, it's fast and really easy to use! It's also great that there's still work being done on it. Please keep up your great work! Do you think it'd be possible to see prequels/sequels and recommendations on the DetailView?</review_text>

            <review_text>The latest version FCs when trying to sync. Edit: I'm looking forward to seeing it fixed. MAL had been a target of hackers again, so the site is still kind of buggy to use. I guess MALO is stable and immune to all of this because they are using different API.</review_text>

            <review_text>This is the best MAL client I've found in terms of both design and functionality. However, Atarashii! lacks a basic feature: the ability to search the MAL database to read info about new anime/add it to your list. Add that single feature, and you'll have the best MAL client there is!</review_text>

            <review_text>The switch list button should have radio buttons instead of checkboxes. I thought I could have a few lists displayed at once, as checkboxes suggest.
