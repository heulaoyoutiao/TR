            <review_text>The app used to be fast when I first installed it last year. But now it is sluggish and I often have to wait for it to open my conversation from a notification. Temporal and ancestral navigation is still not fixed since my last feedback. Also can't attach pictures from camera, but it worked before.</review_text>

            <review_text>Very nice looking app. Only two items I would suggest improvement on are to allow the attachment of a GIF from Gboard keyboard in the text field and to preview photos or videos in the default apps and not in the QK app itself. Keep up the good work!</review_text>

            <review_text>It is simple,doesn't take up space and it makes my phone run a lot smoother. Whatever the heck was going on with my phone when I got a msg was not working. The notification would lock up sometimes. I was getting texts much later than they were actually sent. So far so good. Thank you!</review_text>

            <review_text>I love it so much. It's easy to use and it looks nice. It looks amazing and the ability to customize everything is so useful.

            <review_text>Open source, smooth, attractive, and checks all boxes: night theme, color options, option to hide avatars in the conversation list, landscape mode, wide bubbles for max information density, etc. Problems: time stamps pop in slowly in group messages. All group messages display NoSubject instead of the start of the most recent message in the conversations list. Tapping a notification doesn't take me to the correct conversation. The back button to return to menu bugs sometimes.</review_text>

            <review_text>Was my favorite texting app until I found out there isn't an option to add a new contact from a message of a new number. How do you miss that? That's critical. Or am I missing a hidden gem of a feature? If it's there, it shouldn't be so hard to find.</review_text>

            <review_title>Good and light weight APP but needs improvement</review_title>
            <review_text>I am using the APP on Moto E3 POWER, though everything is working fine but I am unable to see old messages in the conversation. For example, at the home screen it is shown 11 messages in the conversation, but if I open the conversation I only get to see 4 messages. I have tried to search for options in setting but couldn't get anything. And second problem is that, the automatically delete option is only related to date, where as option should be their for count of messages also.</review_text>

            <review_text>Though my settings are right, and though my MMS are delivered withing my stock messagging app,. this app doesn't send the same MMS that my stock app does. Without this issue I would give it 5 stars and be happy to pay for it. There are also not enough options for the start button colors to choose from, and no aligment to the right for RTL languages. Missing dual sim support. No different coloring for each contact. There isn't a way to view the mobile network settings instalation messages.</review_text>

            <review_text>Absolute cancer ever since it was open sourced. Quick reply does nothing, contact names don't show up, donate buttons everywhere and randomly deletes messages. Dev doesn't care anymore.</review_text>

            <review_text>Very nice sms app. A few things I'd like to see added is ability to send video an audio. The blocking number feature could be better and not save the conversation option.</review_text>

            <review_title>Eliminate the notification pop-up</review_title>
            <review_text>I loved this app as a replacement to my stock LG G5 texting app. However, there does not seem to be an option to disable the notification pop-ups. This is my first non-Samsung phone since the S1, so adjusting to a new phone has proven to be very difficult. All I need is an all-black theme and background in order to save battery power (which this app does have), and non-intrusive notifications without pop-ups in my face, the latter of which has failed miserably. Add this option, and I will be one HAPPY user!</review_text>

            <review_text>Does not include scheduling option, delayed send only: so it's only bog standard amongst apps. Good customisation options - v similar to Textra; also integrates with 'should I answer' to sync blocking calls.</review_text>

            <review_text>This doesn't have far to go to be the very best SMS client on Android there is...

            <review_text>Really like it. Clean design, smooth and fast. But one issue I have is when someone text me with two different phone numbers, it won't just show me the contact names. It would just show one with the name and one with phone number. Weird. I don't see that in other apps. Pls fix it. Other than that it's pretty cool. Highly recommended.</review_text>

            <review_text>Входящие и исходящие сообщения разбивает на 2 цепочки. Номер одинаковый. Зачем так делает не понятно. При прокручивании вниз убирает кнопку срздания смс и обратно ее не возвращает. Поиск работает по содержимому смс. А бывает надо найти контакт в списке цепочек. Переключателя нет. А настройках переключаю один ползунок дергаются несколько. Удалил.</review_text>

            <review_title>Very nicely done</review_title>
            <review_text>I really like this sms app. This app is so much nicer than the standard Google sms app (messenger). Lots of features can be configured, such as turning off the avatars in the conversation window so you have more room for the actual messages. The code is open source which is very cool. There are no ads. It is free with a donate button in the app, I certainly sent the developer a donation.</review_text>

            <review_text>This is a lovely app with the best settings.

            <review_text>This app is simple to use, extremely good looking (adhere to material design), especially appearance settings are so easy to use. Does lack some high level customisation offered in other apps but not to worry as not used often. Icon needs some work as it should depict something on sms. QK compose is a superb feature who do lots of sms. Blocking &amp; blacklisting needs development as not much effective. Best part is it doesn't have any ADS</review_text>

            <review_text>The MMS stopped working shortly after installing the app. Countless bugs and glitches prevented me from truly liking this app. Maybe in a few years it will working perfectly, but for now I'd recommend steering clear of this app and find something else or sticking to the default on your phone. I feel like usage reports should be used to see how glitchy this app is, because the developers don't seem to be working on the problems (used for two months with always the same bugs and glitches).</review_text>

            <review_title>Would be five stars except..</review_title>
            <review_text>I really like it overall but there are many times it won't open. Sometimes when it does open it doesn't show contacts, only numbers. Crashes a lot. For instance, whenever I try to delete something. No easy way (that I've seen) to just save a new number. Doesn't tell me when I get mms messages. It'll have a flag but won't wake up my phone or pop up as a notification if it's already awake. Received pictures show up in a crappy slideshow and are about a tenth of my screen. Can't send videos.</review_text>

            <review_title>Amazing</review_title>
            <review_text>Coming from iOS, the only thing I miss is Apple's obsessive attention to detail. So QKSMS is a treasure to me! Fantastic functionality (popup replies, text delay, customisability, proximity sensor, etc) AND design. Things like having the choice to hide contacts' phone numbers on the messaging screen are a really nice touch. Devs: would like to see a grey icon option and some slick animations in Conversations page, but that's honestly all I can think of. Will donate on payday!</review_text>

            <review_text>App works great except when you receive SMS from eg. your provider (the one that you cant reply), then it will crash if I tap on icon (try to open contact details). Another issue is that you cant block that either (it dissapears, but on next app opening it shows up again).</review_text>

            <review_text>This app offers your choice of background colors, delivery confirmation, access to send from notification bar, works with Should I Answer? and is ad free. You may donate, if you like, through the app. Unfortunately, MMS does not work on my Moto G because my SIM shows multiple APN's, none of which is my phone company. I have sent QK messages to clear this up. But ironically, they do not receive my messages!</review_text>

            <review_text>I really like this app. Everything about it is great. But I've had so many problems with group messages the last few days I had to stop using it.

Messages don't always get marked as read and this app doesn't have full MMS integration with Yappy. Please fix this as I'd love to keep using this as my texting app.</review_text>

            <review_text>..its an awesome messaging app I really like how far this app has come it's awesome and you can now change the text tone and color for each conversation which is awesome only thing left to do is but at least for an sent sound option. I mean even some the other crappier SMS apps have a sent sound so I mean might not be important to some ppl but it should an option. Please! I know it's not a big deal to most people but some people like having a sent sound and go back to the old qksms icon</review_text>

            <review_text>I was looking for an app to replace my stock sms app. Messenger by Google was nice but too simple and lacked customization.

            <review_text>Would give it more stars, but I do not like how there is no way to resize the modal pop-up window. It appears the same size as the message which can cause the window size to vary. If there was a way for me to set height &amp; width of the modal pop up would easily get 5 stars.</review_text>

            <review_text>Would be great if it wasn't so buggy. Immediately found: Every time pressing back (with hardware button or in-app) the Android running apps list is shown for half a second. Crashed when I said OK to setup MMS dialog. No scrollbars except in settings. Settings randomly changes the state of other toggles when you change one (although exiting and entering settings fixes this - is not actually changing other settings, jusr very confusing). Briefly turned on data even though I had WiFi on. I'm on Android 4.4.2.</review_text>

            <review_text>As the review_title says, the app works perfectly and I love the quick reply feature. This app fits in well with stock android M apps with material design and such. Could we possibly get the option for using the old icon style as I liked the ability to have the icon the same as my theme and the new icon just doesn't fit with material design in my eyes. UPDATE: Developer responded and applied an upgrade to bring back icon styling, top developer that listens to the community!</review_text>

            <review_text>I like it. So light in size and clean. But can you fix the laggy QKREPLY portion? Such that it responds too late. Maybe, 8secs delayed after I had done my message? and also with the opening of the app. It also takes a moment for so long to launch. Well,, such a great app!! Very handy and useful shortcuts!!

            <review_text>This is an amazing app. Really customizable, and the simple design is easy to use. Also, it's open source! The only thing I'd like to see is different emoji packs. As most of my friends have iPhones (and the Samsung emojis look weird imo), I usually set my emojis to either Emoji One or iOS. I'd really like to see this feature added.</review_text>

            <review_text>I know this bug will get fixed, because the dev's are awesome. But I've been dealing with this for a while now. I occasionally don't get notifications when I receive a SMS or MMS. No LED blinking, nothing in my notification bar, no sounds or vibrate. I only realize I have a missed message by opening the app. Nova launcher with the tesla-unread plug-in doesn't even catch that I have a new message either. Verizon Samsung Galaxy s4</review_text>

            <review_text>Fantastic app that would just need one more change to make it five stars from me. Changes need to be made to the blocked messages section. Firstly the option to password protect this part of the app, furthermore the ability to hide it in the menus but access via holding down the compose button (as with GoSMS and a couple of others). Other than that, perfect. For the reason above though I would have to stick with GoSMS</review_text>

            <review_text>So far great app. Fast, light, just what you need. My first time giving a 5 star to an sms app. I might add to have a new option when creating a new message to show recent contacts in the call logs. Also, I suggest putting the timestamp in the middle rather than at the side because it cuts the conversation and it makes the conversation look cluttered. Putting it at the side confuses me also. Would also like to be able to swap between messages while inside the conversation. Pls reply devs</review_text>

            <review_text>Sending long text messages and sending and receiving pictures and vids... Very difficult. I have to turn off my WiFi to send and receive a picture and I have to break up my long text messages to send them. Also if I start typing and have to come back to the message, what I've typed isn't always there and I have to start over. Really love the app and would hate to have to stop using it</review_text>

            <review_text>The transitions when you open messages and when you go back to the main message panel are lag and are not smooth. It's annoying! I'm not installing this again, even with an update.</review_text>

            <review_text>It's coooll BUT I have and issue about the the length and width of the message bubble. There should be a setting in the appearance which allows the user to configure the desired length and width of the bubble because the present size of the bubble is way too big and it's not nice at all. Will give you 5 &#127775;s if you add that feature in the next update! &#128523; ;)</review_text>

            <review_title>Message Bubble not showing properly</review_title>
            <review_text>Sometimes when i send the message, the message bubble of the sender side (right side) shows strangely collapsed which hides the message and won't get okay after restarting app. And sometimes it collapses the bubble but does not hide the message but makes it one letter per line like hello becomes h e l and so on. I can send you the screenshot if u need. P.s: The receiver gets the message right.</review_text>

            <review_text>I have been a Textra user for quite some time now and was looking to switch things up a bit. The app is very solid. The only thing I really like more about Textra is the ability to personalize bubble colors for a specific contact. This is especially helpful during group texting.

            <review_text>My friends are telling me that longer texts are being broken up into separate messages. I tried using the toggle to enable longer messages to turn into MMS to avoid this but it's still separating them. Any suggestions? All is good otherwise!</review_text>

            <review_text>Great material design and look but with some ocassional irritating problems like not getting notifications all the time and app crashing. It is also annoying that not all messages have a time stamp and that you have to scroll the editing window to see the entire message you are writing. Going with textra again...</review_text>

            <review_text>When trying to attach an image or take a photo to send through compose, it does not work. I have to go to an already given conversation just to send a photo. I Can't begin a new one and send a photo first hand. Also when going into conversations the most recent picture is a picture from another conversation, but it's shown as all conversations when looking at the most recent photo.</review_text>

            <review_text>I dont understand why you launch this update after a lot of people told you on the beta that the app is not working fine. I deleted the beta because I couldn't use it like that and now you launch this update with the same issues(app doesn't launch) LE: Sometimes the app doesn't open, so I have to close it from memory and try again.</review_text>

            <review_text>I would have loved to give you all stars- you are good -really worth having on the device BUT -where is the dual sim support or the option to choose the preferred sim to send the text through . If so then I would love to send the first message to you only.</review_text>

            <review_text>Light and fast open source sms app, does what it says without too much extra cruft. The icon is unfortunately both hideous and hard to see, given it's only in black and white. Recommend pickable colours at the very least.</review_text>

            <review_text>So I like the app, just have three main problems. One I wish it would use my edge features when I get texts. Two I can't send or receive pictures. And third I don't care for the pop up that shows up, even when I am in the conversation. I know I can block all information. I just wanted to not have it. Especially if I'm in the conversation already. I'll give it a few days and see if I can hang, if not I'll be looking for something else. Other then those, it runs so smoothly and I love how quick it is.</review_text>

            <review_text>Excellent application. There are occasional visual bugs that don't detract from functionality and disappear when closed and re-opened (for example: name of incoming message reflects most recent conversation instead of sender, empty toast displays; or, contact list shows numbers instead of names). However, this is rare, and the app is in general very cleanly made and easy to use and configure. The new icon (white donut-shaped Q) is ugly, and I preferred the previous one.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really love the app but it has a flaw, for my personal use, that makes it a bit useless. I have a dual SIM phone and the app doesn't allow me to choose whether I want to text from one SIM or the other. I normally text through my work SIM a lot but the app always sent them via my personal one. Please fix this and I will come back to have as my default one. Cheers</review_text>

I've been having issues when quick replying on Android N like when I have two messages in my notifications and I use the quick reply to the person I wanna send the message to it instead sends to the other person in my notification.</review_text>

            <review_title>Great, except...</review_title>
            <review_text>This app is incredibly well designed, and would be perfect except for two issues that make it borderline unusable. First thing, there's no option for notification sounds to repeat, so I might not get the message until I happen to look at the screen possibly hours later. Every dumbphone I ever had could do that, so it seems almost ridiculous that I've been using this app for almost two years and the feature still hasn't been added. And secondly, the Automatic data option for MMS is broken. Just completely.</review_text>

Don't know if it's the latest build, but the app has gotten to the point where I'll press a button and wait 3 or 4 seconds for the app to respond.

            <review_title>Great SMS app</review_title>
            <review_text>Love the fact that this has Samsung multi window support. Very clean UI. Only wish it has media button in each conversation to view images that were sent and received. I see an issue where if I turn off the pop-up notification, when I receive a message, I have 3 choices, click the message, hit the read button or the reply button, and the reply and read buttons do not work.</review_text>

            <review_title>Could be great, but....</review_title>
            <review_text>Tends to crash almost every time I open a message, especially if it is a group message. Have not received all texts that I've been sent. Also, very laggy and slow at times. Has potential to be the best texting app on the market, but has to get these things fixed first.</review_text>

            <review_text>It's a really nice texting app. Great design, easy to use, however there are some bugs. The main one is that about one out of every 4 times opening the app, it blacks out, meaning there's nothing on the screen and you have to back out or clear your open apps. Another thing is that sometimes when you try to call someone from the contact option, it calls someone else (I believe it's the last persons conversation you were in).</review_text>

            <review_text>The app is quick and lightweight for sure and has a good set of features as well. Supposedly open source as well!! All great... However on using it the app is a little glitchy. The settings toggles seem to not work correctly. Sometimes when off they are lit up and vice versa. The slide to view previous conversation is weird and doesn't work on my phone. It also showed the settings as a previous conversation. LOL. Tried on lollipop xperia z1</review_text>

            <review_title>Best one for now!</review_title>
            <review_text>I have tried each of the most popular sms apps (Chomp, textra, go sms, handcent etc) and this one is the best. Chomp was also nice but had issues with mms. QKSMS is beautiful, customizable and works well for now. The only 2 things that could be better are: Possibility to chose square contact thumbnails instead of circle, and a bit faster app opening. Textra and Chomp opened immediately while QKSMS opens with a delay of 1 second-and I'm using rather a top device (LG G4).</review_text>

Also it would be great if the quick reply box would open if I click a button in a notification rather then just popping up over what I'm doing</review_text>

            <review_text>I've tried to use this app to replace my default text app many times in the past. It's a simple yet beautiful app that's also pretty snappy. I'm giving it 4 stars though because notifications are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes they work perfect, sometimes the sound works but there's no notification, and sometimes nothing comes up at all. I think if this is fixed, it will definitely be the best sms app out there! EDIT: This is more of a suggestion, but the proximity sensor feature is way too sensitive.</review_text>

            <review_text>There are a lot of cool options but the app doesn't work well when visiting settings. After making updates to the settings, the settings page won't completely close. It hangs out on the edge of the screen (see what I did there?). Same happens whenever you enter into a.chat screen. Leaving a chat to go to the main screen leaves the chat heads on the edge of the screen as well (oops. I did it again).</review_text>

            <review_title>Sim card duality, contact save directly from the app</review_title>
            <review_text>It looks great, the UI is very aesthetically pleasing. However, there are two important functions that I still yet to get from this app. Firstly, Android phones commonly have dual sim cards and this app doesn't have the option for users to choose from which sim card they're sending the message from. Second, it doesn't have the option to directly save a contact from within the app. Also, a bug is literally annoying me. When I launch the app, it freezes, displays contact numbers instead of names and crashes.</review_text>

            <review_text>So I downloaded this app for my Samsung Galaxy s5 and it kinda worked at the beginning. But now if I have screen rotation on it glitches the app and freshly opening it, the conversations don't pop up and the app doesn't work. I have to relaunch it about 3 times for it to work.</review_text>

            <review_text>This app makes it incredibly difficult to love texting. It is very buggy and now won't sent messages. Half the time I don't get notifications and it's more of a hassle than previous apps. Sadly, it has potential, but nowhere near where it should be.</review_text>

            <review_text>I needed a material SMS app with group chat capabilities, and this was the only one I found that fit the bill. My one issue was that in big group chats, the avatars wouldn't show up each time people switch talking, which could make the conversation hard to follow. However, the dev listened and fixed this. Now this is the perfect messaging app.</review_text>

            <review_title>Love it</review_title>
            <review_text>I love the decency and elegance of the look of this messaging app. I just hope that for the nxt update you'll add some smooth transitions/animations like when opening a conversation and sending a message. That would make this app alot better. Also, when changing the settings, some of them needs the app to restart before they take effect. I hope that can be fixed too. Thanks alot!</review_text>

            <review_text>Can we get support for sharing contact info through text? So far it has been a great app, but would love that function.

            <review_text>After such a promising start, this is just another complete letdown of an SMS app. So, so many issues/bugs in the last couple of updates, it's as if the devs are actually trying to break an app that was already working fine. Very frustrating after paying for the 'Pro' (or whatever) version in the early days of the app's development. Poor show from devs, I'm afraid. Just not acceptable. Avoid.</review_text>

            <review_title>Awesome AOSP messaging alternative!</review_title>
            <review_text>I just downloaded this app, and I can already tell that it's superior to others on the app store. Interface is smooth, there's LOADS of customization compared to Google's Messenger or hangouts, and you can even change the icon to match your theme color from the app! I can also send and receive MMS with Wi-Fi enabled, as opposed to having trouble with some other apps. Altogether, if you've had some trouble with SMS apps in the past and you're looking to call one home, this is it! Keep up the great work!</review_text>

            <review_title>Your New Texting App</review_title>
            <review_text>I didn't think I'd ever say it, but it has happened: I finally found an app I am willing to replace my stock messaging application with. QKSMS has far exceeded my expectations. So many great features. IMPROVEMENT REQUESTS: Better visual notice of failed-to-send text messages, ability to block numbers from calling/texting, support for GIFs and fix for group messaging - system is completely broken, always crashes in group chat, videos are unstable/crash app, quickly see who sent individual group messages.</review_text>

            <review_text>Wow, this app is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, the UI is 10000 times better than Textra's... But where are my Gifs? I need the ability to send Gifs and vCards... Those are really important to me! Please add the option to send Gifs as MMS (not as links, and grab them directly from the app just like in Textra) and I will 100% switch from Textra to you... I love your UI so much more than Textra's, but I'll stick with them for now cause they have way more options! Please add Gifs!</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is amazing! It's so fast, much faster than the stock app! Great interface and customisation options. Really very impressed. The only issue is MMS images display really small when they're pressed on. Doesn't match the rest of the UI. Also, when in a message pressing the back button causes the screen to kind of flash, this is a UI bug.</review_text>

            <review_title>My second favorite texting app</review_title>
            <review_text>There isn't a perfect texting app for me-but hopefully if you guys consider my suggestions, there can be! I would like there to be a scheduled text option, so I can write a text and have it be sent at a predetermined day/time. Also I would like there to be notification settings (light, icon, vibrate, sound) i can set for each person/group conversation, including muting someone (not blocking) all together.</review_text>

            <review_text>It took up to 5 seconds just for my texts to pop up in the conversation. Half the time it wouldn't open. I cant customize the light notification to individual contacts in another app like i can with textra. Plus the texts don't show up on my lock screen. I think the colors are amazing but at this point are to many bugs going on at this point i cant use it.</review_text>

            <review_text>I love the way it looks and moves and feels but its lacking a few things. I want a better quick reply. AWsms has the best quick reply I've ever used on a texting app. I would like to see that added in. Also I would like more custom options, like changing message bubble colors. Other than that its a great app. So all in all I just really want a better quick reply added to it! Thanks again!</review_text>

            <review_text>Very small footprint. Fast and responsive with adequate customizability. Retains most of UI in Messenger. Mark As Read from notification could be the sole reason for replacing the stock app for this app. Miss the random colours on the chat list, though. The only issue I found was that it did not find messages containing search words, while stock Messenger did. Keep it snappy and error-free but do not weigh down with too many extra features.</review_text>

            <review_text>After divorcing 2 awful SMS apps I found this. I love the fluidity and simplicity this app has. My only quarrels that made me dock 2 stars are that 1. I can't customize my vibration sound, I got used to not having it in my last app but would love it here and 2. We'll this isn't really a problem but in previous apps there was a button to send a sample message to yourself to see things like notification changes, led blinker or your vibration settings if you had them. These things would have me hooked for life</review_text>

            <review_text>The only suggestion I have is putting the same contact/different numbers all into one thread, instead of having different threads. I have multiple numbers for people, but I don't want to delete them because I want to keep them in the thread. And I can't change the message font size. I can change the settings font size, but not when I'm in a message thread. Otherwise, this app is really great!!</review_text>

            <review_text>If WiFi calling is on, this app fails to send MMS. It seems like it is waiting for data to connect and doesn't know to try anyway. Other texting apps work fine. MMS was configured correctly. Nexus 6P stock 6.0.1</review_text>

            <review_text>I tried this out of curiosity because I'd been using Textra for months and didn't think anything could beat it. I was wrong! Qksms has a similar feature set but is much quicker to use. And it's (now) free! Seems to hang every other day, though!</review_text>

            <review_text>When talking in group messages there is no way of knowing who is sending what text because there's no contact picture or anything by the text. Once this is fixed I will rate 5 stars.</review_text>

            <review_text>The app is fast and smooth, and has a proper quick reply that actually shows what you're replying to (looking at you, Google Messenger.) The only feature I would love to have is the quick reply window on the lock screen, like Textra has. Other than that, this is now my preferred messaging app. Thanks for all the work!</review_text>

            <review_text>Looking for a great alternative SMS app, this is one of the top. It's got all the features you'd expect. Only flaw is the search feature which displays results from the oldest occurrence to the newest, which is annoying and there's no quick scrolling for those of you that have thousands of SMS's.</review_text>

            <review_text>I have an issue with multiple messages being sent when using my hardware keyboard on the Blackberry Priv. I have enter set to send message. But it always sends two messages. My original message. And then a second blank one that says sending and never completes. I have to manually delete each one. Other than that an option to add a notification on sent messages would be great . Other than that, it's a great app. Keep up the good work!! I just noticed it doesn't happen in pop-up reply window</review_text>

            <review_text>I don't like how there is a pop up on the top when there's a new text. If there was an option to just have a new message shown as a ticker in the notification bar instead of the pop up, I'd be in heaven! (yes I have the pop off option turned off already).</review_text>

            <review_text>Clean design, many nice features and very user friendly, but many bugs. Not smooth. It still lags (albeit less) and freezes with a white screen. The pop-up window lags too, not showing the body of the message for 2 seconds or so. It tends to pop up even when I'm within the app! Drafts are not visible! I have to open my stock app to see them. Deleted messages are not being deleted (I still see them in the stock app). Also, the new message indicator on the qksms icon shows I've got a new txt when I have none.</review_text>

            <review_title>When in doubt, go QKSMS</review_title>
            <review_text>I've struggled to find a sms app that fulfils all of my requirements: material design, mms support, read recipts, and integration with contacts; QKSMS does it all. With its countless colour palates, it's simple, custom mms settings, and easy to use menu system (which in my opinion is much better than stock HTC sense), it's clear what sms app I will use as long as it's supported. Keep up the amazing work devs, hope to see more amazing projects from y'all soon!</review_text>

            <review_title>MMS Issue</review_title>
            <review_text>I want to like the app, for a while I had primarily used this as my SMS application, however I have too many issues with MMS(picture and group messaging). Pictures will randomly not show up that have already been sent or received, scrolling up and down may make them show up again. The biggest issue is with group messaging. The app does not always show which person sent the message and you have to check details of individual message to see the number. Had these issues on 2 different phones.</review_text>

            <review_text>The main bugs for me are, when the screen orientation changes when half way through writing a message, it clears what I have written and I have to start again, it doesn't seem to save drafts at all so if I start typing and have to refer to another app like Gmail for example, when I return back to qksms to finish the message it has cleared it again. Also the sender name seems intermittent in the inbox, most times its fine but sometimes it just displays the number and I can't get it to show the name.</review_text>

            <review_text>My daily messaging app. My only gripes are sometimes it gets stuck sending a message and that there isn't a less obtrusive qkreply. I would prefer being able to slide from the top and reply there. Or maybe do something different with qkreply? If you're gonna give a simple pop up reply function that every app has a special name, I think you should differentiate yourself more.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really enjoy the app, one thing I really wish is that I am able to assign more than on color to different people. Group messaging is confusing with the same colors for everyone and the only way to tell who sent each message is to click on the details of the message.</review_text>

            <review_text>I am still comparing to the stock messenger and later some competition. But so far from what I see it looks good. Love the customizations of backgrounds. Would like to see you add a privacy policy tho so I know exactly what's going on before I delete the app for Textra.. This app also seems to sync good with the Hub on my BlackBerry, behaves similar to stock google in that it launches the app to view message out side the hub...</review_text>

            <review_text>Good looking app, just need to fix a couple things. First, the animation when you touch the 3 dots in the top right corner of the app is very laggy on the animation. Second, when you change the color of the app icon based on the theme you chose, it's still the default color when you multitask and see it in the recent apps. Running 6.0 Marshmallow. Otherwise it's one of the best messaging apps out there.</review_text>

            <review_text>This is probably my favorite texting app I've found thus far, but there's one thing that I can't stand about it. When my signal is too low it instantly tells me the message failed to send and it won't even try to send it. I've never had this issue in any other app and it happens to me constantly with this one. I would like it if it at least tried to send it or waited a little bit until the signal improves instead of giving up instantly. Also some more options for customization would be nice.</review_text>

            <review_text>I love the simplicity, neatness and sophistication of this app, plus its being ad free. Hopefully on you next update, it's something to do with group messaging. Like most messaging apps, when sending a message to multiple people, aside from it showing on each receiver's thread, every message should be found in one thread so I don't need to retype the names of my receivers in every message I wish to send by group. I tried several messaging apps available in Google play store and even the default messaging app of my Sony Xperia C3 failed me in sending group messages for they can't cater long messages that are mostly sent in group, it keeps prompting error messages before a message is successfully sent. And I'm hoping that this messaging app is not like that. With your next update, hopefully you'll have several options for font styles like the choco cooky font style of Samsung phones for that's actually my frustration in my phone (At least I can achieve it through this messaging app). I really love this app that's why I'm making an effort to help in its improvement. Kudos QKSMS team!</review_text>

            <review_text>i like it, it looks really nice and whatnot, but the auto mms settings threw my phone off so bad that i had to factory reset it to get them back. that and every mms i get now shows up as the same one picture. it might be promising in the future but as of right now it just isn't there yet.</review_text>

            <review_text>I'm using this to replace textra, which was not giving me notifications sometimes. This app seems pretty similar and so far I have no problems with it. The only thing I would suggest is adding an option to turn off the badge count (like the little numbers on the app icon that say how many unread messages you have).</review_text>

            <review_text>I hated texting and all the other SMS apps are very contrived. This is easy to use and provides a better interface than stick while still paying homage to material in a stylish way. The only downsides are that some small extras are missing. Personal customization could be a little more in depth, as well as vibration pattern. Also, an in-app mini camera would be nice, and voice recorder. All unnecessary, but bonuses.</review_text>

            <review_text>Hello team, loving the app by the way but the small font size is way too small to be called as small. Are there any tweaks you can provide to have it resize through percentage? 50%-200% instead of having small, medium etc configuration. Would also be happy if you may add the automatic retry resending when messages failed. Thank you.</review_text>

            <review_text>MMS works but it comes with a couple flaws. First, sometimes when you go into a message thread, pictures from MMS' sometimes don't show up or show up all as an older or random picture until you back out and back into that thread. Secondly on AT&amp;T, group MMS' take 10-20 seconds longer than the usual 3-5 seconds (I tested with other apps; it's not the carrier), and don't send sometimes until another group member has texted back. Please look into these. Your work and app are greatly appreciated. Thanks!</review_text>

            <review_text>If you are looking for an effective everyday sms app that works well and has a clear good looking UI plus a more than adequate set of user options try this app. It works well for me using HTC One M7.</review_text>

            <review_text>Free, no ads at all, good customization. However it seems like in my z3 compact there are some instances that the sound wont play once a message was received.

            <review_text>The app is finally fast enough to be used regularly, but suddenly it's eating away at battery when I'm not even using it.

            <review_text>I like this app but I wish it was faster, I text a lot and when I open the app and click on a conversation and the text messages doesn't show up so I have to close the app and reopen it. Wish this could get fixed. Also some of the messages I text don't send so have to resend them all the time so if they can fix this problem it would b great, cuz I like this app but might change apps because of it</review_text>

            <review_text>I just set the mms up and it became laggy. App wouldn't show my texts till 5 seconds or so later. Wasn't like this running previous Google and other sms apps. I'll pass on this and come back later...</review_text>

            <review_text>I really really love this app! Ever since the beta testing I was apart of I have loved it. The issues I am having are as follows: 1. Notifications disappearing... (Whenever I lock the device while I was in the conversation and get a reply, the notification appears and then disappears..) 2. Compose message (In-App) on rotate: clears all entry (VERY ANNOYING) 3. Entire conversation list disappears (requires app restart) 4. (Others I'm forgetting at the moment.)</review_text>

            <review_title>Battery drain issue</review_title>
            <review_text>I'm using an Xperia Z3 and my battery drained from 100% to 12% in about 5 hours with almost no use. According to stats, this is the biggest use of my battery. My phone has also been running insanely hot and I suspect this may be affecting that.</review_text>

            <review_title>Terrible update - how do I downgrade to previous version?</review_title>
            <review_text>App was working fine besides some MMS problems when receiving group msgs especially with iPhones. New update has made this worse, plus some other issues. For example when new message is received it doesn't say the senders name or the message just says New QKSMS message received. I want to see preview of sender and message like before. Wake lock function still broken. How do I downgrade to previous version? Otherwise will have to move to a different text messaging app even though I really liked this one.</review_text>

            <review_text>It's unfortunate that QKSMS seems to be the only app I can get my MMS to work through Straight Talk, but for a while now there has been a mysterious battery drain that can potentially deplete it in a few minutes from 100%. I've read countless threads about this... I'd love to help by sending some sort of information, because this is a very dangerous app to use in unfortunate circumstances. EDIT: Thanks for the speedy response. I've returned my review to 5 (sorry!) I can't wait for the fix :)</review_text>

            <review_text>Really fast send of photos compared to hangout and samsung stock. Only drawback is annoying message box in middle of screen when get new message. Many times it interferes with note taking.</review_text>

            <review_text>I am using this app for quite a long time and I was very happy with it, but every time I do update, app becomes worse. For example: there is no more enter key when you compose message and cannot bring it back in settings, like it could before. When I compose message and change from landscape to portrait orientation, or vice versa, draft message is lost and I have to type it all again. When new message arrives, in notification bar just pops up new message, and it does not go through the message...</review_text>

            <review_text>Been a looooong time user of QKSMS. Huge fan of this app :) So I use HeadsOff to receive ticker-style notifications rather than heads up. Ever since I updated QKSMS to the latest version, the notification doesn't show the sender's name and message - it shows, QKSMS: New message despite my privacy settings allowing the message to be shown.</review_text>

            <review_text>Pretty decent so far. Found this on r/Android and it is pretty quick. My only issue is with the widget. I want to be able to adjust the font size and weight on this, as the font settings do not carry over to the widget. Also, can there be an option to remove the review_title Conversations so there can be more space for actual content? I know what it is and don't need to be reminded. Thanks!</review_text>

            <review_text>I like that it's open source and donation based. It's fantastic that it's adless. it works well enough, and the customization options are awesome. it isn't without problems though. the quick reply pop up sometimes displays the wrong conversation and group messaging can get very difficult to read as there isn't a lot of distinction between different sender's. other than that, for the most part it works well and has very few problems.</review_text>

            <review_text>Why is their a donate button on every page that doesn't work and crashes the app? Why can't I delete more than one text at a time?

            <review_text>I've been looking for a decent SMS app and I do believe that I've found it! It's like the developer took the best parts of other SMS apps and combined them into this app! The one thing that would give it five stars for me is if there was a private box, to shield messages sent/received with certain contacts from someone other than myself looking at my messages.</review_text>

            <review_text>I've tried many sms this one looks good. Couple of things would make a brilliant app 1. Allow contrasting colours. 2. Give avatars material design colours. If no photo. 3. Seems strange to scroll threads up rather than down. Only been using this for a couple will do a more in depth review after a couple of days. Having used this app for s week now its great but why does it keep calling people I text? Had to stop using this because it keeps calling people I text</review_text>

            <review_text>Most of the texting that I do is group texting with my team, and there are 10 people in the chat. This app seemed to work well with it, which many others do not. When I got a long string of different messages from different people, the name of who sent each was under the text. But then, after 10 seconds or so, the names disappear, and I can no longer see who sent what. If I wanted to, I would have to force close the app and then reopen it just to see who sent what for another 10 seconds.</review_text>

            <review_text>Very nice! Simple, clean, does the job. I like: disabling showing useless avatars, setting much bigger font, setting black background and no ads at all. I'd like: the delete button next to check mark on the incoming message window. It doesn't wake up my phone. A had to install SMS WakeUp, uninstall QKSMS, install again and then it works.</review_text>

            <review_text>Finally gave qksms another shot since I just got a moto 360. It's much improved, even mms is working for me now (turned off the Automatic Data setting in mms settings and it works now). Only minor issue is it tends to lag a bit in messages where there are a lot of messages and there's no way to delete older messages.</review_text>

            <review_text>It's definitely a beautiful app with everything I'm looking for, but for some reason it won't show the name of some of my contacts, and they just appear as a number. Once that's fixed, it's a definite 5 stars</review_text>

            <review_text>But, I have been using handcent sms for quite a while, and it started lagging and taking up all my battery. So the quest for a new sms app happened. I stumbled upon this after quite a search, and it has almost everything I want, I just had one suggestion for a 5 star review, can you let us change the bubble colors for a specific person? Like, I may want yellow for one of my friends, but a blue for another. Is that possible?</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is pretty much perfect. The only way to improve it would be to add the option to assign different colors to every contact, sort of like Google messenger does. My main problem that stops me from using it is the fact that the app crashes all the time. I'll reinstall it in a couple of weeks to see if that gets fixed</review_text>

            <review_text>Hey there! I got this app because I saw you in an HH group. I really love using it, but I can never get MMS to work well. Sometimes it sends, but it never receives. This might be due to data being off, but it should let me know that's the case, as Textra does. Other than the MMS issue, this app is amazing. I'm on an HTC One m8. Nice work!</review_text>

            <review_text>It almost has all the configuration options I want in a texting app. However, these should be implemented: Different shaped/sized text bubbles and options to use background wallpaper. Even the default SMS app gives us that. It would be awesome in this app.</review_text>

            <review_text>Great job by dev to fix crashes very quick after reporting. Would like to have automatic removal of old messages past a certain amount. Also, the auto-enabled data connection to get MMS doesn't always disable after retrieval.</review_text>

            <review_text>I love that I can make my own Wear quick responses but the upside down conversation is bad and when you get 2 notifications in Wear from the same conversation you get both in one notification and cannot see the first text without scrolling through a backward conversation.

            <review_text>In size, but super annoying. The popup for replies should only really come up if in app. Seeing the squished popup displayed over the actual conversation I'm replying to is a bit weird. Without this the app is five stars, this just really affects how I use an SMS app (want a popup when out of app so I don't have to open it to quick reply, want that popup closed automatically if the app is open and the current focus). Awesome in every other way.</review_text>

            <review_text>There's only one reason why I don't use this app (as well as Textra). I do a lot of group messaging, and when you try to add multiple recipients, after you type in a name, the cursor goes straight to the message section, rather than staying in the contacts section so that I can continue to add more recipients. I have to go tap the contacts section again to add more people. Not an issue for many, but an annoyance for me. Otherwise, great app!</review_text>

            <review_text>Hello, please add the ability to choose to quick reply from a locked screen. I have a S4 and the wake screen does not work. I have a pebble watch and I do not receive notifications through my pebble when received on the app on my phone. Would like the option to change the font and bubble styles. Maybe later add the ability to make more changes to the background to place my own images. The contact information takes a while to update to the person's contact name when opening the app. So far no major issues.</review_text>

            <review_text>Hi there! Love the app. It is hands down my favourite messaging app on my phone. Although, what would make this really amazing is an Android Wear app. (Ability to scroll through texts, view conversations, and send messages (possibly with a keyboard?)). Hope that's not asking for too much. It's just an idea!</review_text>

            <review_text>Love it; except it crashes on me at least a few times a day. Sometimes while in the background, sometimes while replying, or while typing. I'd also love to see giphy(or similar) integration, similar to Textra. That's really the only thing keeping this from being a 100% Textra alternative.</review_text>

            <review_text>The app only recognizes photos from my contacts saved to my Google account. Any of my contacts (the majority) that are synced from Facebook won't use the Facebook photo my contacts uses. This is annoying as every conversation just has a solid circle beside it.

So far, this is the only feature that my previous SMS/MMS app had that I used a lot that I'm really gonna miss. Otherwise, great work! Fast, sleek, minimal, gorgeous UI, and solid.

            <review_text>Highly customizable thats what love about this app. But on my Xperia Z Ultra, I cant seem to get rid of the gradient on status bar and navigation bar, if I turn tinting off then both bars will turn black, tried the option in advanced setting, no luck either. Also, going into sms threads lag unpleasantly</review_text>

            <review_text>My GF texted me, and the quick reply wasn't even labeled to her. It was for a completely different person. Also sometimes when I open a conversation to someone I've been talking to it'll be completely blank. It won't even have the person's name on the top, and after I exit the app and reopen it it's fine.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really love the look and feel of this app, it's fluid and I really want to keep using it, but the mms isn't working and it would be great to have some more features like textra with the emojis and the quick access to photos instead of having to open the gallery. And the ability to quickly send contacts as well! As soon as some features like that are added, it will be my default messaging app, but until then I'll have to stick with textra!</review_text>

            <review_text>MMS functionality in the app is still a bit wonky, and the widget glitches out a good bit (and updates very infrequently). Really my only complaints. Everything else is top notch. The slight delay after hitting send is absolutely genius.</review_text>

            <review_text>The design is nice but I feel plain (considering other text/sms applications). I really like Evolve and Go SMS, but feel there are too many glitches with those apps. QK seems to have strong functionality but I would like to be able to add my own background images as well as to be able to insert files that are saved on my device. I LOVE the delayed message option that another user recommended. i TRIED USING IT AND IT DID NOT WORK. This frustrates me. I need one reliable text app with features that both enhance and enrich the experience. This is an OK app and needs some work.</review_text>

            <review_text>There's a lag in the animation when selecting a conversation. All of these new Material Design based SMS apps seem to have one fatal flaw each, if this one is fixed, it'd be perfect. EDIT: Reduced to 3 stars, upgrade attempt FC's and causes certain contacts names to disappear at random, only shows number as if they were unknown.</review_text>

            <review_text>Great features...EXCEPT... It is using way to many precious resources and constantly restarting. Can't delete messages automatically, takes too long. Pictures load incredibly slow and no video support to send even short videos.I do love the popup text alert box and instant response even when in another app. t is by far its best feature. But the other issues have me searching for something better.</review_text>

            <review_text>Nice texting app. Clean design and ui. Two features it could use are: option to select iPhone emoji, and rejoining split messages (e.g., AT&amp;T to Verizon). Update: I really want to like this app, but after using it for a bit it's not quite ready for prime time. Trouble attaching and deleting pics, deleting conversations, lack of notification of new messages and so on. Still some bugs to be worked out.</review_text>

            <review_title>Amazing fast texting app with a major flaw</review_title>
            <review_text>The app is super clean fluid and very user friendly. You can customize most things but not as much as some apps...I prefer it this way though, because it gives the app a unified modern look. It has the best pop up notification window out of any texting app. The major flaw which makes me remove 2 stars is the fact that it takes forever for photos to be sent while some don't ever send and you can't send video at all. Guess I'll have to keep looking for that perfect texting app....this was so close.</review_text>

            <review_text>But it desperately needs an option to automatically delete old messages i.e. Limit a thread to 500 messages. The app seems to lag pretty hard in conversations with thousands of messages, and it's not really feasible to manually delete that many messages. I have to keep switching to other sms apps and use them to automatically delete old messages, before switching back</review_text>

            <review_text>Latest version is broken. Launching the app and opening a conversation, actually doesn't load the contact number and name, which means that I can't send an SMS without a targeted phone number. I need to exit and open it again. Sometimes I forget about this issue, type a message and hit send, the app then empties the writing box and displays an error, so I have to type everything again.</review_text>

            <review_text>I installed this earlier and so far I am really liking it! I like that when I open it it says Conversations instead of the regular QKSMS. It looks like an actual messaging system. I like how it is clean and how lovely the interface is, I like the colors available and I will be using this as my default messenging app now and if I don't run into any problems with is app then I will purchase pro version.

            <review_text>1. I use action launcher.... And I'm using custom color app icon based on theme in QKSMS.... The issue is that every now and then the icon from home screen gets erased. And i need to make its shortcut again and again 2 .In compose mode when background color is set dark gray or black....I can't see suggested contacts while typing recipient name. No problem when it's white or of white. I love dark gray mode though and really want this big fixed. 3. delete button for new SMS received in notification drawer.</review_text>

            <review_text>I'm really liking QKSMS having only installed it recently. It's extremely fast, which I can't say about some other apps (ahem, mysms), and its completely free with no annoying ads! It also handles the T-Mobile WiFi calling MMS conflict the best out of any app I've seen! The only problem I have with it is when you're in night mode and go to enter a recipient for a new text, the search results are in white text on a white background, so you can't see who you're choosing, womp.</review_text>

            <review_text>Checked out the app. Impressive, but needs a feature to delete old text messages so that the app doesn't swell and take up a lot of space. Evolve has it, which is why I can't move away from that app just yet. This app reminds me of textra. Textra also needs the delete old messages feature. If that feature is added, I'd install and use.</review_text>

Because this is the most important tweak I need right now, its the only one I'll mention just yet. Would be worth supporting paid version for this. Does mute conversation effectively work like blacklist? That would be cool... Thank you.... Alright another important missing feature: can't send audio files, no audio record button.</review_text>

            <review_title>My favorite sms by far. But there are a few issues</review_title>
            <review_text>The main thing that is killing me is that if I get a text, and open it through the notification drawer or the pop-up, it jumps to that conversation, but I can't see the text! I can read the text in the pop-up, but in the actual app/conversation, it won't show their most recent text. I have to close the whole app and reopen it, or go to another conversation and back. Super annoying. Also, sometimes it will show said conversation under another contact name. I love the app, but starting to get annoyed.</review_text>

            <review_title>An excellent app but,</review_title>
            <review_text>The UI and the app itself is execellent but could use some changes. For example the add buttin in a conversation should be on the left side and adding a voice recorder would benefit alot of people. Also the focus too much on the UI cause a little lag on the app. Making the response performance better would be greatly appreciated. This app is all around the biggest competitior of textra but, it'sHard to decide but for now i will use qksms and see what they improve on it and such.</review_text>

            <review_text>It really is awesome. The night mode and markdown are such a bonus. The only thing I wish would be changed is the quick reply. It is annoying how it pops right in front of you. Maybe this could be a setting where you can tap the notification to use the quick reply? That's my only criticism as this app is incredible. I downloaded it to try after I read an article on the dev. Awesome work!</review_text>

            <review_text>I forget why I had stopped using this app but I decided to give it another try, re-installed and WOW! Tons of new improvements &amp; the updated UI looks fabulous. I especially &#128150; how the app let's you change its system icon color to match your theme color. And most important of all: pop-ups for new messages. Great app &#128077;&#128077;&#128077;&#128077;&#128077;</review_text>

            <review_title>Design flaw in message editor</review_title>
            <review_text>This is a 4.5 star app however there is quite a serious design flaw : the message editing box can only show 3 lines of text &amp; it's hard to scroll. Should be larger or dynamically readjust based on message length. In the same way, you can't preview your full msg during a delayed send which is unhelpful.</review_text>

            <review_text>First, I love the way this app looks. Fantastic job devs. Why does everyone make ugly sms apps?? Second, I would absolutely love if they could take their quick reply feature, and add in a heads feature. Similar to hoverchat and Facebook's messenger app. Please tell me this is on the way. Third, sending, receiving and viewing picture messages can be kinda buggy, but I'm sure they will fix it. Once those two are fixed/added it will be 5 all the way</review_text>

            <review_text>Bugs I've noticed so far is that the app does not actually delete messages, I have another SMS app and I go in all the messages I thought I deleted with QK are still there. Theres NO notification of received MMS when data is disabled. When going back into the app when i have a new sms the sms doesnt show up, its blank. And is there any way to make the send icon a little smaller? I think it would fit in well with the overall look of the app. Also, an option to auto enable data when sending and receiving MMS?</review_text>

            <review_text>I was looking for something to replace Textra since I hate the updated Textra. I found QKSMS and I love it. It is what I liked about the previous Textra and more. I only wish there was an option that Textra had; to change the return button on the keyboard to Send instead of having to hit the send button next to your message. Which would then make the keyboard go away after clicking send. Only option I see is to turn that button into Emoji's and I do not want that. Other than that it is great!</review_text>

            <review_text>It is great when it works correctly, but half of the time it starts group texts when I just send pictures to one person and when the pop up window comes up it doesn't show who sent the text it shows who I texted last even if they did not text me.

            <review_title>Beautiful, but not quite</review_title>
            <review_text>Hands down the most beautiful texting app on Android. However small bugs really detract from the overall experience. Sometimes SMS and MMS messages from one contact will temporarily appear in another conversation if you quickly switch conversations. Also, entire conversations sometimes temporarily disappear when opening the app through quick reply. It's these small clunky bugs that really hold this app back from being one of the best. Using LG G4</review_text>

            <review_text>I've tried Textra, Evolve, Hangouts, Messenger, etc, etc. None are like this one. Want to remove the stupid avatars while SMS? Cool, do it. Want to do tabbing? Lol no problem. You feeling blue today? Doesn't matter to me, change your color. Do you like quick reply but hate quick compose? Go ahead and make it that way. Like LED alerts? Fine, you have like 6 different colors to chose from. Like privacy and notifications? Screw it, block all those sexts and still get notifications. *MMS doesn't work though :(</review_text>

            <review_text>Many of my conversation are lost. at the end when I'm ready to close there is no send icon and when I tap to look for it your app just loses the whole conversation and my time is wasted. this happens way too often. I just had your app delete a whole message while I was trying to find your damneud send icon. there never is a send icon buddy! The second point is a good programmer never deletes anything obviously vital without asking for a confirmation! not asking is just PMS!</review_text>

            <review_text>Sometimes when getting a message, there is a notification, but the pop up shows someone else's previous message. Or blank. Same thing when selecting a conversation thread in the app. It will show blank, or another contacts messages. Gets confusing. Sometimes messages are received and never got a notification as well. Still like it alot, but I need something that is stable, so I'm shopping around still. Chomp sms is pretty good, except delivery notifications don't work. So who ever fixes the bugs I guess.</review_text>

            <review_title>Great design, incomplete</review_title>
            <review_text>QKSMS looks great and if not for some functional issues with group messages and night view mode, it would likely be able to replace my main texting app. As of now I cannot find a way of viewing everyone on a group message easily, and with a lot of group texts I cannot keep track of the conversations in any reasonable way in QKSMS. A recent update fixed the night mode issues I was having.</review_text>

            <review_text>When writing text you can then not add a picture and convert the message to an mms, you must first delete all of your text and add a picture first. This should be a feature as many sms apps do this (like Handcent). This needs to be emplemented please.</review_text>

            <review_title>It's okay.</review_title>
            <review_text>This app looks sleek and nice and is easy to read. The settings menu is difficult to navigate and could definitely be cleaned up, though. Along with that there are some big drawbacks to using this app. The inability to clear multiple conversations, MMS not working at all, and not being able to copy text from messages really make me want to switch back to the basic messaging app. I'm going to stick it out a little in hopes that it changes, but it sucks losing out on functionality.</review_text>

            <review_text>To be fair my phone is old so that's not the apps fault. However not having a text reminder is a big deal breaker for me. Also texting and navigating the app seems laggy. Speaking of lag I always close apps when I'm done with them, having to constantly reload all the convos and contact pictures makes the experience feel slow. Mind you it's not a very long load but it is still noticeable. I want to love this app unfortunately I'd I think I'll be using textra. Despite using textra I'll be getting qksms+ :)</review_text>

            <review_text>At first, this app seems great! A clean interface with a good amount of customization. Unfortunately, after using it for a while some ugly bugs started showing up. After receiving a message, it occasionally will not show up in the message thread until closing the app and running it again. Additionally, for group chat when a message is received, the notification won't properly load the app when tapped. It loads the person's thread instead of the group message thread. With some bug fixes, this could be great!</review_text>

            <review_title>Good Start, Major Bugs</review_title>
            <review_text>Tried this app out using the reddit giveaway. It's a good start and has all the functionality that most people would like in an SMS app. Unfortunately it has some bugs that preclude it from being the SMS app of choice, most notably, sometimes you'll tap into a conversation, and it will just be blank. All in all, it's a decent start, and I love the community engagement. Good luck!</review_text>

            <review_title>Great App - Some shortcomings</review_title>
            <review_text>I am really enjoying just about everything with this app. It's quick, the heads up notifications work really well and the lot. But there are a couple big issues for me: 1) Auto night mode is not consistent, and the text does not change to a contrasting color without backing out of or force restarting the app. 2) MMS works well, for receiving messages, but they are displayed as this ludicrously small slide show at the top of the screen. Why can't I look at each image individually and zoom?</review_text>

            <review_text>I've only been using this app for about a week now but I really like it. It's a lot like textra but I consider textra a bit more polished and QK still needing some work. I do have a couple of things that I noticed while using QK, it doesn't have a setting for audible reminders if you missed your text and when I send a text but don't close the app I get a pop up of the response on top of the conversation list, why the pop up just add the response to the open conversation. I'm sure QK will keep getting better</review_text>

            <review_title>Needs work.</review_title>
            <review_text>*Mostly* functional and beautiful, this app still lacks core functionality needed to fully replace the stock SMS. It's missing the ability to delete all messages or selectively delete certain messages in a mass. Also missing is the ability to save MMS. The quick reply is nice, but I turned off the auto pop-up function because it would still pop up even if I was in the app. Under some circumstances it would pop up for the current thread I was in. The quick reply should not appear automatically if I'm in the app. The application icon is oversized and doesn't exactly fit material design standards. would be nice if it looked more similar in size to other material design icons. Aside from these few blaring issues I don't have many other gripes about this app. Could be a little bit quicker, but it's not horrible.</review_text>

            <review_text>Group messages are a bit funky (each new message is previewed as no subject and clicking on a notification doesn't take you to the actual group conversation), and it's a bit hard to keep track of everyone with only the first letter in their name appearing. Also, sometimes images will disappear when scrolling. Otherwise, this is a great SMS replacement!</review_text>

            <review_text>A great app with the color customization I have been searching for. Just have two problems: 1. The avatars for my contacts won't show pictures, it only shows the first letter of their name. I have synced contacts with Facebook and LinkedIn, but still no luck. 2. I would love to see a widget. With the same color options as the app, that is what would put it ahead of the competition and would make this a 5 star app.</review_text>

            <review_text>This app does a lot of the things that I wish Google's stock messenger would do (HD contact photos, notification light, nice UI tweaking options, etc) while still maintaining some of the nice features found in both Messenger and Textra.

            <review_title>Nice design, limited functionality</review_title>
            <review_text>I really like the material design and easy navigation. One problem that bothers me is that I can't easily send group messages because there is no batch selection of contacts on the recipients tab. I still need to select the contacts individually which takes more time. A little bit hassle on that group messsaging part, but other than that, it's really good. Hope that it will be fixed on the next update and if done so, I'll totally be loyal on this app.</review_text>

            <review_title>Getting there...</review_title>
            <review_text>Clean, simple, ad-free texting app. However I would like to see the option of batch editing/deleting. Or at least deleting old messages without it scrolling back down to the bottom every time. One major glitch : every picture in every thread is showing as either a picture of my favorite ice cream shop or one of my favorite British actors. Could be worse, but I would like to see the actual pictures. I have to click on the picture and open it in photos to see what it really should be.</review_text>

            <review_text>Okay first off WAY better that all other texting apps I've tried including: go SMS, textra, chomp, evolve, hover chat... The issue is its kind of slow. When I try to go from the conversation to the main screen it goes black and freaks out a bit, its annoying. It would be nice if the popup notification showed the entire conversation right away instead of just the last thing that was sent, annoying to press that button every time.</review_text>

            <review_text>This application is okay, but no matter what I do, I can't send nor receive picture messages (I am with T-Mobile) . This really bothers me. Also, the ugly gradient shadow bothers me, too. I'm on Android 5.0.2 (Samsung Galaxy S6 edge). Can't get the flat style notification bar to show. Probably only for Nexus devices? Then again, I do get the flat style notification bar with other applications. Oh well, these two are the big reasons as to why I will be passing on this application for now. :)</review_text>

If this is addressed, I will update immediately to 5 stars</review_text>

            <review_text>so far, liking it better then Textra but group messaging needs some work and gifs don't play within the thread automatically. It would also be nice for contacts that have a ton of messages if it didn't load all of them at once, but instead loaded maybe hundred and if you scrolled all the way up and tapped load earlier it would then load those messages.</review_text>

There is also no option to retry sending a message if it fails. It's been happening to me once about every 20 messages sent, super annoying.</review_text>

            <review_text>I have yet to find anything that I really don't like about this app, except how you can't match the app font with your system font. I love the customization, especially how the icon matches your theme. :) the sliding panel is actually pretty awesome too. You have to give yourself time to get used to it, but it's a great feature. :) I would suggest adding different notification icons, like with custom colors...especially for per contact settings. But that's all! Great job.</review_text>

            <review_text>I like this app a lot as a replacement for the HTC stock messaging app. My only complaint is that it's a little slow;there's definitely some wait time when you open the app or the quick reply. Otherwise, no complaints!</review_text>

            <review_title>Great but less stable than status quo</review_title>
            <review_text>UI, usability is slick. Love it. However lots if instances where it crashes. There was one non crash bug where ur current conversation/other ones went blank. Hopefully it logs bugs extensively, and maybe it can add a report bug feature? It got a lot less buggy than it was a few months ago but its still the only gripe you can have with this great app. Great work guys!</review_text>

            <review_text>Most of the time that I fully go into the app, it would show me a different thread of messages from someone else under a different contact's name. Which makes me wrong send often; and the only temporary fix I have for it is to go out to the contact list, select someone else and then go out again and go back into the thread I actually want to read to be able to see the proper thread of messages under the correct contact. Edit: also ever since the new update it's been crashing constantly on my Samsung GS6</review_text>

            <review_text>Needs the ability to batch delete messages, rather than long pressing to delete a message you should be able to click multiple messages to delete them all at once. In addition I feel the quick reply pop up needs to be given the option to only pop up when you hit reply from your notifications. This is because it is quite annoying watching a video, playing a game or reading something and the pop up reply window blocks everything. Please consider this change. Thank you !</review_text>

            <review_text>Is it possible though that I'm not getting some text messages because of it? I was using it for a couple of months but it seems that I wasn't receiving a text message once every while. I'm not completely sure if QK SMS was the reason for this malfunction, or a setting that was changed accidentally, I just wanna find what has happenned. I liked QK a lot, I wouldn't have changed it otherwise. Best regards.</review_text>

            <review_text>When I saw the /r/android post when this app was in alpha, I knew I wanted it. The app was great at the time, but there were many bugs. Fast forward to now and it has come a long way, but the bugs still don't allow me to use it full time.</review_text>

            <review_text>I love this texting app! It has everything I'm looking for, the only problem I've run across thus far is that the app won't let me delete photo messages but it will let me delete text messages. (Not whole conversations just individual messages) But this isn't a big deal, I still love the app!</review_text>

            <review_text>The app is really good,makes total sense for developing this app that too with such small app size less than 6 mb wic is half of wat Google messenger. But the prob here is it contains Minor bugs but very irritating ones. Like the notification doesn't get cleared at All. And few more missing feature needs to be added on. Then it a perfect android App.</review_text>

            <review_text>As most of the reviews say, it's a great app but just needs more features. I've found that while in the app, any texts I receive are not shown as notifications. This is annoying as I may not notice someone texted me until way after they do. Also, per contact notifications would be great, and the ability to set custom vibrating patterns. Overall though I'm impressed, good work guys</review_text>

            <review_text>The app has a great look and feel to it but still has some issues to work out.

            <review_text>Very clean and easy to use sms app. However needs emoji, delayed sending, and mms group messaging worked on (mostly just needs contact identifications besides pictures, which are too small to id on smaller screens, like initials or contact names). Otherwise, great app.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really like the look and feel of this app, it does a good job following the Material design. One suggestion for a future feature: be able to view the person's phone number in the conversation that I'm messaging. Example: trying to text a coworker on his work phone number instead of his personal cell phone. Keep up the great work! EDIT 3/27/15 The notification LED feature is not working for me, hopefully this gets resolved! Thanks!</review_text>

            <review_title>Thread avatars need a lot of work. MMS slideshows???</review_title>
            <review_text>Contact avatars are all kinds of buggy with photos of the wrong people getting placed with the wrong threads, group thread avatars are completely uninformative at a glance (Google Messenger does this MUCH better by showing up to 4 participants) and photo messages with text are not viewable - they play like a slideshow. Inability to add multiple photos at once to send and occasional lag are the nails in the coffin. Looks aren't everything - it has to work! Messenger it is, for me; Material Design &amp; bug free.</review_text>

If I put my phone down during and in a conversation I won't know if that person texted me unless I look at my device.

            <review_text>Overall I'm very impressed with this app and despite it resembling Textra SMS, it's very nice! It's much faster and more responsive than Textra and that's what I was looking for! - A few features that should be implemented to make this application perfect. 1. Message delay, for when you goof up a message and want a timer before it's sent so you can't cancel it. 2. Dong automatically make quick reply open. Open quick reply when you press on notification.</review_text>

            <review_title>Beautiful app, buggy out the</review_title>
            <review_text>Between this and google messenger, this has better mechanics and a better ui. Unfortunately, bugs and crashes ruined this app for me. Stock messages loads faster and doesn't freezer as much. Seriously, it takes me two whole minutes to get through one text because midway of writing, it freezes!! Then after I send it boom a second freeze, I hope it's fixed one day but installing it from my m7</review_text>

            <review_title>Great, but MMS needs fixing</review_title>
            <review_text>Just like pretty much every texting app, this has some major MMS issues. On this app it's really weird, I'll get the MMS and have it but can't view it. I have to go to my stock messaging app to see the picture. Please fix, extremely annoying. Other than that, this is my new main messaging app.</review_text>

            <review_text>I only have 2 complaints 1) messages aren't being marked as read, even when I have the message open in the app, since the latest update. 2) Maybe I'm missing it but an in app bug report would be nice so I don't have to discourage people from your app for nit picking.</review_text>

            <review_text>I love the customization of this app. I love the solid-faded tinted status bar upon reaching the top. and I love the classy color. Just one thing, when i'm scrolling down the app gets laggy. and I wish there's an option when on the conversation list i can simply swipe from right to show a delete and call functionality.. Textra is the best reference. But still, stunning messaging app. richer option than others.</review_text>

            <review_text>I enjoy the app and it works well. The themes are simple, but excellent. Also, the pop-up texts are well integrated. I do, however, have an issue with my notifications disappearing immediately if I lock my phone with the app open. Also, (and this is a minor thing) I would like the option to select and delete multiple texts/conversations at once.</review_text>

            <review_title>Excellent app</review_title>
            <review_text>It's quite awesome. The default themes offer a wide range of customization without needing to buy the pro version and it's feature-packed. I switched over from evolveSMS which is one of those who try to reproduce Material, but fail to. This one was well made and looks like Google could have made it. Ever since I downloaded a new messaging app, the feature I wanted was the contacts drawer/tabs like in hello or evolve, so that I can easily swipe through conversations. Textra has the good design but lacks the drawer feature. If I could suggest one thing, though, it's Pushbullet integration. I'm used to it, and evolve had it, and it's a feature that would definitely convince me to ditch the former.</review_text>

            <review_title>MMS problem</review_title>
            <review_text>MMS is really buggy and mostly doesn't work. Can't download pictures. Also there is no animation when sending or receiving texts. Was going to switch from Google Messenger but not anymore unless MMS is fixed. Otherwise it's one of the best sms apps on the Play Store. Developer needs to focus on the main problems first instead of adding new features. Will give 5 stars if this problem is fixed.</review_text>

            <review_title>But no option for selecting multiple conversations n message for deleting.</review_title>
            <review_text>1. It has no batch deleting option for conversations and messages. Which must should be. 2. And also remove the 'Mark conversation as read/unread' option because by this anybody can read the messages easily and can mark as unread. If you can't remove it please hide this option from there and move it to some another menu or give an option in setting for whether to use this option or not.</review_text>

            <review_text>Design - well designed. Functional - encountering many bugs. Notifications can't wake the device, quick reply doesn't pop over the lock screen, which means its not that quick at all. Overall: 2/5, will change review when fixed</review_text>

            <review_text>Buggy, very buggy. Says I have 19 unread messages when I have 0 unread. Will permanently place a pop up notification if I get a picture message and will keep it till I reply. During this time hitting the notification will not take me to the message. Uninstalling for textra atm. I want to like this app since you're a solo dev who posts to people on reddit. Just fix the issues!</review_text>

            <review_text>I like the pop ups and how fast it is to open the full conversion easy and smoothly. Could use a more android l material design but it constantly crashes. Like if I open it, close it and re open it and start trying, it will crash and I have to reopen it, crashes so it doesn't save a draft fix and will be 5 star buii</review_text>

            <review_title>GREAT app, but...</review_title>
            <review_text>I really love this app! I've loved it since I've started using it. I am a QKSMS+ user. However, one major issue for me. MMS messaging... I group message with a group of friends constantly. And for some reason, I don't get notified for ANY MMS messages. So I never know when they're texting back in the group message or when I'm receiving a picture message. And on top of that, it CONSTANTLY refreshes the messages when I am in the app looking at the group messages. It's really irritating. I know the developer hates them, but I will be switching to Textra to test them out until this is fixed... :/</review_text>

            <review_text>1) Needs option to open a camera from the attachment button to quickly snap and send a photo. 2) User should be able to turn off the vibration and/or toast that initiate from delivery reports. 3) Colored text bubbles need to have dark text when the current theme color is very bright/light. 4) Being able to swipe to the left on any conversation to slide it into view would feel very nice and consistent with the swipe-to-left gesture that takes you back to the conversation list.</review_text>

            <review_text>Started using this out of curiosity. Very attractive. However, this app is terrible in every aspect when it comes to group chats and the notification system. You'll see. Force quit more than expected but that can be fixed. And when you use the search and click on a message result, it doesn't take you to that message. As much as I wanted to live this beautifully designed app. It pushed me away with all these bugs and flaws that forced me back to Textra..</review_text>

            <review_title>A great app but one thing I wish they'd fix</review_title>
            <review_text>I've been with the app since the beginning and I understand the difficulties with MMS but I wish already received images wouldn't show up all the same. Other than this I love the app.</review_text>

            <review_text>This is my only gripe. I miss group messages and this leaves me out of the loop. I donated during alpha and still hope that this will be fixed someday.</review_text>

            <review_text>Is it possible for you to add a feature which hides private messages like the stock MIUI SMS app? If yes I'll surely buy it! :))) Thanks for this beautiful app ;)</review_text>

            <review_text>This is my favorite sms client, i love it. Problem is its buggy at time for exaple whenever i get a text from someone while using the phone the quick reply function of the app shows the last person i talked to rather than the sender of the message this needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Thankd for an amazing app</review_text>

            <review_title>Just one suggestion!</review_title>
            <review_text>To start, I absolutely love this app, great work! First time I've been able to stick with an SMS app without switching back and forth! Just one suggestion to improve my experience and make it 100% perfect, can you make it so that the bubble length can be changed? So that it doesn't have to go all the way to the other side of the screen?</review_text>

            <review_text>but doesn't handle group messages at all. Force quits every time I try to open one. When it does accomplish them, the avatar associated with the conversation is of a random contact not at all involved in the conversation. I have yet to find a 3rd party app that successfully handles group messages. That includes Google Hangouts.</review_text>

            <review_text>Omg I downloaded this app and LOVED the material UI. That's where my love stopped. The m and n keys stopped working on my keyboard and I kept getting a persistent message that said message not found or expired. Thought that was the worst of it until my brother called me and cursed me out because my phone was sending him and his gf the same message over 125 times. Wish I was making this story up.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really appreciate the good work but it would have been real convenient if you guys give lockscreen notification options when the sensitive option is active in the privacy settings on lollipop (like hangouts give the lock screen notifications, its like 2 new messages from two conversations.) Plus i dont get my screen turned on upon receiving the text on my nexus 5. Furthermore please give the whole conversation on pop up. I would really appreciate if you grant me with a few updates satisfying me. :)</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is slick and beautiful. One issue however is the failed text messages. I have a handful of text messages buried in conversations that failed to send and there is no presumable way to access them and delete or even remove the indicator. The indicator is the same colour and in the same location as the  new message indicator and I just wish I could remove them! If I wanted to it would be hours of sifting up through conversations that have been ongoing for ages. Please help!</review_text>

            <review_text>Transition are great! UI is super friendly, and I like this BETTER than Textra. But did I pay $1.99 to only get automatic night mode? That was kind of surprising...</review_text>

            <review_text>App started to get a little choppy and pop up text notifications would display wrong names at times.. This would confuse me as to who I was actually texting. Also brand new text messages sometimes would not show up until I refreshed thread by going to another thread and then back.. Annoying... Textra is better</review_text>

            <review_text>This is by far the best SMS experience I've ever had, great job developers for creating a wonderful app, even better that the famous Textra and Google Messenger. One thing to add is the option to just have transparent navigation bars, so the background on the nav bars match your background. &#128076;&#128076;&#128076;&#128076;</review_text>

            <review_title>Still no character counter</review_title>
            <review_text>I participated in the app beta and brought up the matter then, but I see that QKSMS has been released and it's still not done. The problem: When I compose an SMS, this app still doesn't display a character counter. How am I supposed to know if I'm getting close to the character limit? I'm not interested in having the app break up long messages into multiple SMS. I just need to know how much space I have left so I can make the most of one SMS.</review_text>

            <review_text>This app looks nice and functions well but it's missing some features that I use with Chomp SMS.

            <review_text>Love the app and its material touches and such. Just a small suggestion. Could you allow for multiple selection of conversations? Because I tend to go on a deleting spree like a lot of people I know and being able to select multiple conversations and delete them with just one click is almost a necessity with my messaging apps. Having to delete them individually and confirm deletion is kind of a drag. Also there happens to be a few bugs left when it comes to sending new messages</review_text>

The quick text box pops up with the previous texts instead of the incoming, and the sync between the full window and the quick window with most recent message in a feed does not keep up. I paid for this app and I'm uninstalling. But I LOVE the simplicity and the UI. Keep working on it!!</review_text>

            <review_text>Great app, I love the customization available (status bar tint, contact image display) but the only thing that is a little irritating is how messages are shown a little bit on the right side rather than a whole home screen dedicated to all your messages. Other than that, this is great!</review_text>

            <review_text>If someone sends an MMS with multiple images they arrive as a slideshow (possibly only when the message is from iPhone) but they don't do that in messenger so I'm guessing this is a qksms thing.</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is borderline unusable. Sends quick replies to wrong recipients, displays blank conversation windows, sometimes you can see a new message on notification bar but not in the conversation window, problems with auto night-mode switching (black text on dark window), no multi-select, sometimes can't copy texts without any apparent reason, etc. Never should have gotten out of alpha testing. App is updated less frequently since and dev(s) don't even address the problems in updates. The ones that were supposed to be fixed are not really fixed, they just occur less frequently.</review_text>

            <review_text>Love the look and flow of this app, but my only gripes are: 1) lack of notifications for group mms. When I receive a group text, the only way I can tell that it's been received is by going into the app itself. All the notifications work for single person texts only. 2) frequently the quick text reply defaults to the previous sender, so if I get a text from person B, the quick text reply is for person A. If these issues were fixed, I'd definitely switch fully to QK!</review_text>

            <review_text>When I open the app, a notification appears in in the notification screen that, depending on the conversation I was previously in, displays either an empty message from nobody or my previous message.

            <review_text>First and foremost the app is gorgeous. But has extreme issues. In my opinion it should still be in beta. Notifications barely work not making any sounds while music or any other special is playing, won't turn on my screen even though I have it checked, fails to state who is texting despite the number being saved, doesn't inform me of MMS, messages, and keeps saying message failed to download in group chats. I really want to love this app but beauty is only skin deep.</review_text>

            <review_text>It's simple and has a great color scheme that I love!. The mark as read option in the pull down menu is awesome! It's fast too! I like the pop up message up option, nothing new, but very efficient. However I've recently gone back to my old messenger because sometimes I click on a thread and it is blank, and I get random quit unexpectedly messages. Not a huge problem but I use my phone for work and need to be extremely efficient. Trying it again though!</review_text>

            <review_text>Very fast and nice messaging app. One consistent problem so far is that the incoming message notification in the drop down notification bar does not always show the name of who the incoming message is from, nearly half the time it shows only the phone number. Will continue to use the app as it is fast and responsive, looking forward to a fix on this minor issue tho. This occurs on Android 5.0</review_text>

            <review_text>Installed after seeing it on /r/android and loved it initially. Having MMS issues, though. Whenever I try to send a picture it adds a second 'person' to the list that is just a 3 number chain and then doesn't send. Also issues with contact pictures displaying wrong in group chats. Keeping it updated as I watch for these fixes but not using it as my texting app yet.</review_text>

            <review_text>This is a great app, and I would certainly give it the maximum amount of stars if it didn't struggle with working properly with android wear. I made this my default SMS app on my Nexus 4, but it did not often push text messages through to my LG G watch, causing me to miss out on important and timely messages. Additionally, when I would get an sms sent my LG G watch, it wouldn't say from whom but display their mobile number only. Until these issues are corrected, I will hold off on purchasing the full app.</review_text>

            <review_title>Great overall - group message problems</review_title>
            <review_text>Love the fluidity and simplicity but when receiving group texts, the notification at the top will not go away, if I swipe it away it just returns, and if I check read it does nothing. If I click the message the app opens a blank conversation with no one. Only way to make it go away is to open the app and find and enter that group conversation. Great app other than this but if it persists I can't use it on a daily basis its too frustrating</review_text>

            <review_text>. On my s4 running CM11, it often fails to show last text message in texting conversation, have to go to list of texts to see it. Also if I get a photo from someone not in my contacts, I have a Hidden Sender error message in my notification bar that only goes away if app is reinstalled. Wish these things were fixed. It's a lovely app otherwise</review_text>

            <review_text>This is a great app, but it does have some UI issues. I pretty regularly see it get confused &amp; show the wrong contact-photo/avatar for people in conversations. A restart of the app always seems to fix it, at least for a while. It also seems to happen more often in the summary window when multiple people are involved (shows the avatar of someone not in the conversation).</review_text>

            <review_text>Very good looking sms app. Simple and clean but the settings section is so confusing, I can't be able to toggle them the way I want. I had to go back to the list to see my changes. My suggestion is to make setting more user friendly like add buttons in front of options. And it connects to mobile data even when I had it turned off. And if you can please add SMS counter. No other sms app has one that can count them correctly.</review_text>

            <review_title>Awesome app but slow performance</review_title>
            <review_text>I find it really lags when i open the app or select a new conversation. I am typically looking at 2-5 seconds for the app to load and when selecting different conversation threads. Also pleae allow me to open the camera in the app to take pictures and send them via MMS. Otherwise beautiful app with buttery smooth animations.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really like this app, true black for amoled is a very nice touch. I am however seeing a bug where an sms thread can be empty if my phone is locked when I receive a message and the app was open when I had locked my phone. If I back out of the app and go back into it the thread will be populated again. Let me know if you want me to pull a log cat or anything, I'm running 4.4.4 on a moto x 2nd gen.</review_text>

            <review_text>I often get messages with only phone numbers in the notification. Sharing a photo from the gallery, the contact is entered with the area code as a separate string of text, which creates a new messaging thread separate from the thread for the actual contact. When you first open a messaging thread avatars will sometime not load or will be wrong. Program doesnt reflect contact updates. Not getting notifications for group MMS replies. Visible refresh loading a conversation. Can't turn off analytics.</review_text>

            <review_text>the app is great and i would love to keep using it, tho i would like to see more color varieties in customization. my biggest gripes however are the blank pages created during screen rotations and the fact that there seems to be perhaps a glitch? according to my battery page qksms has kept my phone awake for over 17hrs, which doesnt make sense at all. tho its a relatively recent occurence its run my battery down and i may switch back to textra for the time being.</review_text>

            <review_text>I used textra before this and while it is similar, qksms is better. I love the changes I can make to the appearance. There are some bugs that keep me from loving it though. When I open it from my home screen, it often opens to a blank page and I have to swipe left to see my messages. The quick reply feature is wonderful, however I don't like that I have to mark as read to get the notification to go away...I already read it. I would like to be able to integrate personalized tones for different contacts.</review_text>

            <review_text>Group messaging takes forever to receive and when it does come it either shows the text and then disappear, failed to even download, or I get them in the wrong order/receive them twice. Contact photo sometimes shows on the wrong contact. Quick reply shows a previous text versus the text that just came in. Maybe include a feature where there is no pop-up when watching a video. There are more bugs but right now, these are my biggest ones. Layout and design is my favorite out of all the text apps. Please fix!</review_text>

            <review_text>...because I'm an active redditor and the dev hangs out in the android sub, so I like supporting fellow redditors, but it's way too buggy for me to keep using. I'm going to send an email outlining everything I've experienced because I don't have enough room here, but bottom line is I can't rely on the app to show my incoming messages, so it's a no-go. I can't be missing important texts because they disappear after the pop-up goes away!! (Note 4 user here...)</review_text>

            <review_text>Love the look and feel of the app as well as all the customization. There are a couple bugs though that made me switch back to my default messaging app such as poor integration with lightflow a notification handling app. Also, with Android L, I would get 2 notifications when the screen was on. One for the quick reply and one for the actual notification from the Android OS. Other than that it is a fantastic app going in the right direction.

            <review_text>I overall liked the app, but not being able to choose which people to add to your group messaging and having to type each name in kind of frustrates me. If you can make this possible pls add it. It'd be a lot easier to group message</review_text>

            <review_text>This is a very good app, but it needs more transitions. Like when you get a message have it slide in instead of appear out of nowhere, and same goes for sending a message have it transition from where you right it to where it is sent.</review_text>

            <review_title>This is a fantastic app with a few annoying bugs</review_title>
            <review_text>I love this app and can't wait to see it evolve and improve. Just a few things. I wish MMS or picture messages should be handled like other SMS apps where you can swipe through previous picture messages from the same contact rather than it opening separately. Having a bug where looking at a conversation and rotating will wipe the screen and change the to compose message rotating the screen back does nothing to remedy it. Kind of annoying. I love the app.</review_text>

            <review_text>the best messaging replacement app I've seen. I'm running the latest HTC rom on my One M7, so the UI is already looking more material and similar to Lollipop, but might not get Lollipop until Feb 2015. So this app makes my messages match with the feel of the rest of my phone, and the customization is great for a free version of the app.</review_text>

            <review_text>The app is great and IMO feels better to use than any of the alternatives. However the thing that stops me from making this my default SMS app: no option to display full names in group chats, no option to hide no subject line from group texts, and its be nice to have the call button in group texts list the ppl in the chat and their phone numbers instead of calling a odd 6 digit number. These things are present in Textra and I find them quite helpful.</review_text>

            <review_text>I'm using this one the phone in the review_title and I want to love this app. I really do. The developer is responsive and it looks beautiful, but I have never seen an app completely lock up my entire phone. It wouldn't turn off and the screen was on, and I had to go to work. It routinely locks up the keyboard, crashes all the time, and stutters more than my car. I will happily change this to 5 if it gets fixed.</review_text>

            <review_text>Group messages don't always come through. Pictures don't always come through. And we the users should be able to select and send grouped pics all from the app. Similar to Google's new messenger app.</review_text>

            <review_title>Needs iOS Emoji Support</review_title>
            <review_text>I really want to make this my default SMS app. The only thing holding me back switching from Textra is the lack of iOS emoji support. A lot of my friends have iPhones and it's often hard to figure out what an Android emoji will translate to on iOS.</review_text>

            <review_text>One big thing it is missing for me is texting to a predefined group already set up within Android contacts. Not exactly uncommon, Google's own SMS app skipped adding that. Still, a big feature for me in an ever day SMS app. Hope to see it soon. Otherwise, great look and it actually does feel different then Textra to me. Possible every day app down the road.</review_text>

            <review_text>The app looks nice and performs well, and I really enjoy the interface customization. However, I have had issue with getting the notification LED color to be green, and not red on my particular device. I'm also consistently not notified of new Group or MMS messages. Overall, it's been a nice alternative to hangouts, and I'll be using it for the foreseeable future. Hope to see continued development and improvement.</review_text>

            <review_text>Looks great and runs well. Has a night mode and color options, default theme looks good and it wasn't as difficult as I expected to get MMS working. Love it Edit: I've had some issues since my previous review. I've had the problem some others have mentioned where at times messages show up with phone numbers instead of contact names. In addition, I got a group MMS that would spam me with the notification but didn't show up in QKSMS at all. I had to change back to Hangouts, read it, and then switch my default back to QKSMS to get rid of it and the message still didn't show up. Lowering my score to a 4 because of the general bugginess but I'm going to keep using it.</review_text>

            <review_text>Very nice app and functionality. A bit glitchy on my s4 for example the side tray still tries to pop up when disabled.. Unable to delete some messages. Minor niggles for an otherwise beautiful app. Will rate higher in future updates I believe...... Three days in I have uppers my rating. Still got glitches during transitions but I love the functions I will stick with this. This is in my opinion better than googles new app which is equally attractive but trounced on features.</review_text>

            <review_text>Please add the option to have the keyboard auto open when you go into a conversation. It's annoying to have to tap the text field every time to bring it up. Also, the new message icon in the status bar should clear when you view the conversation but doesn't. Other than that, great work!</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is one of the nicest looking SMS apps available, seemingly combining the best bits of hello SMS and Textra SMS - minimalist, beautiful, and functional. Bugs to Work out: 1) Avatars don't always load correctly 2) Notification shows message count when that option is not selected, rather than showing a preview of the incoming message. What would make it 5 stars: 1) Fix above bugs 2) .gif support 3) secondary color / backgrounds.</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is just awesome and full of features I wanted in a single app. The interface with tabbed conversations, the new button from Lollipop Messenger, the overall animations are nice. I would rate it 5 stars if it had the option to set custom ringtones for individual contacts. I also noticed few bugs like there is no delete confirmation dialog box, please add it as its important. Also, the search button works like expected but, clicking on the search result should open that particular message instead of taking to the bottom of that conversation. Keep up the good work!</review_text>

            <review_text>It keeps asking me for my APN info. I'm on Verizon and other VZW users don't seem to be having an issue. Also very slow to boot, but quite speedy within the app when loaded. HTC One M8.</review_text>

            <review_title>Awesome but a few fixes need to be made.</review_title>
            <review_text>The design is beautiful! However the delete message button doesn't even work and I wish when I clicked the menu button better options would come up. Definitely a potential and deserving 5 star app though.</review_text>

            <review_text>App is really good so far it took me away from textra one glaring issue to me is that it doesn't open the conversation you hit from notification bar it just opens the app. So if you had another conversion open in the app you might end up replying to someone you didn't want to.</review_text>

            <review_text>I have an S4 on ATT. I never get MMS SBD group texts with this app. It is really beautiful though. I use Textra because I don't have these issues.</review_text>

            <review_text>Very stylish. I look forward to seeing more functionality as the app develops. For me, Evolve sms, is the top dog. It has great features and I love the smooth sending animations. Eye candy for sure, but an important part of the mobile phone expierience in 2014. Fluidity is an important aesthetic! I wish you all the best!</review_text>

            <review_text>A few features I feel the app would benefit from but for a beta this is great EDIT: For example, being able to have the facebook profile pictures of contacts set as the contact's portrait in QKSMS. This works in the stock messaging app but I don't see that capability in this app.</review_text>
