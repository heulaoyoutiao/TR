            <review_text>ownCloud app is completely not responding when there is another layer eg. when the Twilight application makes the screen red. Since ownCloud is used for synchronizing files, why can't I move the app to SD card?</review_text>

            <review_text>Really disappointed with the app due to the following: (1) it crashes all the time.. like literally all. the. time. (2) it doesn't sync files when they're changed via phone (3) after downloading some files to the phone, they just disappeared from the cloud. Concluding, there are severe stability and robustness issues, while necessary features are missing.</review_text>

            <review_title>Absolutely brilliant, and the best cloud-storage solution!</review_title>
            <review_text>ownCloud is perhaps one of the very best Open Source projects to date... Though it is important to note that much of its functionality depends of how you implement ownCloud (e.g. How much space you allocate, the infrastructure and hosting you utilize, etc). In saying this, the official Android application for ownCloud looks great and seems to work well, leaving little reason to look at other cloud storage solutions, particularly if you're concerned about privacy and security... Very highly recommended.</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is effectively useless. You cannot sync files larger than about 2MB. Because it stops syncing when the app is terminated, every time your phone goes to sleep or you switch apps, all your syncing will fail. The OwnCloud app doesn't resume partial uploads, or retry failed uploads... it just lets everything fail. Even if you retry, you'll just hit the same problem again.</review_text>

            <review_title>Still no online picture viewer. Not a Dropbox replacement.</review_title>
            <review_text>Owncloud as a cloud server is wonderful, for a desktop. The app however leaves us a little behind as far a photo storage goes. (Not the only use for own cloud but what drove me to try it.). The idea that you can upload photos to save space on your phone, but then you have to download them back again to see them seems, well bonkers. Hopefully it's just an in development issue waiting to be addressed. Just tried viewing pics through browser and it works great so here's hoping.</review_text>

            <review_text>Ich bin sehr froh, meine Daten nicht mehr mit Google teilen zu müssen :) Besitze ein Samsung S4 und habe bisher keine Probleme feststellen können, so wie in anderen Rezensionen beschrieben. Ich finde alles Top bis auf die alles markieren Funktion, aber die kommt sicherlich bald... :)</review_text>

            <review_title>Looking for features?</review_title>
            <review_text>If you are looking for features this is not the right app for you. It seems like the app wasn't updated for ages. It's not possible to sync a whole folder which makes it exhausting to sync anything. You have to open a folder and click each file seperately. Also it is not possible to sync periodical or on file change. However the app connect to your owncloud server as a charm and seem to download / upload single files well. Not exciting for advances users though.</review_text>

            <review_text>I was hesitant to pay for an app that did not know that would suit my needs in the first place. Well, after I set my Owncloud on a rpi and downloaded this app on my Android phone, everything works like a charm. My photos now are getting backed up automatically. If only there was an option to delete original files from phone after having been backed up.</review_text>

            <review_text>I am not missing a real feature, but I found a imho serious bug: When having multiple accounts, your photos are being uploaded automatically to the currently active account!!! Missing directories are created. So you may end up having your private photos being uploaded to your company or whatever your second account is about :-O</review_text>

            <review_text>Why there is even a retry failed option? Shouldn't it keep trying uploading until successful? If I miss the retry failed option and have the bad luck of accidentally chose the next option (clear failed) I loose track of what is synced and not... Can't believe I paid for this while there are free options that are better.</review_text>

            <review_text>Still needs improvements. Everytime an automatic upload fails it does not restart. This is specially annoying if you have a slow connection. I have to go to the app and retry everything. This is bad because I run the risk of pressing clear failed and then I don't know what was uploaded and what wasn't. It is a huge problem if I have a lot of files to be backed up. It makes me not trust the app and think it's unreliable. A quick way to notice what files are uploaded would also be nice.</review_text>

            <review_title>Excellent, needed app. Updated</review_title>
            <review_text>This is a great companion to an Owncloud server. I love the way it lets you choose to DL and sync. Two needed 'features': 1) allow config of local (phone) data dir (e.g. sdcard-ext) 2) don't automatically copy uploaded files to local data dir; uploading for a reason, don't need two copies on my phone without intending it. Will bump to 5 stars with those important changes. Nice work! Update June 16 : this app is now a well oiled machine of productivity. Thanks!</review_text>

            <review_text>Installed the latest version of the app and after a few hours of having it on my phone, see that my phone battery has dropped steeply. On checking the battery settings it shows that owncloud app was active and kept the phone awake for 2 hours. All I did was install the app login to my account. Why was the app keeping my phone awake for 2 hours?? Immediately uninstalled the app and after a few hours notice that battery was no longer draining as before. I am really disappointed with this app now.</review_text>

            <review_text>The whole cloud thing is really great. But this client still lacks reliability: the pics backup feature is really a killer one but when something goes wrong during sync, pics won't be backup at all. There must be a way afterwards to see which pics have not been uploaded &amp; propose to do so again. This should also be available to any file (backup files you generate on your phone for instance). And yes i only use this app to backup my phone on my Owncloud. Keep on doing &#128521;!</review_text>

            <review_text>Pulling up a photo to show a friend takes ages. There is no way that I know of to set default sorting for a folder.

            <review_text>Using it for a privat and a work related owncloud server. Unfortubaterrly server switching is done in settings which makes it a bit cumbersome.

            <review_text>Crap! This client cannot connect to the owncloud instance, even when doing so through the web browser works. it sucks. Maybe because it is a self-sertified certificate for the site? But the client should be able to deal with that, since many private hosts for _owncloud_ will be exactly that.</review_text>

I've never had any issues, nor have any clients reported any problems completing tasks with this app. Typical use is uploading files for pickup on PC, and downloading files to mobile device that were uploaded to owncloud via PC, etc. Not much experience with the auto-upload features.</review_text>

            <review_text>Auto upload does not work on either of my clients, the asp seems to be running in its own time zone - not the same time zone as either the client or the server. So recently (manually) uploaded files are displayed with a modification date in the future. WebDAV browser on client, web browser and terminal on server all show correct date. All I really need is to have my photos uploaded. Es file explorer is better at everything else. Unfortunately the app doesn't do the one thing I need.</review_text>

            <review_text>Yesterday I changed the Webserver certificate and on all my desktop clients the applications prompted that the cert has changed, do you want to trust it?, but not on the mobile app. The Synchronisation stopped working and I couldn't upload files to the server. The solution was to start adding a new user and click trust the certificate on this stage. Pleas fix this problem.</review_text>

            <review_text>As an app developer I can see alot of room for improvement. The most important is auto sync when you are connected to wifi only. Setup a time for auto sync. I.E it will start syncing at midnight. Specify specific sync directories.</review_text>

            <review_title>Better than previous versions... still some issues.</review_title>
            <review_text>In general I like this app and it seems more stable than previous versions. However, there are some features lacking that are real show stoppers. First, even though, the app is installed on my SD card ,it insists on storing downloaded files on the built-in memory on my phone. Secondly it would be really nice to be able to select a folder to keep in sync between the phone and the server. Thanks</review_text>

            <review_text>Simple, does it's job. This is now working without login problems, compared to older versions. I use it on a phone with Cyanogenmod 12. The Instant upload feature works quite reliable. When browsing for images, it now has a picture preview, and the ability to download complete directories, which is very helpful.</review_text>

            <review_text>Limited ability to sync between device and OwnCloud. Can not select folders to sync, only pics or movies. These devices are not toys. Doesn't provide for use of SD card storage, requiring manual file moves to SD card after download. Sort of defeats the purpose of the app. Highly likely just a port of an iOS app to android without understanding how android works.</review_text>

            <review_title>Mobile sync is a joke</review_title>
            <review_text>Android app needs serious tweaking as upload takes 10 times longer than through web interface. Moreover it's not possible to transfer files larger than 100MB as it always fails at around 25% for no reason. I've just performed a test and a 400MB file which failed to upload after 30min using app, uploaded in less than 4mins via web interface (both attempts have been made on the same android device and connection). Owncloud is great, but I'm begging you - please fix the app!</review_text>

            <review_text>All in all a very well put together app. Unfortunately it could use a little work: the app should just upload the files i choose instead of copying the files to a different folder, and then uploading, thus using up unnecessary space; the pin security option lags and I have to enter it slowly, making it susceptible to shoulder surfing; whenever I upload something and lose network connectivity, it just gives an error instead of pausing the upload and continuing at a later time.</review_text>

            <review_text>It works, but compared to Dropbox or Drive it's super minimal. Suggestions if I may: 1. Integrate into the file open menu, so that I can open owncloud files from arbitrary apps, and 2. Provide an option to delete the locally downloaded copy of a file, that seems to be missing and is sometimes annoying.</review_text>

            <review_text>When you really need a file it works. But this app is NOT FOR DAILY USE! Al files are directly downloaded instead of having a choice what to do. All files are downloaded on mobile and no choice to move the owncloud folder to sdcard. Can't remove files from mobile from whithin client. Really dissapointed!</review_text>

            <review_text>New documents and their updates made on the owncloud by Mac always work properly. Some of the edits in documents for e.g., on Android clients (V. 1.7.2) and Macs (V. 1.8.4 build 2531) are updated to the owncloud server. The Mac clients see the edits from Mac and Androids, but Androids do not get updated. Saving text files under other name do not appear in the same client that creates it, neither on the owncloud server. Manual updates of Android clients impossible. Saving to ext-SD not possible. I want a REFUND! I's useless.</review_text>

            <review_text>I didn't understand how owncloud intends to be used before purchasing this app. I was excited by the idea of having a repository where I could automatically upload media and other files to use on any of my devices. Then I learned that owncloud automatically syncs both to the cloud and from the cloud, including syncing deletions. I don't have enough storage space on my phone to save all the movies on my NAS permanently. And I definitely can't risk deleting all copies of pictures of my baby accidentally.</review_text>

            <review_text>It's missing critical functionality. There's no easy way to upload existing photos to the owncloud server. I figured I'd just use the upload files feature and do it manually. But apparently there's NO WAY to select all files in a folder. You have to click EACH FILE one by one to select them. I have over 500 photos in one folder! Seriously, no one though a select all button would be a useful feature?</review_text>

            <review_text>This mobile app works well if the server you're hosting ownCloud with is correctly configured. A large majority of the bad reviews posted here are results of incorrectly configured server settings. I use this application on a daily basis, and sync hundreds of files. It's been rock solid during my use. Supports encryption, and functions similar to Dropbox, Google Drive, or any of those other cloud based data storage and sync services. One complaint is that if you'd set a file to be synced upon changes, the setting is only respected if you launch the file through ownCloud. If it could watch the files that are downloaded, selected for sync and upload the modified file upon editing it with actual app that is designed to open in , as opposed to having to go through ownCloud each time, this app would have five stars.</review_text>

            <review_text>Generally could be a useful app - or was, if it would work. Seems as with the recent changes it only uploads if I take a picture and OwnCloud can instantly connect. I've sync over WiFi only, and my OwnCloud is private, so I can only upload at home. This includes, pictures taken somewhere never get synced at all - but those are the pictures I'd like to sync.</review_text>

            <review_text>App is a light version of the desktop sync client and not always intuitive but does the job. Needs some love for bidirectional sync (e.g. local keepass database update sometimes wont trigger updating the server file, have not found out why) and interface cleanup (bit messy) but the app is solid and does the job. Add selective folder sync and android calendar/contact sync and you are golden.</review_text>

            <review_title>クライアントとしては機能がかなり貧弱</review_title>
            <review_text>ES File ExplorerがWebDAVのクライアントになれるのでそちらの方がずっとマシです。しばしばディレクトリの列挙に失敗してエラーも出さない㿁ファイルごとに設定しないと自動で同期してくれない㿁お気に入りなどがないのでアプリが再起動したらルートから辿らなければならない、専用アプリなのに画像を縮小してロード時間を減らすなどの機能もない㿂オープンソースだから自分でいじればいいのでしょうが、無料の競合が存在しているのでそれも厳しいものがあります〿</review_text>

            <review_text>I bought this app thinking it would do wonders with our owncloud server. Really........I paid for an app thats free with another name. OCLUD and another german APP does the same thing. Ocloud is version 1.7.0 and the paying app owncloud is version 1.71. Both do the same. DOnt waste your cash on an app they sell when you can get it for free. One star is the lowest I would give it -10 for selling something thats free. Buyer Beware.</review_text>

            <review_text>I have ownCloud 8.0.3 installed on a QNap TS-451 Vs 4.1.3. Everything works great and have iOS clients installed and working as they should. I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tablet S4 and installed ownCloud app Vs 1.7.1 from Google Play store. This app failed to sync to ownCloud after trying for hours to rectify the problem I downgraded to Vs 1.7.0 and everything works fine. Great app, but upgrade fails.</review_text>

            <review_title>Poor development</review_title>
            <review_text>Everything you upload on owncloud gets copied to a different folder on your SD card. This bug has been worked on since January 2014 and is still not fixed when it literally DOUBLES how much space your files take. This makes me doubt the reliability of the developers.</review_text>

            <review_text>Refuses to connect to my 8.0.2 (stable) server with either my OnePlus (5.0.2) or Nexus 9 (5.0.1) When I try and connect to my server I receive the following error after I've clicked OK for the certificate: Unknown error occurred! I have also tried setting the server to not enforce HTTPS but I get the same error. (fyi I have tried connecting via host name and ip address, same result) Both devices have been wiped using recovery and had a fresh Lolipop image flashed to them. Am I the only one with this issue?

            <review_text>Why is this program DUPLICATING everything you upload with InstantUpload? I have big SD-card for images and videos for a reason and since this is installed on phone memory it will fill up the whole memory. (4.4.4 restrict applications to write to sd-card so moving program there won't work either)</review_text>

            <review_text>The app has improved exponentially since you don't have to download the entire file tree with every update. It updates as you browse through your folders. The only problem with this is that I'm not sure that I'll be able to keep my hands warm in the winter using this app. I guess I'll have to find a new battery drain. The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars is because there is no setting to keep apps updated by default, or at least I can't seem to find one.

            <review_text>Every single time the app is updated I need to re-enter my server credentials which is ridiculous. Also this latest update broke HTTPS support when SSL3 is disabled to mitigate the POODLE vulnerability. I keep getting SSL initialization errors when it works just fine from the web.</review_text>

            <review_title>Fail / Retry?</review_title>
            <review_text>It's hard to fault a product so feature rich that is made available for free, and the ownCloud server is great in this respect. The app, however, which IS a paid-for product is a disappointment. When uploading a file over 3G it all too often fails part way through, then hangs forever at, say, 67%. Or, it will know it has failed and when you click on the notification status it then just opens the ownCloud folder that your upload /would/ of gone to had it worked. The annoyance is not simply having a Retry option to re-upload again without having to task kill the app and finding your file to upload. Fix that and you're onto a winning app. Two stars for the app, 10+ for the web back-end.</review_text>

It only uploads and downloads. - Uploads fail frequently and the app force closes a lot. - Does not have an option to download a whole folder. - Does not have multi-select to upload/ download several files at once. - If you are not online when you take a picture, that file doesn't get uploaded. - No thumbnails for pictures. - Share works really well.</review_text>

            <review_text>Well, what can I say....I used this app in past with two different Owncloud instances on two different Raspberry Pi installations and it worked flawless. However, with my Note 4 the app crashes every time I try to connect to the Raspberry Pi instances. With other Devices, Samsung S4 and the Galaxy Tab 2, I have no problem connecting to Owncloud through the App. I have tried several times to reach out to their support team but have not received anything back except for for basic troubleshooting. After I asked them if the Note 4 had issues using the app all I got back was complete silence. What a shame! I gave this app 3 stars because I can use other devices, however my main device , Samsung Note 4, is not working with app. PLEASE OWNCLOUD DO SOMETHING!!!!</review_text>

            <review_text>If this is the same app that's free on fdroid, I've been using it on my Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 for months. It's crashed a few times, mostly the way 7, but I love it. It's a great way to get files between my desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone. It even plays music within the app without having to open a media player (not always a plus: it does only one song at a time). I wish it were easier to switch between accounts but it's not that bad. I like how it can back up my photos to my server without having to go through Google. Especially useful for work photos that I don't want to share with a third party.</review_text>

            <review_title>Not what I expected</review_title>
            <review_text>Most likely a killer app which deserves a prize, but... wasn't expecting that I needed my own private webhosting account. Not what I was looking for. Not interested in an app which needs so much configuration, too much configuration takes out the productivity. So as much as I would like to give this app a full house of stars because it's probably just awesome, I give it only 3 due to the info wasn't clear enough to me about how this app functions and then that it needs your own webhosting, which is probably great, but not that great for me. Perhaps others think it's great, but that doesn't apply to me. So, I'm sorry for my bad review and actually would like a refund although I think your app is awesome, just not awesome for me.</review_text>

            <review_title>Works well overall but could be better</review_title>
            <review_text>Files you download wind up deep in the owncloud folder. You should have an option to download files to /sdcard/download or any location you choose. If you have your photos automatically upload on wifi, if you are not on wifi when you take your pics, they do not upload when you connect (like dropbox does). Makes the feature useless. Fix those 2 things and I would give it 5 starts.</review_text>

            <review_text>The description specifically says this app syncs from the owncloud server. I have not been able to find file sync capability in this app. I need to have real, live, always up to date copies of my owncloud files ON MY PHONE at all times and if I change one of the files on my phone I need it to automatically sync back to the owncloud server.</review_text>

            <review_text>I love using owncloud. Its the perfect app on PC for collaboration. Regrettably nothing works in this app. I can't connect to a server with this app and therefore nothing works. Not really accepted for a paid app. I would expect to at least be able connect Even if it was buggy, but paying for an app where nothing works isn't even a product in alpha stage. I'm sad to say that this purchase is not worth it.</review_text>

            <review_title>Great software.</review_title>
            <review_text>Once you get it set up correctly (I broke it a few times) this program is awesome. Currently using one account for work, calender sync, user and part manuals plus guides for new uaers. Also handed out accounts for the family. 22 users so far, servers been up 4 months now. No issues. Edited the configuration files to get around issues syncing files over 500mb. Works flawless now.</review_text>

            <review_text>Still takes too many steps to simply share a large file link. Hoping for one step that handles: upload large file to ownCloud, make it shared, generate link, paste link into chosen share method (e.g. sms or email). Again, look at the competition for ideas, they seem to get it with everything but the BYOS part.</review_text>

            <review_title>Good start but need a lot of additional func to be good.</review_title>
            <review_text>Some obvious and simple needs should have been easy to anticipate. A select all option when navigating for files to upload for instance. Don't make you users select several hundred individual files to backup their photos. While you're at it, add the option to designate a folder to back up every new file... until you have the time to implement a full sync which would be only slightly more work. Seriously could be lot more useful with just a few simple tweaks.</review_text>

            <review_title>Fragile</review_title>
            <review_text>I've been using the app for a year or so, and it's still very temperamental. I'm always surprised when refreshes work properly, and pleasantly surprised when long lists actually load, even on the lan. It doesn't seem to use thumbnails properly, which was the whole point, to be able to browse without downloading the whole file. Camera uploads are flakey, and if your camera photos are on sdcard, it's worse. Obviously that's partially due to android's changes, but sometimes it does work.</review_text>

            <review_title>Has definitely gotten better - but major issues with photo/video sync</review_title>
            <review_text>Definitely nice that photos/videos can be sync'ed (and you can decide whether to just sync on WiFi or not); also nice that the notification for each photo/video sync'ed has been removed from the pull-down notifications bar/tray; Unfortunately - I'm having a lot of issues with sync's failing and have emailed the developer multiple times with no response. I will definitely update this with a better rating once the developer reaches out to me and the issue is fixed. Until then, it definitely works for accessing your ownCloud installation, but the photo/video sync needs some work</review_text>

            <review_title>Getting better</review_title>
            <review_text>It would be nice to be able to add additional source locations for the instant upload. This app syncs pictures and videos taken with original Android camera only. It would also be nice to have command like resync that checks any content changes from the synced folders, e.g. if you stop the sync to save battery and then start it again, this app doesn't sync any files between stop-&gt;start. One poor thing is that instant upload makes copy of all synced files to sdcard which causes that all synced files are stored twice. G+ and Dropbox sync services are better in all these ways. Although I prefer ownCloud.</review_text>

            <review_text>It does what it's supposed to do but it's very basic. I was hoping that I'd be able to do effortless syncing of all of the contents on my phone or calendar stuff with it. As it stands, there are many basic webdav clients available for free on Play which have just as much or more functionality than this app.</review_text>

            <review_title>Useless until timeout error fixed!</review_title>
            <review_text>Tried installing on a Samsung Galaxy S5, tried both rooted and non-rooted. Works fine on an old T-Mobile SpringBoard (Huawei MediaPad) with Android ICS, but under the KitKat load on the Galaxy it keeps going 'Server took too long to respond' every time I try to connect. I know this is a client issue because, as mentioned, the load on the SpringBoard works perfectly well. This also means the server side is OK with Apache as the web service end. No, I'm NOT changing my entire web structure to Nginx just to accommodate what should not have to be accommodated! This is a client-side issue and needs to be fixed at that level. Two stars only until this problem is dealt with.</review_text>

            <review_text>Good app, but it won't sync the ownCloud root folder. Have to remove the app and reinstall to sync the root folder. Sub-folders sync successfully - EDIT: This issue was resolved by updating server from v4.5.13 to v5.0.17</review_text>

            <review_text>After update can no longer log in to my ownCloud instance. I keep getting The server took too long to respond over SSL. For a paid app this is very buggy and photo upload, file refreshes are constantly failing on the rare occasions I can actually log in. Would say this is a very early alpha product which I would be ashamed of taking money for. Stay away and download another DAV client.</review_text>

            <review_title>Ok, App missing features.</review_title>
            <review_text>I would like to use this app to keep all my photo's and videos in sync/backed-up. This is possible to some extend. I only want to upload videos when i am on wifi, so by instant video upload i checked this option. I would think that when i make a video out of range of a wifi network this video would automatically upload when i connect to wifi network, unfortunately this is not the case. This would not be a total problem when you could select a folder on your phone/tablet and checked to keep this in sync on wifi/mobile. Plz add support -To automatically upload instant pictures/video when you connect to a wifi network. -Option to keep folders in sync. So that i can keep backups of other apps.</review_text>

            <review_text>This owncloud app is falling short. Only android has instant photo uploads but it logs you out periodically. This causes the uploads to break. It apparently has no resume function once this happens. Also It only backs up images from the stock camera. Photos taken inside instagram, facebook, or others are not. Camera uploads are very important to me! Please fix... Periodic log outs ( PIN does not fix this ) Resume unsynced images Add images taken outside of the default camera app.</review_text>

            <review_text>Love the DIY stuff over the limited pay services. This app connects to my server just fine and syncs as it should. So far the only major problem I have with it is whenever I restart my phone the account settings are cleared. Bit of a downside for me since I can't have this put in a production environment for some local business clients. Can't have technically challenged people re-entering account settings everytime their battery dies. Once that is resolved I will deploy this everywhere I can.</review_text>

            <review_title>so-so.</review_title>
            <review_text>Bought it because I like the idea, but I actually just need it for one very purpose (sharing one or two files directly via send to -&gt; owncloud on the device for which I haven't found a replacement yet). Using FolderSync for more complex syncing these days as the owncloud client definitely is _very_ bare-bone. At first, simply naming this owncloud is a bit misleading - it should possibly be owncloud file client as it is limited to handling WebDAV/files and ignores anything else owncloud has to offer - calendar? vcards? Plus, even in transferring files, the app leaves things to be improved: Making the storage folder configurable would be a start - I definitely would like to have this on external_SD in my device. Same, a real folder sync would help - this is basically impossible at the moment (if I manually create folders or files in the owncloud folder on the Android device, the app still doesn't see or transfer these). Maybe future versions will do better here.</review_text>

            <review_text>I really want to get away from Dropbox but I can't trust Owncloud to stay connected to my server. Every week it forgets the address and login causing it to miss syncing my photos. To make matters worse it doesn't pick up where it left off when I re-enter my information. I really, really want this to work. Unfortunately I cannot trust it.</review_text>

            <review_text>By default the option to sync files comes disabled. since the main reason anyone install this app is to sync files, I think it's a better idea that file sync comes enabled by default and let the users to disable if they want to. Would be great to have this option on the app setting and not going to Android OS account preferences to do do so.</review_text>

            <review_text>I am a 20-year career network engineer, and OwnCloud is a pain to setup even for me. I finally got the sever working, but I cannot believe they have the nerve to charge for the Android and iOS clients when they simply do not work. Support is spotty at best and you have to wade through pages and pages of forums trying dozens of supposed fixes that simply do not work. Refunded the clients and moving on to a better solution.</review_text>

            <review_title>Ok, but room for improvement</review_title>
            <review_text>Missing more synchronization options and the ability to multi select files in the upload section. The instant upload feature makes use of a separate directory on your device. Taken pictures in the DCIM directory are copied towards this separate directory and synchronized to your owncloud account. This doubles the storage usage as a taken picture is being stored within two locations on your device. Hopefully more synchronization options will correct this.</review_text>

            <review_title>hopefully the products will improve</review_title>
            <review_text>the client apps (PC &amp; Android) are a headache to setup, but that may be in part due to potentially flawed server-side installation. after chasing problems for hours and reading page after page after page of community forums to fix the issues i finally gave up. with luck they will continue to work on getting the products coded tighter, and provide some built-in troubleshooting support -- as opposed to having nothing displayed, or perhaps even usering support documentation saving users from reading so many posts desperately trying to find solutions</review_text>

            <review_text>Installed this to replace my dropbox setup. Unfortunately it's not working at all with my phone. As soon as I add my account and reboot the phone the account is forgotten. The sync options are non existant. You select the photos etc you want to upload and it will hang or give up half way. The instant upload works but I want all my camera pictures. Select folder needs to be an option. Even select folders to sync. Just getting this app to work drains the battery. Such a lot of work is needed.</review_text>

            <review_text>I installed the app and tried it a few times; it seemed to work on my server's stored files, and I successfully sync'ed a few back to the server. Unfortunately when it's installed something uses excessive battery. I notice even when nothing is being used (and owncloud does not appear at all in the battery usage indicator so I cannot be sure). I have uninstalled it. Whenever I reinstall it the phone gets hot and the battery runs down quickly.</review_text>

            <review_text>UPDATE: New build just thrashes the battery. Had to uninstall... I already sent an error log in. Missing multi select, needs to be updated to SDK 16+, UI still has portions of Froyo/GB with the download/upload intent. Sync can be slow at times. It has a ways to go, but has potential. Just use foldersync for now. Chokes on large uploads, server is configured to allow large uploads as well. Things it needs: 1. Calendar sync adapter to Android Calendar 2. Contacts sync adapter to Android Contacts 3. Multi-select to modify files: move, delete, copy (You can only delete right now, but can not multi-select) 4. Need to add an option to only allow uploading while charging as well 5. Option upload videos as well 6. Thumbnails support for videos/pictures 7. Support for ownCloud docs 8. Better tablet support These additions will get it to a 4 - 4.5, then some refinement on top of that.</review_text>

            <review_text>There is great potential for this app, but it lacks some standard features that one has come to expect from similar apps such as Dropbox. At this point I find that two missing features in particular stand out: (1) no thumbnail view of images and (2) no ability to send links to files. Other useful additions to the app would be the ability to select multiple files, an integrated way to sync contacts and calendar, and the ability to choose where the files will be stored (external SD card rather than phone memory would be nice). I consider my purchase a donation to a good cause and hope to see improvements through user support.</review_text>

            <review_title>Works but quite basic sync client</review_title>
            <review_text>Installation and connecting to my own owncloud was quick and painless. However the client is severely lacking in some basic features: 1) No way (?) to sync the entire contents of your owncloud - have to sync each file/folder individually. This may be a good thing as it allows you to only sync the items you actually want on your phone, however it would be equally good to be able to say sync all and then unselect certain items. 2) No way to specify the location on your phone. This is a BIG problem for people whose main memory is more or less full but have an SD card available. 3) No way to specify the auto-upload location of photos. 4) No way to share files/folders with other users While owncloud itself is great I struggle to be able to recommend this client in its current state as a paid-for app. Once fully-featured, I'd be more than happy to recommend it.</review_text>

            <review_text>there is no preview or small icon for picture. you need to open 1 by 1 to search your photo. each photo you open to see will downloaded to your phone and this will eat all your phone space especially for low end and mid mobile phone~</review_text>

            <review_text>This will get you going, syncing and sharing, and creating directories. But it needs media and app integration. Where's the calender, the music player, photo viewer? And in the long run, the messaging and all the other available apps. Needs work.</review_text>

            <review_title>Lacking in features</review_title>
            <review_text>While it looks great and the basic functionality is there, it's lacking in a lot of features I would have liked to see. You can't change the storage location, you can't download a whole folder at once, you can't share files etc. It's a pretty new app so hopefully these will be added soon.</review_text>

            <review_title>Just what I've been looking for ... almost</review_title>
            <review_text>The app works great except for the fact that it syncs all data on the root directory (/) of the phone (device). It would be fantastic if the sync directory was on the sd card (ExtSdCard) instead. This way it wouldn't take up all the space available and slow the phone (device) down. I would say many users would prefer this. Also, please know that I looked into moving the app to the sd card but this phone (device; that being a Samsung Note 2 / Sprint / CDMA) has specific hardware constraints that will not allow this. So please consider adjusting the app to include the ability to do the above. Thank you for all your hard work and have a fantastic day!</review_text>

            <review_text>Overall the all is pretty good and very fast, but I think one of the major things missing is the ability to create and send share links. This is one of the reasons I built a personal server, and one of the reasons I picked owncloud is the ability to easily create and share the share links. I think this is a pretty major functionality that I'd really like to see in the next version of this app, however it's pretty decent as is.</review_text>

            <review_text>The PIN code input still is really slow. Most often I first type the code too fast to register and have to retype it. This feels like a security flaw as it makes the code easier to overlook. Other than that it does what it does well. Features lacking are of course calendar, task and contact sync, but there are other apps for that.</review_text>

            <review_title>Needs work</review_title>
            <review_text>They need to integrate the JB workaround into the app, and add some common features found in other cloud apps - I notice picture are constantly rotated incorrectly after upload, forcing you to fix the from a PC. Also, a reinstall of the app can re-upload pics into your instant upload folder. Its a good start, but needs polishing.</review_text>

            <review_text>This isn't a sync client. It's little better than what the mobile Web site should be. It listens to the NEW_PICTURE event to instantly upload new pictures you take, but it doesn't let you choose where they go, nor does it do anything like a 2-way sync. This app needs to do a lot more before I'd recommend it.</review_text>

It's a shame that it seems this app doesn't allow you to update you account password once set. You have to delete the account and re-enter everything. If I'm wrong it would be nice if anyone can inform me of how to change it on the fly.... Also after easy update you have to specify all your connections again... Really annoying</review_text>

            <review_text>Unfortunately it is not usable, it event can not display content of folder other than the main folder. I am not trying other features like upload or download. Idea is good and I hope issue will be fixed soon. Update : tried to upload an 11mb file and it said upload failed after %4. I have a fast Internet connection and other cloud applications has no problem. Do not buy until it is usable.</review_text>

            <review_title>only 3 stars for now</review_title>
            <review_text>I am only giving it three stars because I am happy that someone has made a personal web cloud server available. I just installed it on my home server. Its working. But the Android app has a very short timeout setting. Being a residential home, my ISP slows down my upload speeds, and I need more time for my server to respond. So until I can allow my tablets and phones to access the owncloud server, only 3 stars, for the fact that it is actually working, and running.</review_text>

            <review_text>One of the main reasons I have this is for the photo backup, and that is spotty. It will attempt to upload the files, but sometimes they fail. and the app will notify of the failures, but it will not retry. It would be nice if it built of queue of files to retry with the next upload. Additionally, I would like the option to have it monitor a specific folder/set of folders to keep synced. This is cool, but it feels like a very stripped down dropbox.</review_text>

            <review_title>Doesn't work with too many files</review_title>
            <review_text>It doesn't work for me, because you are trying to store the whole file structure locally, unlike Dropbox where they just load files and folders of the currently opened folder. this results for me (~0.5 Mio Files) to an all night long updating/refreshing, after which I can see ~1/10 of the files on my app, and no way to access the others. My server was running the whole night and has 100MBit internet access (16GB RAM, Core i5 CPU), and my internet connection is ~20MBit up and ~50MBit down. And the server doesn't do anything so far except serving owncloud. Please fix that, or don't ask any money for it. I'm using Samsung Galaxy S2 - if anybody has that amount of files and it works for him with a different phone, please tell me - thx</review_text>

            <review_title>This app is very poor</review_title>
            <review_text>Needs simple things like the option to manually refresh a folder. I use samba shares on my server and the app never works with them. For a paid app this is really poor form. While I appreciate that owncloud is free which is awesome, you could put a bit more time in to the bits people pay for. I know its only a dollar but as a consumer I expect more out of the things I pay for.</review_text>

            <review_text>Apps OK for accessing files on the cloud but the upload of photos is faulty and can't be relied upon as it fails most of the time and doesn't retry. It also doesn't scan for photos that exist before turning the feature on so doesn't automatically back then up.</review_text>

            <review_text>I support this effort because we have to get off commercial data repositories. Corparations get rights to your family photos and writings when you put them on things like dropbox. But the syncing all broken constantly. On this app and the server you run at your house. Owncloud will be better in a year but is unrelyable as is. But they are moving fast and towards something truely great so kudos. If this was a paid company though it would surely be a zero.</review_text>

            <review_text>I had an update or two now and I have had to reinstall the app to get everything up and running again. I am not sure if this is an issue with the owncloud android app or the fact that I have enabled the experimental encryption on owncloud. in anycase this app has not let me down on my lg motion 4g for metropcs and I would give it five stars if I could set password or combination rather than a 4 number pin. regardless I love this app, it has given me control over my files and how I can sync them on all my devices.</review_text>

            <review_text>App used to work great until today's release. Now I can connect to my owncloud (self hosted) but cannot access it nor upload files. Any clue? EDIT: it almost worked with uninstalling/reinstalling JB Workaround. I can now access account, but it seems that every upload/download is failing. EDIT2: after removing app (and wiping data with Titanium) and reinstalling/updating everything seems to be working fine. Cheers to Christopher!</review_text>

            <review_text>I've been using this app for a while and for the most basic operations (reading a file that is sorted in my ownCloud server) it works well. What I am really missing (and what has caused me to look elsewhere) is the ability to automatically sync an entire directory and to automatically upload new files I created in the owncloud directory on my mobile device. I can share a single file from an app, but this is too cumbersome for my needs.</review_text>

            <review_text>The developers are very responsive and courteous. The feature I requested was responded and added within a week. This app has great potential, however it seems serverside and/or desktop client are not so great. Server and desktop programs were so buggy(such as infamous infinitely bloating conflict file) I had to abandon the whole installation on my private server. Anyhow, if you are already utilizing ownCloud on your server, this app is a solid (if not the only) choice.</review_text>

            <review_text>Refreshes have to be done MANUALLY. Files have to be downloaded before viewing. Image support is junk. OwnCloud is a good service though.

            <review_text>love that it can upload pictures taken but it has one major drawback.. if the upload fails you have to manually upload it. It does not retry to upload the failed pictures. In my case happens a lot because of limited data connection and spotty wifi areas. As long as i am at home and have wifi it uploads fine.. If they could fix this it would make it worth the $1.</review_text>

            <review_text>The main thing I needed this for was the photo upload, which works but requires manual intervention (folder creation) due to a known bug. For the rest, file sync doesn't seem to work and uses massive amounts of power while doing so. The UI is crude, but good enough. I haven't tried any other features.</review_text>

            <review_text>I already sync all of my home and work PC's via ownCloud, and love it. Having access on the go is a great add on. The app works well for the most part but the instant upload feature appears to be broken, at least on CM10.1 (Android 4.2.2). After taking a picture there is a toast popup that complains about not being online the first time instant upload is running, even though I have full 4G service and the wifi only option is disabled in the app. Tried it w/ wifi on and it still failed. Update: Manually creating a folder named InstantUpload got rid of the warnings and the feature started working. Looks like there is a bug in the code that creates the folder if it doesn't exist.</review_text>

            <review_text>This app is not of much use for me. Sync doesnt work properly, refreshing the remote content list takes ages. At least a picture slideshow would be very nice. So long, i prefer foldersync to keep everything up to date and use any webdav browser to access the owncloud server. Anyway, nice idea. Hopefully this app will improve soon...</review_text>

            <review_title>It's a beginning...</review_title>
            <review_text>It's great to have the ability to access your owncloud files from tablet or phone, but in real life it's still way too alpha for everyday use. I have a big tree of directories and files (for example, copied my complete dropbox in it), and even if I'm using a decent wifi connection, some files are synced, the others are not. There are folders (of which Work seems to be the most important one) which simply don't synchronize. I guess it is because the syncing process halts at some moment, but if you compare the speed with which Dropbox shows folder content and with which Owncloud shows folder content --&gt; that's a huuuuuge difference. In short, I think it's going well, but more frequent updates would definitely be nice as would a more complete GUI and smarter syncing be (give priority to a directory I'm viewing instead of syncing some other one I probably don't need for another week).</review_text>

            <review_text>I bought this app a few months ago to support the owncloud project. It didn't work with my ownCloud server running on nginx. I think this was the apps fault as there were alot of bad reviews. Tested it today and it works wonderfully. Instant picture upload worked and the app is snappy and does as it's told. This is now my way of saving + sharing photos from my phone, and will replace evernote once we can get autosync. Thanks ownCloud team! I knew this app would come together!</review_text>

            <review_title>Inconsistent.</review_title>
            <review_text>(0) The pictures that are newly uploaded are corrupted? My computer is not able to read the recently uploaded. (1) Fails very frequently to upload pictures. No chance to retry? How do I see the list of failed upload other than the notification bar? Clicking on fail notification should lead to the file that failed to give a chance to retry, and to know the reason. How about a red X on the files that failed when browsing? (2) Nice additions: select all, video/picture thumbnail view, todo list sync. (3) For the OwnCloud server, Google Calendar/Contact sync, not just mounting GDrive.</review_text>

            <review_text>Works good but would be nice to be able to select multiple files and directories for syncing. Tried to upload several directorys w/ pix inside; After the upload, all directorys were stripped off and all the pix ended up in one directory on the server. Aside from that, its works pretty good from what I can see. Have just had it installed for two days now.</review_text>

            <review_text>I always tried to use the free app in the past but that one didn't work at all. So I was really excited and finally bought the commercial version.

            <review_text>I'm really a fan of OwnCloud. I installed an instance on my linux server at home an sync several windows PCs. But without an automatic synchronization of files modified on my android device, this app is absolutely useless for me. I hope you guys will implement this feature ASAP. I will check GitHub. Perhaps I can do it on my own.</review_text>

            <review_text>I agree with earlier posts, it should not be out of alpha release: why should I pay for this? Downloading multiple files crashes app/phone, keeping files up-to-date crashes app/phone. You can download single files and upload single files. This app has less functionality than the web GUI. Quit charging people for your broken trash.</review_text>

            <review_text>Can't believe I paid money for this. Biggest bug bear is that it loses account credentials on reboot, and I do that a lot considering I'm using cm10 roms.

            <review_text>EDIT: The latest version seems to fix battery drain issues. I won't knock this app too much since this is the very first release, but it goes without saying that there are a lot of changes that need to be made. Why am I unable to select multiple items? Why can't I download a folder? Why am I unable to press a button to get a share link in the file context menu? I could do that on the Tonido app, and I really miss it. On the plus side, instant upload seems really nifty.</review_text>

                <sentence_text>     Unfortunately it could use a little work: the app should just upload the files i choose instead of copying the files to a different folder, and then uploading, thus using up unnecessary space; the pin security option lags and I have to enter it slowly, making it susceptible to shoulder surfing; whenever I upload something and lose network connectivity, it just gives an error instead of pausing the upload and continuing at a later time</sentence_text>
