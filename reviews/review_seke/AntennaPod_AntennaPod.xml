      <review_text>Fine. Sometimes doesn't restar_ratingt after an interruption. It would be nice to be able to play back in date order regardless of download order. If you're catching up on many episodes of some podcast, it would be nice to break away from this podcast when other podcasts have new episodes available.</review_text>

      <review_title/>
      <review_text>Surprised to find that this is one of the only apps in the Play Store that supports premium subscription podcasts. That being said, I can't get the auto download feature to work and there seems to be no default sort option, requiring daily manual intervention to get podcasts downloaded and organized. Submitted a help request on these items but got no response. Would quickly run to something else.</review_text>

      <review_text>This app is simple to use and very convenient. I really like the ability to play back podcasts at a higher speed. Only frustration is when I want to find a specific podcast in the 'browse gpodder' section - I end up having to Google the podcast's feed url and paste it in. Other than that great app!</review_text>

      <review_title>Best Podcaster I have found for Android</review_title>
      <review_text>This is the most controllable and easiest to set up podcaster I have found outside of an Apple device! This easily lets me set up how I wish to download podcast, including allowing me to add RSS feeds, and I can have them set to Auto delete from the phone once I have listened. Very impressed.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great Podcast App!</review_title>
      <review_text>The only podcasts I haven't been able to find are rather small and unknown, so great selection of podcasts! Has a good amount of features as well; I always use the sleep timer. I have no intention of switching apps any time soon, and I plan to continue listening to podcasts so AntennaPod has my vote!</review_text>

      <review_text>AntennaPod is at least as good as any of the proprietary podcast clients out there, but it's open source. No adds, no begging you to upgrade to pro. It does what it says on the tin and does it well. Can't ask for more.</review_text>

      <review_title>Excellent, but could be perfect!</review_title>
      <review_text>Almost exactly what I was looking for, but I wish it would consistently play in the background with other apps (it does sometimes but not with others). Also wish it had a 'keep last [#] of episodes' feature. Lastly it would be nice if you kept drivers in mind. I'm always looking for something I can poke at quickly without becoming distracted while driving - so big fonts, big buttons, simple interface.</review_text>

      <review_text>UPDATE: Dec 27 - The problem I had was that new episodes weren't being DL because the old ones weren't actually being deleted from my phone. Even tho I set it to delete played episodes and they were still on my phone but not available through this app unless i re-DL the file. Need to manually delete the files using a file manager. *****DEC 26 2016. It's not downloading new episodes suddenly. I thought I should update it but that didn't help.</review_text>

      <review_title>Works great!</review_title>
      <review_text>Simple, straight forward app, requires less intrusive access than many others like it (why would a podcast app need my camera!?)</review_text>

      <review_title>Was decent... but now dead.</review_title>
      <review_text>This app has been maybe slightly less frustrating than most podcast apps I've tried. Sounds funny, but there are too many options (for me). I want simplicity and a clean UI without too much hassle or tweaking. **As of 12/24/16 it no longer works. At. All.** I tap to open... it closes immediately. Reported issue. Everything it states last update fixed is actually what's happening NOW. (Wasnt before.) Will try another app for now &amp; try again later.</review_text>

      <review_text>Shake to restar_ratingt sleep timer never works, and delay is so short you can't grab the phone, unlock it and reset sleep timer before it pauses. Sometimes unresponsive black screen. Playback controls too small, easy to hit wrong one.</review_text>

      <review_text>Clean, accessible interface, precise scrubbing controls for finding a place in a podcast. It does crash at times while navigating the app, but if you hit play and just run the app in the background it will run reliably and indefinitely. It's free, has no ads, and it works, can't ask for more.</review_text>

      <review_title>Podcasts won't star_ratingt - Update: Podcasts Vaporized</review_title>
      <review_text>UPDATE: podcasts star_ratingted playing and things were good and then poof, all podcasts and subscriptions disappeared with no recovery options. Emailed support two weeks ago and got no response... Lame. /update No podcast would star_ratingt playing whether I tried streaming or downloading. I could tap play and pause and scroll the timeline, but the podcasts would not play. Also podcast thumbnails didn't load. Pretty frustrating.</review_text>

      <review_title>Good, but has a few flaws</review_title>
      <review_text>Antenna Pod meets most of what I'm looking for in a podcast app. It's had a few glitches along the way, but overall it's been good. Lately it's star_ratingted to not want to turn on my home screen while playing a podcast, requiring me to press the home button multiple times before it will turn on the screen and let me unlock it. Mostly just annoying, but still. Again, overall quite good, though!</review_text>

      <review_text>Was great. Now, with the latest update, the app freezes on completion of a podcast episode and I have to reboot my device. The list of what was fixed for the Dec 6. update shows exactly all of the ways the app crashes NOW. Instead of fixing the, they were introduced. The opposite of usable.</review_text>

      <review_text>Things make this the stand out podcast app for me. 1. The ability to mono the audio. 2. The ability to use Chromecast. 3. Complete control over playlist behaviour. All this quite apart from being excellent at managing my podcast habit. ..... if only this app was available on iOS as well.</review_text>

      <review_title>Finally a podcast app that's easy</review_title>
      <review_text>I have been trying out and installing numerous podcast apps that all seemed to refer to some old skool way of doing things. This app I just got from the get-go. It works intuitively and most used functions are just there for you, instead of tucked away in the menus. I can finally follow podcasts.</review_text>

      <review_title>Good, but one major problem</review_title>
      <review_text>The widget part of the app barely works. Usually the podcast I was listening to doesn't show up, so I have to just click on it to access the podcast from within the main app. Or it shows the podcast I was listening to, but when I click the play button nothing happens. Otherwise a wonderful app.</review_text>

      <review_text>Well organized. Have to download programs to guarantee reliable playback as streaming often results in backward jumps by a few seconds or ending a program prematurely, but that may be a weakness of any podcast app which interprets a hesitation in internet connection (?). I don't know. Never have that problem with videos, but frequently with podcast players.</review_text>

      <review_text>Great program - free, open source, uncluttered and does the job. One small feature request that, of course doesn't diminish the above, but would be highly sensible and, judging from discussions online, there seems to be philosophical resistance to considering unfortunately- in particular. some podcast subscriptions, such as planet money, sometimes require manual download of a podcast; would be very helpful if these could be organized in and played and kept track of from the program as well.</review_text>

I will click on the actual episode and hit the bigger play button and it still won't work. After maybe 10 tries it might work. Fixing this would be appreciated!</review_text>

      <review_text>Had a competitor podcast app until their free trial ran out, and was shocked they would charge 拢7 for automatic downloads. Found this app, and it gives tonnes of options to tweak, auto download, auto delete, frequent updates by an active developer all for free</review_text>

      <review_title>Great podcast manager</review_title>
      <review_text>I use this application on a every day! It has a clear and simple UI with some advanced option such as the automatic download of new podcasts and automatically erasing old or played podcasts. I suggest two improvements: the podcast search only shows the top US podcasts. enhancing the podcast search, improving the suggestions, filtering by language or display related podcasts would be a great plus. The second point is the sync possibilities. So far, you can only sync through gpodder that times out a lo</review_text>

      <review_text>Sick and tired of having to create yet another account just so you can use a podcast application?

      <review_title>Pretty good.</review_title>
      <review_text>Works pretty well, except for a couple issues. 1) Despite the option being selected in Settings, the play/pause controls do not persist when playback is paused for other audio. I also wish the controls persisted after playback is ended, so it is quicker to jump back into the app to select a new podcast. 2) sometimes the app glitches out, and plays the audio in the background, with no way to stop it. Press play/pause will result in two instenses of playback. I can't reproduce the issue, but it has occured.</review_text>

      <review_text>I have always been hardcore Android, but used to carry an iPhone with me too for my music and podcasts.

      <review_text>This is freaking great. I'd been using Google's Play Music app for podcasts which works pretty well but had a few issues. I star_ratingted looking for a new app when a podcast I wanted want available on Play. I've used Stitcher before and find it annoying, but then I found this and I'm very impressed. The ability to search iTunes, Google pods, or directly from a URL is amazing. There's also no delay in new episodes showing up which is another issue I had with the default Google app. Plenty of settings to tweak!</review_text>

      <review_text>On Samsung Note 3, Android ver 5.0: The other reviewers have hit the qualities: Very easy to use, fast behavior, refreshingly uncluttered interface. One minor gripe I have is that there is apparently no way to cancel a download all episodes request once it's accidentally star_ratingted. Nonetheless, it's so good I would pay for this if it weren't free. Five star_ratings well deserved.</review_text>

      <review_text>Seems to work well overall. Auto download fails occasionally for whatever reason with a sort of useless page telling you. Would be nice if it was easier to update manually.</review_text>

      <review_text>This podcast catcher does it all, even video. Best of all, it's free and open source, so there are no ads. Try this first, you can always export OPML to load your feeds into others. Even better now that it supports playback speeds.</review_text>

      <review_title>Can't Disable Lock-Screen Skip Button</review_title>
      <review_text>Overall, it's kind of a cumbersome app, but does well enough. A huge problem for me the inability, despite changing the settings, to disable the 'skip' button. I've lost my place in countless podcasts when my phone gets triggered in my pocket and the button--that I CANNOT remove--gets bumped.</review_text>

      <review_text>Love the app. Thanks for taking the time to make it and free... Very nice. Clean simple interface, light, loads fast. One request, can you add options for the amount of time you can skip forward and backward during playback? Maybe like 10, 30, 60 seconds, selectable in settings?</review_text>

      <review_text>I may look further but I am very happy with Antenna Pod. All the features I think I need, except a time adjust feature that would allow me enough time to listen to everything I want 馃榾 Long time audio book listener, just like them, choose what you like. I've subscribed &amp; unsubscribed to dozens of podcasts. Strongly recommend TWIT, Radiolab &amp; A Way with Words</review_text>

      <review_text>Some interface flaws like the back button exiting instead of moving back, download over wireless setting buried and not available from prompt. But, it's still better than the others I've tried.</review_text>

      <review_text>Been using Pocket Casts for a long time (big fan), but I had to give this a try, since open-source software is very important to me. This has a very familiar interface, lacks nothing I need, and it's worked as expected for me. A real pleasure to use. I've switched to this app, wholesale. Fantastic job!</review_text>

      <review_title>Great podcatcher... 5 star_ratings if...</review_title>
      <review_text>...the play button on the widget was able to unpause. Workaround is to simply to pull up the full app and press play from there. Pause on the widget works but not play. Also, sometimes while listening to a podcast as app runs in background, the show will pause when I engage my browser app. Using Opera for Android on LG G pad f 8.0 on android 6.0</review_text>

      <review_text>I came from an alternative product that had bloated into something unusable. Antenna pod has worked fine, not been a bandwidth hog but with all the normal feature needed for podcasts. My only gripe is the podcasts could do with a little more details on the selection page without going into the podcast to see the description.</review_text>

      <review_title>Was perfect but now it's randomly rewinding 15-20 seconds - really annoying</review_title>
      <review_text>This was a fantastic app for podcasts but recently it will skip back and replay the same content. The app will be running on screen (it doesn't matter if the phone is locked or if it is open and active), with or without earphones (no other gadget attached) and it will randomly replay the previous 15-30 seconds. This is during play with no interruptions on my behalf. Hope my updates can help find a solution, but I'm unsure if you will be alerted to the edits I've made to this..</review_text>

      <review_text>I've been podcast player shopping for a while - disappointed by SOMEthing at every turn. But finally this podcast functions well, let's me easily add to my que, speeds up and slows down, download or stream (streaming always has bumps and skips, in every player) . I love it. Because I've used so many others there are a few things that are harder to find (add all unheard episodes to que, stream =play) but the more I use it, the more i like it.</review_text>

      <review_title>Does everything it should do</review_title>
      <review_text>...and nothing it shouldn't. I had tried many apps to follow podcasts in the past, including ones from the sites themselves (podbean, SoundCloud) but this app just does it better. Just put in an RSS feed, and boom, hassle free organizing and download of all your podcasts. Props to the devs, I wish all apps worked this well.</review_text>

      <review_title>Works but..</review_title>
      <review_text>I have never been able to get the automatic downloads to work. And after the last update all my podcasts play too fast. Not extremely fast, but just enough to be annoying. I have disabled sonic player and it makes no difference. What is really weird, is the podcasts star_ratingt out really fast, but after 10 or 15 seconds they slow to almost normal, but not quite.</review_text>

      <review_title>Clean Logical Interface with No Ads!</review_title>
      <review_text>I have previously been a BeyondPod and Podcast Addict User and while they're both good, they can also both be heavy &amp; clunky to navigate. This app is much cleaner in layout, everything is in a logical place. There is also plenty of room for customisation like filtering your auto downloads in a feed by keyword, and automatically adding downloaded episodes to your queue. This is an excellent app. 5 star_ratings.</review_text>

      <review_text>I tried several podcast apps before Antenna Pod. There were pros and cons for each, some had a good selection of podcasts, but lousy design. Others had better design but I couldn't get all my favorite podcasts. Antenna pod has a pretty good layout and finds all podcasts by searching iTunes. Pretty good idea. I recommend it!</review_text>

      <review_title>By far the best I've used</review_title>
      <review_text>I tried half a dozen different podcast apps before finding one that was actually intuitive to navigate. The only quibble I have is that I had to plug in feed addresses for a couple of my more obscure casts that some others found, but that's a small price to pay for a decent interface!</review_text>

      <review_text>I love the search function that helps you find new podcasts. My old player didn't have that function. Very easy to add new podcasts, download episodes, and play. It would be nice to be able to change the que easier, but that's a fairly minor problem. Overall, i love it and will be sticking with it!</review_text>

      <review_text>It works right. If you want to listen to streams or read news from RSS, this is the app you should use. The only thing I would change is to add a more useful and obvious home screen for an overview of subscriptions and what's playing, so I don't back button all the way out of the app so frequently.</review_text>

      <review_text>I was used to beyond podcast and I still think that antenna pod could simplify and tidy up the sections. ..why are there so many? !

      <review_title>Good but has streaming issues</review_title>
      <review_text>The interface is nice and simple and adding podcasts could not be easier. Playing from a stream has been uneven at best. Stream will drop and will not come back without phone reboot and even then sometimes it won't play. Of course, I could download but that's not the point. Other than the streaming issue antenna has been great.</review_text>

      <review_text>Went from iOS to Android, this is the best equivalent I could find to listen to my podcasts. Everything seems to work perfectly, I particularly enjoy the batch processing features.

      <review_text>Since moving to android from iOS I've been looking for a decent podcast app. After searching the play store, online reviews and top 10's then trying them all out I was still disappointed. Ads, cluttered layouts, and complex apps were all I found. However in a review_texts section I saw this app recommended, and I must say its great. Not just because I couldn't get on with the others but this app is easy to use and manage your subscriptions and episodes, has a good layout that's both aesthetic and user friendly.</review_text>

      <review_text>Bottom Line: It does everything I want, ad free. Every time I thought it was lacking a feature, I eventually found how to do it in the Settings because there are A LOT of options in the Settings. Small Complaint: After I selected my podcasts, I wanted to use it on my PC, but it's Android only. Also, I had to wipe my Android phone, but couldn't figure out how to save my podcast list, and had to reselect them all after phone was reset. But it's a great App.</review_text>

      <review_text>Without an option to download oldest first this app is useless for listening to story podcast which is a real shame because it is awesome in all other respects.</review_text>

      <review_title>Yay, AntennaPod!</review_title>
      <review_text>AntennaPod is pretty and it consistently loads podcasts' artwork. It also has useful sharing features and I like the way that it organizes episodes. My only complaint is that it exhibits odd back-button behavior, often bringing me back to Android home instead of the previous page in the app. Also, playback occasionally stops when running Waze. This behavior is rare enough that I haven't bothered to investigate.</review_text>

      <review_title>Very smooth and smart UI</review_title>
      <review_text>Simply the best of the free podcasts players out there. It doesn't have a splashy UI or fancy extra features -- just the podcasts you want. Easy to stream or download. Unlike some plays who use their own databases or RSS feeds, this one pulls straight from Apple podcasts! No more will your favorite podcast be unavailable to you, if they upload to iTunes (almost everyone does), you'll have perfect updated access to it. I recommend this player to anyone new or old to podcasts.</review_text>

      <review_text>Definitely my favorite podcast app yet. It has a few features in grateful for, that I didn't think I'd use since other apps didn't have them. The little storage and queue tweaks are very welcome. It could use an increase in cache size and the ability to limit a number of episodes instead of cache, but that's it.</review_text>

      <review_text>I've been using AntennaPod for about 6 months and I have found that it well suited to collecting and listening to podcasts. I try to use open source whenever I can but sometimes find the applications to be very rough and difficult to navigate. This is not the case with antennapod so I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a straightforward and dependable podcast manager.</review_text>

      <review_text>Would you believe how many podcasting apps there are? And how difficult it was too find a good one. Well after trying many over the last few years, this one finally fits the bill: it has clean, clear and simple interface, yet is flexible enough to do everything I want - search podcasts, simply skip forward and back, automatically delete after listening, change playback speed. My only wish is that it would remember the speed and volume setting for each subscription.</review_text>

      <review_text>You should use this app. I've been using Antenna for a few years now and continue to grow my appreciation for it every update -- heck every *day*. I paid for a few podcast apps before getting turned onto Antenna so I feel especially qualified to proclaim that this is the best podcasting app that bandwidth can get. It's free, updated surprisingly often, and feature robust. It works excellently and has continued to improve since I began using it.</review_text>

      <review_text>Does everything I expected. Specifically: allows you to listen to podcasts in chronological order. Go to your queue and tell it to sort by date released. Several of the other podcast apps don't allow that to happen. They responded and I was mistaken. There is an option to download all episodes. Perfect app</review_text>

      <review_title>Perfect App</review_title>
      <review_text>Full disclosure....I am not associated with the user(s) of this app and I feel no need to give gushing reviews. That said, this is the perfect app for anybody who wants to download, manage, and mow through podcasts. I have tried at least 20 other apps and only found 1-2 others that allow me to access and listen to podcasts like this one does.</review_text>

      <review_title>Don't carry an iPhone</review_title>
      <review_text>Just switched back to Android. I was going to keep the iPhone for podcast listening because podcast apps aren't really that great in Android. However, Antennapod has all the features I need to leave my iPhone behind. I use a Google Nexus 5x with Marshmallow.</review_text>

      <review_text>I've been addicted to podcasts for my college commute for nearly a year now, and I've tried so many different apps. This one is the best refined, gives the best experience, and allows great control and suitability to your needs. It also looks fantastic, very sleek and elegant minimal design, love it</review_text>

      <review_title>Finally - no hassle podcasts!</review_title>
      <review_text>This app works very well, and makes it easy for me to find and try new podcasts, listen to a rotation of different podcasts, optionally download episodes over wifi to avoid high data use, and track which episodes I've listened to. Doesn't lose track of what you're listening to regardless of phone calls, reboots, or long-term pauses.</review_text>

      <review_text>I haven't tried many more, but that's because once I found this one, I stopped looking.

      <review_text>With the latest update this player leaves all the others in the dust. Paid and unpaid. No esoteric resource hungry featured. Incredibly stable. Good looking working perfectly for a podcast addict like me. This is my most used app. It's playing 6-12 hours a day! It never ever fails and with the Sonic player built in it sounds great even through my high end ear buds. I really want to pay for this app! For me it's worth double digit dollars Try it. Love it and move on. This is THE player right now!</review_text>

      <review_text>Fantastic and simple, would like the ability to limit downloads per feed for example Blomberg has many episodes. But I love this podcast client and the speed playback</review_text>

      <review_title>Best Podcast App for Android</review_title>
      <review_text>Just recently switched from an iPhone and was looking for a good podcast app. I've tried all the top ones and this is by far the best one. It's easy to use, great search function, no ads, and a clean user interface...</review_text>

      <review_title>Excellent podcast app</review_title>
      <review_text>I'm very pleased with AntennaPod. It does exactly what it says on the label and it does it very well. It allows you to subscribe, download and organize your podcasts in a very intuitive way without any extraneous bells and whistles, and it just works. As other reviewers have said, it's a far better, more user-friendly app than many commercial podcatchers I've tried, so kudos to the AntennaPod team for keeping it free and open source!</review_text>

      <review_text>Like many other reviewers here, I've installed and rejected countless pod apps during my 7 years with Android phones. Antennapod is, by a considerable margin, the best I've used. Without fuss, it seems to have all the features I want, and none of the bloat I don't need. I'd happily pay for it if it didn't happen to be free...</review_text>

      <review_text>This is the best Podcast app I've found. I tried 3 other podcast apps and they don't come close to AntennaPod. I love the speed up feature. A Lot of podcasts don't have commercials and if you don;t like a topic then just fast forward to the next. Who knew an one hour show on the radio is really only 34 min or less on a podcast.</review_text>

      <review_title>My favourite podcast app, and I have tried many!</review_title>
      <review_text>I tried a lot of others since Google abandoned thier Listen app and this is the best replacement in my opinion. Nice looking, functional interface. All the queueing, playback, and download options I need. You can automate downloads for each subscription. Queue playback settings help avoid accidental deletion or skipping. Very granular settings, which I like. But easy enough to operate while driving or walking. Playback speed is still in beta as of this review but has been working fine for me.</review_text>

      <review_text>I really really like this podcast app. Being new to podcasts in general I was put off by all the podcast apps that had to be bought. I can understand why you would buy one. But how would I know I would keep listening to podcasts enough to justify me buying anything. I looked for several free options until I stumbled into antennapod. So far i love it, and really appreciate that it is open source. You guys have really done the world a service with your app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Works great so far, better than others</review_title>
      <review_text>This is my second full use podcast app, I used another one for many months that star_ratingted to crash my phone, using its free version, so I was not about to pay for it when free was messing with Android. With AP, everything runs smoothly, getting new episodes is easier and sound is always consistent. I will update if any issues or other great things arise! So far so great.</review_text>

      <review_text>This does everything I ask it to do with very little errors and it's actually free (I'm talking to you Doggcatcher). It doesn't auto-update, but that's okay. I've yet to lock it up. Another plus, it can search ITunes for podcasts.</review_text>

      <review_text>Simple, handy player and downloader. Like the speed controls and jump forward and back buttons. Would be useful to have up / down speed buttons instead of a one-way scroll. Embedded player is accessible from file list that includes files not d/led with the app, though in this use it doesn't remember the position of paused files.</review_text>

      <review_text>A lil refinement needed, I looked far and wide for an ad free podcast app, and this meets that requirement and so many more! You can search and add podcasts from iTunes directly. Only thing I wish was different is to be able to delete downloaded podcasts directly from the episode interfaces</review_text>

      <review_text>This is the best app hands down. I use it almost every day on a MXPE running marshmallow. Sometimes it will have a hiccup playing back but that's usually solved by either restar_ratingting the app or just switching back to the queue and re-selecting the podcast.</review_text>

      <review_text>I've tried a lot of podcatchers, but keep coming back to this. It's simple, but it just works, except for the occasional crash, or download error. Which happens often enough that I have looked for other options. But despite those issues, I'm still a big fan of this app. Thanks for making it, folks</review_text>

      <review_text>This is a great podcast player with what seems like a reasonable amount of permissions... For free. It has all the bells and whistles I could want save for a tweak here and there (e.g.: perhaps a better way to distinguish which podcasts you've already heard... The grey text is quite close to plain black). All in all, a great app. Highly recommended!</review_text>

      <review_text>Great but some problems just arose. 1. I can't scroll through an episode. The 30 second forward/back button doesn't work. 2. Jumping to the middle with the scroll bar will work once but it just jumps to a random place that doesn't match the scroll position. It won't respond to any other junior after that. 3. The episode won't stop playing. The pause button won't work. Closing the app won't work. I have to force stop through settings.</review_text>

      <review_title>Skips and stalls</review_title>
      <review_text>After a recent update I have found a few problems when one episode has finished and moving on to the next. The playback stalls and freezes and plays intermittently, and won't allow me to 'come out' of the episode. The only way to do this is to close the app itself and open it again. Having said that, I have tried a few podcast apps on my android phone and this has suited me better than those up until the recent issues, so I will probably continue to use it and hope that updates resolve the problem</review_text>

      <review_text>This is the only podcast app I've used and I like it. It does the job and is really straightforward.

      <review_text>I really like the queue feature. I've used other apps before and they never let me set up a queue so I don't have to select a new podcast every hour. Great jearb!</review_text>

      <review_title>Open source forgives issues</review_title>
      <review_text>I'll star_ratingt here, if you don't care about Foss or privacy or the like, this isn't your app. Compared to say podcatcher it's missing three features, the ability to use video podcast, the ability to skip silence, and the ability to subscribe to YouTube channels (probably not as important to you as me) but it's free (as in speech) and it does what it says on the tin so five star_ratings irregardless.</review_text>

      <review_text>Works well, haven't had any major problems or issues. Pause button went unresponsive once or twice but I think that may have been an issue with my phone since it was an isolated incident and I've been using the app for a few months. Would recommend this app, it does what it's supposed to well and over all I'm pretty happy with it</review_text>

      <review_title>Simple yet effective</review_title>
      <review_text>This app does what it is supposed to with a clean interface and easy access to new podcasts. I tried several other Android podcast apps with unnecessary features and terrible UIs and could not comprehend why there were no simple apps that worked without crashing or stalling to load ads. This is everything I need in a podcast app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Audio control issues</review_title>
      <review_text>I love this app but the latest update is acting weird on my nexus 5x. Whenever I try to use the audio controls to pause or play, the entire app stops responding. It does not crash however. When I close the app from the app list , it still continues to play in the background and I have no way of stopping the audio unless I force quit the app. Very annoying, I can't use any of the audio controls without this happening.</review_text>

      <review_text>Dear Developer, this app is beautiful and I just love it. Yet, there's just one bug which bugs me night and day: there being no code to manually and automatically pause downloading, half the time the downloads result in errors, on our slow connection speeds of 512 kbps. I'd request you to kindly implement this in an update so that we no longer face this problem that makes one's head boil with anger. Thank You.</review_text>

      <review_text>Really useful app. The only thing - I don't know - why application may be closed by OS or unloaded from RAM while I'm listening it. UPD: it looks like app process has less priorities than other ones. Or Android just kills background audio service. Steps to reproduce: just continue using your phone, running new apps and at the end application will close.</review_text>

      <review_text>Update: problem no longer occurring, and some nice improvements to the interface on newer versions. Now Five star_ratings. Not giving 5 stats because the latest version seems to get stuck on a podcast every note and again, and won't play another podcast until it is shutdown and star_ratingted again. Other than that, works great.</review_text>

      <review_text>Every time I play a podcast, it freezes. Sometimes it'll actually play, but a lot of the time it simply crashes. Incredibly annoying.

      <review_text>I have one podcast that I listen to, and I had lots of problems adding it to my subscriptions. After that, the app worked great. EDIT: The problem was that adding the podcast through iTunes search had it stuck after selecting it, and adding through feed URL was taking a significantly long time as well (I think it was stuck). The latter eventually worked so I can't complain.</review_text>

      <review_title>Free &amp; clean, a bit buggy</review_title>
      <review_text>There aren't a lot of simple, easy to use podcatchers left, so this one is a breath of fresh air. That being said, there are some bugs that pop up from time to time. The app un-foregrounds itself sometimes after just pausing a podcast for a second. Sometimes I can't download an episode I know is fine in a feed. I've had it crash randomly. Hopefully as the app matures more, the kinks will be ironed out.</review_text>

      <review_title>Works well, BUT!</review_title>
      <review_text>It's ok, I think they may be attempting to incorporate more features and capabilities than what many of us really want or need. Like so many other developers out there need to understand, less can sometimes be just the right recipe to a fortune. Make a product which performs the basics then offer add-ons to allow the user to customize to suit the individual needs. Just remember, there are no instructions with most apps, isn't that just wrong? So, keep it simple to understand, then let the customer decide!</review_text>

      <review_title>Good, with some flaws.</review_title>
      <review_text>Great ad-free experience. Sometimes I encounter bugs where playback continues and I can't stop it. There have been other bugs in the past that have been squashed over time so I expect this will be done with in time. Really like the new search iTunes feature, it makes adding podcasts super easy.</review_text>

      <review_title>Simple but useful app</review_title>
      <review_text>You can manually add a podcast, or browse for some and the search function generally finds them all, playback is simple, although I wish the lock screen notification wouldn't go away when I paused it. Sometimes podcast refreshes take a long time, but other than that it's perfect 馃槉 plus being able to backup your podcast preferences is great!</review_text>

      <review_text>I really liked this app on the Z3. Unfortunately it does not work well with bluetooth-audio on Z5 (HSP via Mono Bluetooth Router pro). Sound is muted almost every time when the next episode star_ratingts... Not usable anymore.</review_text>

      <review_text>Originally used stitcher which was to but not all that great. Setup takes a bit longer in antenna pod than stitcher, but this app actually stores podcasts to sd card rather than holding then in the phones ram. Benefit: when you go on a 7 hour road trip you actually have something to listen to instead of only having the two podcast in your phones ram. This is simple with no ads. It just works!</review_text>

      <review_text>EDIT: thanks for the reply,I found the per podcast settings. It would be great if we had more options per podcast. E.g. to be able to set one podecast autoclean every 2 days, and another every 2 weeks. Other than that, it is an excellent app, stable, light, functional,intuitive, well designed, and has active devs. I tried a bunch of other podcast apps and I found this one to be the best for me. Furthermore, if you had a donate option I'm sure a bunch of us would chip in something.</review_text>

      <review_text>Very nice and light, what makes it stand out imo is no disturbing ads and player available as widget and lockscreen notification - so play and pause can easily be controlled without need to open the app when playing in the background or even unlock the phone when playing on the go. On the minus side, lacking some individual settings per subscription (for example on a daily cast I'd like to keep episodes for a couple of days but not a full week, and for a weekly at least a week) and some news podcasts with 1000s of old episodes take a bit long to load.</review_text>

      <review_text>This app is the prime example for an excellent open-source project. I'm just a little bit confused, how to remove pods from the queue, which are not played completely to the end. Because a different context menu will be shown. Sometimes I'm also unable to delete the last pod in the download list. The delete button is still there, but no action follows.</review_text>

      <review_text>Confusing as to what's downloaded and what's queued, some podcasts downloaded on wifi suddenly missing now that I'm on 4g. Multiple entries of same podcast. Fix this and I'll come back, going to something more straightforward in the interim.</review_text>

      <review_title>I'm using this simple solution, no doubt</review_title>
      <review_text>My main podcast finding, following, downloading, and listening app. No more messing with meta tags and scattered sources. Objectives of some features are still a little obscure to me (logs vs episodes vs queue) but I'm using it with 0 problems and with all the utility stated above. When I figure these additional features out I'm sure I'll be even more pleased. 2 thoughts: 1) tooltips might have helpful educational utility. 2) searching and adding podcasts isn't the prettiest.</review_text>

      <review_text>When I unplug it stops playing and I can plug in again the next day and it star_ratingts just where I left off (a few seconds earlier so I can pick it straight up again). I can filter by download or unheard. Finding new podcasts by url or searching the itunes store makes discovering new podcasts easy. I would like if I could group similar podcasts together or a people who downloaded this also downloaded... feature, but this isn't essential. Would definitely recommend to friends.</review_text>

      <review_text>While I like antennapod a lot and have been using it for years, it has finally failed me completely. It no longer plays my podcasts, particular ones from NPR. It has been getting worse in the last few months where it would fail to star_ratingt the podcast after one completes. It basically hangs and has be killed. I've star_ratingted to reboot, in hopes of clearing the problem, but that no longer works. I have a Nexus 5 freshly updated with latest Marshmallow. I usually try to find the download podcasts using the file manager, but I forgot where it was putting them. Please make it work reliably again. Thanks</review_text>

      <review_title>Good, simple podcast player</review_title>
      <review_text>It plays podcasts, manages a queue from subscription feeds, and has a few bells and whistles. It's almost a perfect app. The widget is a bit too simple, and large at the same time. The UI has an unrefined quirkiness that causes frequent irritations. But, it's free, it works, and if I wasn't so lazy I'd dive into the source. Thank you!</review_text>

      <review_title>Free and Open Source Podcatcher</review_title>
      <review_text>Antennapod has become everything I could want from a Podcatcher. star_ratingting from adding your first podcast, the GPodder integration means you will probably never have to search for an XML file again, since it will already be searchable in the gpodder directory. Other useful features include a sleep timer, excellent crash recovery (though crashes aren't that frequent), and headphone awareness. I'd recommend giving it a try before throwing a few bucks to another Podcatcher.</review_text>

      <review_text>The only aspect preventing me from leaving 5 star_ratings is the search feature is limited to iTunes or gpodder. Check Podcast Addict for that feature. 5 star_ratings when I don't have to use 2 apps to search for/enjoy my podcasts.</review_text>

      <review_text>Update: I got a same-day response pointing me to a setting that does exactly what I was asking for! It would be great if the notification didn't disappear when I tap the stop button. Usually I'm just stopping the playback temporarily during an interruption and I want to restar_ratingt playback after a few seconds or minutes. If the notification were still there I'd just press the play button to get going again. The Google Music player notification does this and I like it that way.</review_text>

      <review_title>Quirky at times but overall good!</review_title>
      <review_text>This app is not bug free, for instance around August 2015 it star_ratingted to crash when playing down loaded content, so I installed google play to do that. However, all of that is outweighed by the fact that this is OSS software, and I use it daily.</review_text>

      <review_text>This podcatcher app is better than the others I tried. It is also nice that the team continues to improve the app. Only frustration is app seems to still be unable to store podcasts on SDcard. App doesn't appear to have write permission due to Google's security features on Lollypop.</review_text>

      <review_title>Excellent Open Source App</review_title>
      <review_text>Looks good and runs simply. The app is constantly being updated, and if you submit bug reports or feature requests on their github they are fairly good about responding. Sometimes updates will introduce small bugs and the app is probably not the cutting edge in podcasting technology, but it is solid and always improving.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great app hope it keeps improving</review_title>
      <review_text>This app is great and has all the basic functionality that you look for in a podcasting app. I feel like there are some design optimizations that could be made to the user interface as it is a little clunky at the moment, especially the pullout drawer and the swiping behavior which is not very intuitive, at least to me. Also this might be a bug but the white icons and text are impossible to see on notifications. I also think adding more material design could improve the ui.</review_text>

      <review_text>Overall this is my favorite podcast player on Android. Easy to add feeds, and I like the way it manages them within the app. It allows for downloading episodes, and it remembers playback positions. Only downfall is that it sometimes becomes unresponsive, but a force stop usually resolves the problem.</review_text>

      <review_title>Quality app, great for multiple podcasts</review_title>
      <review_text>The only gripe I have about this app is the fact it doesn't do well when my cell signal is bad. I have an unlimited data plan so automatically downloading episodes would be a huge pain for me but if I have very little signal and I accidentally stop playback, I have to wait for it to star_ratingt to play again. Preferably the app would cache the episode as I play it so I wouldn't have to worry about it but I still have this issue. Also sometimes a random episode won't play. I have no idea why.</review_text>

      <review_text>For the advanced sleep timer, is it possible to extend the time window during which a phone shake will reset the timer?

      <review_text>WIth the latest update, it is now VERY difficult to re-arrange podcasts in the queue. The queue is the best feature of this podcast app, and it would be nice if it could be returned to the way it used to be. On the other hand, it now seems to work better with the play/pause button on my bluetooth headphones, so thanks for that.</review_text>

      <review_title>Functional, easy to use</review_title>
      <review_text>Only one real issue I have is that usually, but not always, when auto-advancing the playlist the player freezes. Pressing pause brings up an unknown error dialog, which then drops you back into the queue. Selecting a different podcast usually, but again not always, restores playback.</review_text>

      <review_text>Useless if you can't open it and use it!!! IN RESPONSE TO YOUR RESPONSE: I reinstalled it, but just how am I supposed to send you a crash report IF I CANNOT OPEN THE DANG APP???? I can't get anything except the Google play page that says it's installed. It doesn't show up on my phone except to say it's been successfully installed. No option to open the app, nor does it show up in phone as an app that I have.</review_text>

      <review_text>Android does not have the equivalent of I tunes when it comes to podcasts. I have been looking for a solution for almost a year and I finally found one. I would also like to mention that I have previously tried podcast addict and tunein but both were unsuccessful at providing a service that is comparable to this one.</review_text>

      <review_text>I've tried other major players around and I'm settling with thisone. Maybe I might want discovery, recommendation feature which I think, is missing but no complain as the player dose basics quite well. Free and no ads open source, I think this is a win. A note to the developers, I experience my xperia m4 freezes when I try to stream but the server is not responding ( download fails with 403 error or something)</review_text>

      <review_title>My favorite podcast manager</review_title>
      <review_text>I've been an Instacast user on iPhone for a long time and after migrating, it took me some time to find the right podcast manager for me on Android. After trying beyondpod, pocketcast and a couple more, I turned to the open source alternative Antennapod. What I like most is the Auto-Flattr feature. It allows me to contribute cash to my content creators and to Antennapod themselves - glad to be a part of it! Antennapod also has chapter marks, deals with big feeds and is highly customizable.</review_text>

      <review_text>I previously used AntennaPod with the Prestissimo plug-in, but when one or the other was upgraded, it killed functionality.

      <review_title>Great, but</review_title>
      <review_text>- if playback stops on the lockscreen, the contol panel disappears and replugging headphones does not resume playback anymore - missing sort and filter for the download queue (stop downloading all episodes of that one podcast - download episodes of multiple podcasts in the order they were published) - missing filter in all episodes -</review_text>

      <review_text>A great free alternative for some ofter podcast managers, however managing podcasts, especially deleting multiple ones is an inconvenient hassle. EDIT: okay, apparently they just added a feature to edit multiple episodes at once, thanks!! Changed my scoring.</review_text>

      <review_text>I came from an Apple iOS environment and this is the best Podcast app replacement I have found. I tried half a dozen until I came across AntennaPod, I found it when it had less than 10,000 downloads. I thought it was perfect from the beginning but every update has been surprisingly useful, especially the integration of iTunes search. Thank you so much Daniel for a superb app!</review_text>

      <review_title>Very good, question about adding podcasts with lots of existing episodes</review_title>
      <review_text>Hi there, This app is excellent, you guys are doing a great job. I have a question about using the app. I added a podcast that has over a hundred existing episodes. I would like to listen to it star_ratingting with the oldest episode first because it is a serial and I'd like to follow the storyline. Is adding each old episode to the queue manually the only way to listen oldest to newest? That's a lot of scrolling and clicking. The way I understand antennapod's use seems great for staying current with podcasts, but difficult for listening to old casts. Is there a way to use antennapod in that way? I saw on github a feature request to add all to queue, that would probably do it. Also, I tried emailing the google group but it bounced back. Thanks for your help, I greatly appreciate it.</review_text>

      <review_title>Update: Good, simple Podcast App</review_title>
      <review_text>In general, AP is a great, simple podcast app. There was previously an issue with how Podcasts were organised, but this has been fixed in a new update. The developers seem keen to fix issues and continue to improve the app. An area of improvement would be adding new podcasts: searching and browsing popular pods or recommendations would be useful.</review_text>

      <review_text>This app has come a very long way since i first star_ratingted using it. To tge point where if i decided i no longer believed in open source tomorrow i would keep using this app anyway. If you're looking for a podcasting app that's free and doesn't bloat your phone with ads and data collection, this is the way to go. If you're simply looking for an elegant podcast app, this is still the way to go.</review_text>

      <review_title>Simple and effective</review_title>
      <review_text>Does the job with no fuss no muss. Only minor request would be the option to turn off swipe to remove episodes - occasionally delete by mistake when using one handed navigation. Love it - thank you!</review_text>

      <review_text>If it supported chapters like in idevices would be brilliant but that's a proprietary thing anyway. iTunes support for library searching makes this a winner</review_text>

      <review_title>Flakey playback</review_title>
      <review_text>sometimes it works perfect sometimes it doesn't. there's no response to let you know you've clicked. if it stops for any reason such as you stop it, another apt interrupts it, or you lose your connection...there's only a 50 percent chance it's going to star_ratingt again. there's constant freezes where you have to wait 5 minutes even after you close it.</review_text>

      <review_title>great app</review_title>
      <review_text>This app needs configuring on first use to work well. Once configured properly this is the best podcast app I have used. Straight-forward but full featured. There are a few minor bugs here and there which can be overlooked. Adding more podcasts than the choices listed seems difficult and possibly buggy; it probably requires reading some instructions which I did not read.</review_text>

      <review_text>A great free app with almost all the functions required from a podcasts app. Popular podcasts are easy to find and those that aren't can be added through the feed URL.

      <review_title>Great podcatcher</review_title>
      <review_text>Excellent open-source podcatcher with good feature set and OPML import, so you don't have to use a service! The new material interface looks good and could be even better with a few tweaks.</review_text>

      <review_title>Best android podcatcher</review_title>
      <review_text>Not the prettiest but certainly the most reliable podcatcher available on play store. The open podcast database it uses always finds what im looking for. I wish the automatic downloading had a bit more options and the podcast sorting was a bit more flexible but this is by far the most reliable and robust podcatcher ive tried. Others miss episodes or download in weird orders or at inappropriate times. That doesnt happen with antennapod. I highly recommend this outstanding app!</review_text>

      <review_title>Don't ever lose internet connection</review_title>
      <review_text>If you lose network connection at any time, such as due to a wifi deadspot, it won't only pause the podcast you're paying, even if it's pre downloaded, it will take full control of your phone abd lock out any and all actions. No home button, no volume control, no lock screen, etc. Until it either reconnect or times out (about thirty seconds). This is completely unacceptable, as a college student who walks around campus, and my internet will constantly go in and out.</review_text>

      <review_text>Changed from an iPhone to android, so have limited experience of podcast apps. All I really want to do is find the podcasts I like, download, listen &amp; delete. I couldn't find the BBC casts I wanted without the URL, so I had to find the URL. I can't delete the episodes I've listened to, they just sit in the list. Maybe I'm just not using it right, but a few instructions would be welcome.</review_text>

      <review_title>App runs in the background using rescources</review_title>
      <review_text>I love this podcast app, and have used it for quite some time. However, since the last update, it runs constantly in the background. I have changed the settings to update manually, but it still shows the icon in the task bar that it is syncing podcasts several times a day. I looked at the battery options in settings and this app is listed in the #2 spot for resource usage. Unfortunately, I am uninstalling it until this is fixed.</review_text>

      <review_text>FOSS FTW. Works great. Been using it for 6 months. EDIT: Well it took me more than a month, but something between this app and Prestissimo was causing a CPU lock and up to 15%/hr battery drain. I've locked this app out of wake locks and from keep awake, uninstalled Prestissimo, and now I'm getting 1%/hr drain. Not sure where the fault is, but I'm not taking star_ratings away as I could not do without this app.</review_text>

      <review_text>I love supporting FOSS software, but this app has some flaws. It is a bit buggy. Sometimes pages and the menu turns all white as if the app is just a shell with no content. Other times, I will try searching for podcasts by category only to get a 404 error.</review_text>

      <review_title>Does the job well</review_title>
      <review_text>A clean, elegant interface that does not look cheap. Unlike some apps designed for phones it looks good on a tablet too. It does a good job as a podcast player, rather than also trying to do lots of other things and failing.</review_text>

      <review_text>Love the app, but since update or maybe update of Android, some podcasts stop halfway and afterwards it and other podcasts will not star_ratingt playing (even after force stopping app and restar_ratingting app)!</review_text>

      <review_title>The best podcast app paid or free.</review_title>
      <review_text>While this app is still in beta, the interface is beautiful, works well, and it seamlessly imported opml from doggcatcher. I've paid for doggcatcher, tried pocketcasts and beyondpod, and this is the best I've ever used. Still needs to save podcast position when closed and the app is killed.</review_text>

      <review_title>Getting better, sometimes</review_title>
      <review_text>This app has been getting better and better, but it's not quite where I'm thrilled with it. I haven't found another podcast app that I'm happier with, yet. The new UI feels a little more intuitive, but the ability to add an episode to queue now takes too many clicks - I generally want to add to queue instead of download, so the big download button doesn't do it for me and instead is a waste of space!</review_text>

      <review_text>This app has a good, clean interface that makes it simple to add feeds and just listen to what I want. It can be a little buggy at times (have never successfully completed a download, even on a solid connection), and the new UI could use as little refinement, but overall it does the job.</review_text>

      <review_text>I use this app every day, it was the best podcast app I'd found, would have given it 4/5 star_ratings. However, the new UI messed up the simple &amp; straightforward approach it used to have - it's now fiddly and counterintuitive. Really don't like the more complicated UI change!</review_text>

      <review_title>New version has some big drawbacks</review_title>
      <review_text>Two major things were good with the previous UI and are bad in the new one: 1. There's no way to tell the length of a podcast in the queue before you star_ratingt playing it. There's not even a file size indication. For my usage this is a big negative, add I'm planning my choice of episodes based on the time available. 2. The pop-up window showing episode details now spans almost the entire screen, leaving a very narrow area to touch in order to leave it, effectively forcing me to use the back button.</review_text>

      <review_title>Clear, simple, mostly intuitive</review_title>
      <review_text>I really like the simplicity. Popular apps like Podcast Addict and Podcast Republic display often useless information, like last time podcast was checked for updates. All podcast apps always check for updates when you run them, so that's just clutter. It feel like I have to go 5 menus deep to do basic tasks with the others, and 3 menus is a bad as it gets with antenna pod. The one place I would offer criticism however: searching for podcast should be default, with an option to use the other methods.</review_text>

      <review_text>New UI looks good. But where are enquire all new and download all buttons? Do I have to enqueue each episode one by one (it's now 4 clicks for each of them)? And why did you hide length of episode?</review_text>

      <review_title>New UI Far Less Intuitive and Generates Lockups</review_title>
      <review_text>The new UI is significantly worse than the pre-May 31 interface. With the old interface it was easy to see the organization of podcasts. The new interface destroyed that view, making it hard to find what I want to listen to. But the biggest problem is that the new update seems to lock up my phone for no reason. I have had to pull the battery twice today in order to get my phone working again. For me, this is a real disaster. If not fixed soon, I'll move on to a different podcast manager.</review_text>

      <review_text>This is still a decent podcast aggregate, but the new UI is a step backwards. Being able to see all of the review_titles subscribed to, then click into each and see the available episodes was very good - I can't seem to do that anymore. I'm still using this app, but it's a bit fiddly now.</review_text>

      <review_text>So it works reasonably, but it doesn't auto download, takes a full minute to star_ratingt, and doesn't quit so it drags down my battery. Just can't tolerate the challenges anymore.</review_text>

      <review_title>Simple, efficient, and free</review_title>
      <review_text>Podcasts are efficiently downloaded, hassle-free. No obtrusive ads either. I like the fact that downloads can be saved to the external sd card. If you create an account with gpodder, all podcasts subscriptions can be synchronized to the cloud. Then on another device, simply download and install the opml file in your favorite podcatcher to have the same podcasts.</review_text>

      <review_text>Am I misunderstanding how to use the app, or is the search completely broken? I try typing the names of lots of popular podcasts into the search, but it finds nothing. No results were found. So unfortunately I can't try this app any further.</review_text>

      <review_title>Best podcast downloader</review_title>
      <review_text>***Request: portrait video support.***This is closest thing to gpodder for Android that I could find. It doesn't have too many options and it WORKS (for the most part). The only issue I have with the app is that it doesn't download youtube podcasts. I imported my opml from gpodder and my youtube feeds work there, so that is really the only issue I have with this app. It is still great t be able to download my podcast straight to my phone though. Thanks for a great app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Search broken</review_title>
      <review_text>I read good things about AntennaPod while researching alternatives to the long in the tooth BeyondPod. However, the search feature is slow and littered with multiple listings for individual podcasts, most of which are out of date. That's if you're lucky enough for it to provide results at all. I never managed to get a feed added so I can't review_text on its functionality as a player.</review_text>

      <review_title>Decent But Flawed</review_title>
      <review_text>This application is extremely basic - which is not necessarily a 'bad' thing. It just doesn't seem to perform those basics well, e.g. when I have paused a podcast and returned at a later time...I don't currently see a way to star_ratingt it again. There is no 'play' button, and the only available option is 'skip.' It also won't let me delete a podcast in mid-play unless I 'skip' it.</review_text>

      <review_title>Seltsames Update...</review_title>
      <review_text>Das letzte Update (29.3.) muss gefixt werden. Kann meine Feeds nicht mehr aktualisieren weil die App f眉r jeden einzelnen Podcasteintrag ein Bild herunterladen will. Das sind bei meinen 25 Feeds 1500+ Bildchen die zwar meist (wie es auch sein sollte) nur ein paar kB, teilweise jedoch mehrere MB gro脽 sind. Ich verstehe dass das nett in der Feedansicht aussieht, aber das ist mir weder mein Speicherplatz wert noch die Zeit die meine kl盲gliche 2000er Leitung braucht um das zu ziehen.</review_text>

      <review_text>Using 644m But! Phone rotation on video play cuts off video. Autodelete gone? Please turn off star_ratingt on boot. Also, when opening files from file explorers AP launches? Streaming certain episodes, eg http://indybay.org/newsitems/2013/03/01/18732943.php unknown error? Thanks new ui! Would love a distinction between episodes listened to (old) and else(new/DL'd). also:I'm traveling w/o access to wifi/3g, so my phone is connected via reverse tether so no-go.

      <review_text>This is a very promising podcast player, even in beta, and it is open source, awesome! I feel it could stand some improvements in simplifying the UI, and some things can be a bit hidden. The queue system is also a bit unintuitive to me, I would much prefer just a simple list of recent podcasts ordered by date, an option to do this would be amazing. Icing on the cake would be a way to favourite episodes. Great work though devs!</review_text>

      <review_title>The only podcast app I need</review_title>
      <review_text>I'm changing my review because my only complaint (podcasts being sorted by downloaded date instead of published date) has a good workaround. The feature of being able to re-order the episodes manually actually works better for me than any purely automated sort would. Plus, since my review, a second podcast directory was added to the Add Podcast screen, which makes finding new content even easier.</review_text>

      <review_text>Could be great but still feels incomplete. No downloading progress in status bar. Seems to have weird bugs for example I was downloading an episode but didn't know if it was actually downloading as I couldn't see a progress bar so I tapped the download again and then when I found the download section it was downloading the episode twice. Surely the app would know that episode is already downloading and wouldn't download again.</review_text>

      <review_text>This podcast app works wonderfully, has all the options you need, and doesn't cost much. I'd be using this, if I hadn't already paid for pocket casts, which in my opinion has a (very) slightly better UI.</review_text>

      <review_title>Necessary features lacking</review_title>
      <review_text>1) no way to know what you've listened to. 2) no auto delete when you've finished a pod, which is another reason it's hard to know what you've already listened to. 3) very unintuitive. Clicking directly on a cast brings up the show notes of all things. To actually play or delete a file you have to find a little drop down arrow menu. Checking a file as read or unread is extremely erratic. Files are not automatically checked as unread so you have to manually check them. Then th</review_text>

      <review_text>Moved to this from PodKicker +WiFi integration seamless, updates podcasts smoothly when I log in - updates across mobile network not turned on by default. +Search for podcasts straightforward - maybe more obscure would be tricky but I found all of mine no snags +All prog info, artwork downloaded +can set podcast download folder to SD card and not bung up phone memory -Queue not intuitive but I found a ref on the web and have now realised how to drag/drop into order . -All downloads are automatically added to the queue so it is a long list some way of sorting it would be a good idea -documentation skimpy to say the least, but then it is beta and free! -does not automatically delete listened to podcasts (but they go off queue) which is surprising as most podcast apps do this, some housekeeping functions seems overdue Usable in current state with clear development potential. If you are happy to play around and look online for info it is a good option. I will not be returning to podkicker</review_text>

      <review_text>Installed and opened with no errors, so that's worth 2 star_ratings. When subscribing, instead of having groups of podcasts (with all the TWiT or 5by5 ones listed together for example) I had to scroll thru vague categories with long lists of pods and never did find find what I was looking for. Didn't see a way to search alphabetically either so uninstalled without subscribing to anything.</review_text>

      <review_text>AntennaPod is a great FOSS podcast player. Been using it for a while now and have enjoyed the experience, for the most part. Some things that need improvement: Ability to skip ahead or back by 30 seconds (or some other interval, configurable preferable). Improve the widget. It's really basic and I'd like to see the Artwork displayed and it too often doesn't let me play a podcast I paused listening to. Search is lacking. I have a hard time finding podcasts on it that have been on the Web for years.</review_text>

      <review_text>It's nice looking, easy to use, has great list management and automation options. If I had to deduct points, it would be for an occasionally inconsistent UI; with main functions buried in context menus, leading to some strangeness like not being able to play a podcast you've downloaded unless you go back to list view. Overall though, best podcast app available for the platform.</review_text>

      <review_title>Awesome!</review_title>
      <review_text>After trying a few different podcatchers, this is the one I stuck with. Simple interface, I can stream or download, and a simple widget for faster playing. The only thing I would like to see is Video-cast support. Still a great app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Best just got better.</review_title>
      <review_text>When Google Listen shut down, I star_ratingted using AntennaPod right away. It was my favorite from the star_ratingt, but what made me post this review is that the developer just added the option to change the playback speed of the podcast. It took this from a good app to an AWESOME app. Five star_ratings, keep it up.</review_text>

      <review_text>Best Google Listen replacement, free and open source, thriving communitytI have used Google Listen from when I got my Android phone to when the Google Reader service was discontinued. I tried BeyondPod and AntennaPod before the service ended and decided to stick with AntennaPod. They are both good, but I thought AntennaPod was a better Google Reader replacement. But maybe the fact that it is free and open source, has a thriving community on GitHub, and does not cost you a penny made me biased. See for yourself!</review_text>

      <review_text>Some errors when downloading but usually spot on. would benefit from a sync function that shared podcast libraries between platforms such as phone and PC as adding/updating each can be a pain. the add podcast function is also very limited. in short a really good app with room to develop further.</review_text>

      <review_text>The only reason I was able to come across this app was because of it's open-source credentials (found it on F-Droid, but downloaded it from here.) It's a perfect replacement to Google Listen, with improvements in all the areas Listen was lacking. Hopefully 5 star_rating ratings will star_ratingt helping this app show up more quickly amongst all the bloated pay apps.</review_text>

      <review_text>I think it's great, but I really wish there was a help file of some sort. I'm just lost as to how I end up at random screens. I think I'm downloading something but then I find I was streaming it. It's auto downloading podcasts from weeks ago and not the current. And just when I think I understand the icons I find I'm off base. I typically just tap on buttons at random till my podcast star_ratingts playing,but at least it finally plays.</review_text>

      <review_text>OPML import still requires copying of the OPML file to a specific folder (no browsing to the file for easy import) and searching is turrible (!) but other than that, this app is one function away from becoming my no. 1 podcast app. The one thing: I need a feed for 'new' podcasts (see podkicker). Right now, going podcast by podcast to look for new episodes is a little silly, and with searching being so bad I cannot give up podkicker. But.. I am a fan.</review_text>

      <review_title>Clean interface</review_title>
      <review_text>I like the interface and look of this podcast player a lot, and the fact that it has some lockscreen controls is a huge plus for it. In terms of what I'd like to see improved, there are a few things. First, an easier way to add podcasts would be nice, like some kind of directory to search through. I had to add This American Life by pasting in the URL rather than using a search or selection activity. Second, adding fast-forward and rewind to the lockscreen would be good. Third, selection of items is a little clunky, and it takes too many clicks to perform operations on items in the list. One should be able to mark something unread in two clicks, but it takes three because the menu doesn't pop up automatically after selection. Fourth, marking things read/unread, adding and removing to the queue, and managing the downloaded/not downloaded statuses of all of the items isn't as easy as it could be. It's kind of a pain to have to separately manage all of these statuses independently. Also, auto-removal from the queue seems to work, but auto-removal from the device doesn't seem to work. And lastly, auto-downloading of items would be nice. Overall though, a great app!</review_text>

      <review_text>I've bought a few others, but AntennaPod is my current favorite. The most glaring issue I can find at the moment is the inability to sort the play queue. Chrono, reverse, random, grouped by shows... these would be good options, for star_ratingters.</review_text>

      <review_text>I used to use Pocket Casts, but downloaded this to give it a try. So far, so good. Some things to note: * Auto refresh seems broken. * Can't search for or specify an OPML file for import. Must put it in a specific folder. * Can't specify a time to refresh. * UI is very clean and easy to navigate. I love the dark theme!</review_text>

      <review_text>This app lacks some of the features of the better known podcasting apps, but it's early in development and it's very good at the things that it does. Also a very clean, holo theme interface which is nice. The only podcasting app that looks better is Pocket Casts, but that app has been unreliable downloading podcast episodes for me lately so I've been using AntennaPod as my daily podcast listening app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Minimalist. Beautiful.</review_title>
      <review_text>I've tried the majority of the podcast apps and online radio/streaming apps available. None really caught my attention until I discovered AntennaPod. Open source and Holo themed? Heck yes! It's (currently) very basic, but it gets the job done and that's what counts. It downloads and/or streams and plays podcast feeds. As basic as you can get. The only area where I would say it needs improvement (and I foresee this being addressed eventually in a future update) is regarding searching/browsing for podcasts feeds. The Browse Miro Guide is rather limited and for people unfamiliar with manually adding feeds this will prevent them from easily finding the majority of the more popular podcast out there.</review_text>

      <review_title>Best podcast app by far</review_title>
      <review_text>For so long I was tortured by Pocket Casts and other awful, pre-gingerbread apps. Thanks for the rescue! Gorgeous interface, fantastic playback, great integration, OPML import. Only feature I could think of would be a fixed time (e. g. 3am) to star_ratingt the downloads. However, it's open source, so I guess I could do this myself. :)</review_text>

      <review_text>The app is very cleanly designed and follows the new Holo app design guidelines nicely.

      <review_title>Unfinished.</review_title>
      <review_text>First thing out of the box, OPML Import wants some arcane directory and filename. Why no file picker? Not a good first impression. Even worse, once I imported feeds, it became obvious this thing is almost useless. No auto download of newest episodes, no options on a per feed basis of how many episodes to keep, etc. I do not have the time to manually download and queue everything. All the basic functions I expect of a podcatcher, no it doesn't have that. Too simple to be of much use. Back to doggcatcher. It may be ugly but it works.</review_text>

      <review_text>Has a few bugs but it's far better than any other podcast app I've tried. Only really major issue is that adding episodes with the search function does work well. This isn't that big an issue unless you have lots of podcasts since you can just paste in the RSS URLs.</review_text>

      <review_text>This app looks fantastic but really lacks in ease of setup. I installed and clicked the button to add a podcast and my only options were to input the URL, browse by category with very limited entries or import an opml list. So I went to my other podcast player and exported the list then when I tried to import it I was told it needed to be in some weird directory 5 levels down instead of letting choose the file I wanted. Once I got it set up it worked really well. I don't look forward to adding new podcasts.</review_text>

      <review_text>To import and OPML file you have to copy it into a specific (and rather obscure) directory.

      <review_title>Great app, but one key feature is missing.</review_title>
      <review_text>The ability to sync feeds and read counts across multiple devices would make this app a 5-star_rating winner.</review_text>

      <review_title>Best so far!</review_title>
      <review_text>Good and beautiful! Some pointers: Search is a little thin, only found 50% of the podcasts i listen to. It should star_ratingt playing when tapping an episode in the episode list and would also be great to mark episodes as listened. I'm going for this player, best so far!</review_text>

      <review_title>The Best!</review_title>
      <review_text>This is one of the best podcast apps hands down. Very nice, clean, and appealing UI. It functions just like it's supposed to and gives the listener the option to either download or stream. Only problem with it is the Miro Guide, it has a small selection but if you can't find what you're looking for just go to the Miro website and find your selections URL and you're set.</review_text>

      <review_title>Cool App</review_title>
      <review_text>This is by far the best looking free podcast app I've found. The interface is pretty minimal, but it has pretty much every feature I'm interested in. Another thing I really like is that it doesn't require a million seeming unrelated permissions like the more popular podcast apps do. Definitely worth checking out now that Google has discontinued Listen.</review_text>

      <review_text>I wanted to like this app a lot, as it looks good and is minimalistic In a good way. However, I did have problems with one feed, but another worked well. It's worth giving it a shot.</review_text>
