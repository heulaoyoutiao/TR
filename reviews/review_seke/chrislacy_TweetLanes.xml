      <review_title>Crashes when attaching images...</review_title>
      <review_text>Finally decided to give this app a proper try and, well, as the review_title says, it just crashes every time I try to attach an image to a tweet. Looks like it's not been updated for a while either so will likely just try something else.</review_text>

      <review_text>I've been using for a long time and would give it 5 star_ratings but it is no longer working and not getting fixed. Crashes when you select pictures and links in tweets just linking to the tweet they are embedded in. Uninstalling</review_text>

      <review_title>Great app but needs inprovement</review_title>
      <review_text>I would give this app 5 star_ratings if it did not freeze up which is quite frequent and if there were a way to block bullies and trolls. They are more prevalent than ever on twitter. This a a much needed feature. Other than these issues it's the best twitter app by far.</review_text>

      <review_title>Hasn't been updated since Oct 2014</review_title>
      <review_text>Force closes when opening a picture with Marshmallow. If it could be fixed I'd definitely stay with this app, however this hasn't received an update for a year and a half now, and seems forgotten. Time to move on I guess, shame, loved this app. UPDATE: Tried the official Twitter app, it's rubbish!! Now using TwitPane and it's really good.</review_text>

      <review_text>Many other annoying Twitter apps out there, want money, provide ads, and just make it inconvenient to use. I have switched to yours as I no longer trust Twitter's own with access to my contacts. Thank you for the work you've done on this.</review_text>

      <review_title>Good - except on Marshmallow</review_title>
      <review_text>I've used this as my twitter client for a long time. Works great, excepting it doesn't really work if you want to see reactions to a tweet for people that you don't follow. That doesn't work. With Android Marshmallow, the non updates to this so really show. If you click on a picture, it crashes. Maybe time to move on</review_text>

      <review_text>Like Tweet Deck. Good customizability. I didn't find an option to make the tab labels into icons. I actually hate the constantly open compose tweet taking up valuable space. Incoming long DM's are shortened into links. This would be almost perfect if those few things changed.</review_text>

      <review_title>It's great but</review_title>
      <review_text>You can't mute someone you follow or mute just one person's retweets. This is something I find really useful on Tweetcaster, which I'm not using atm because their link system is messed up after their latest update. If they fix it I'll probably go back but it would only be for these two features.</review_text>

      <review_text>It's quite good, but I had to uninstall. There is simply no ability for longer than 140 tweets. Plume, Tweetcaster, and UberSocial, all work with Twitlonger, but they all have annoying problems. If Tweetlanes simply added Twitlonger support, it'd be heads above others. It's crucial that I have this, so... sorry.</review_text>

      <review_text>Good app but a few small annoyances. It's a bit slow to load tweets however once it has it does load a lot more than other Twitter apps. Also only loads a certain number of tweets and then I have to wait for a while before I can load the rest. If these could be sorted I would rate it a 5.</review_text>

      <review_text>I wasn't impressed with this app at all it took entirely too long for my timeline mentions refreshing my page etc to pop up which makes this app useless to me I have to say this is the worst Twitter app I've tried so far the best I've tried was tweetcaster far as design its perfect an easy to use but it also has its problems but despite its problems it still beats out the rest of them if they ever fix those problems like lagging don't always show RTS etc tweetcaster would be by far the best Twitter app ever</review_text>

      <review_text>If you clear the cache often, then images generally load okay, but who wants to do that. Please fix! Otherwise a great app. This image issue became too much of a burden. Had to uninstall it and move on to the next app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great app! Just missing a little something.</review_title>
      <review_text>The only thing reason I did not give this a five-star_rating rating is because it lacks the ability to organize lanes into the order I'd like to see them. It gets a bit tedious swiping continuously to get to the lane I want. Otherwise, this is an excellent app.</review_text>

      <review_text>Once you follow 50 people you can no longer follow or UN-follow anyone.The UN-follow button disappears. Does not show how many people star_ratingred the tweet.Missing basic functionalities but overall it's a great alternative to stock Twitter .</review_text>

      <review_text>Sure it LOOKS like Holo, but somehow it feels like a soulless copy more than anything else. Functionally it's average and pretty nondescript, really. There's better clients out there, but certainly a LOT of much worse ones as well.</review_text>

It doesn't seem to accept my password even though I know I am entering it correctly, then it just keeps taking me back to the Twitter login screen. Anyone else experiencing this? Any explanation as to why? Help!! -------------------------------------- I never thought I'd find a twitter client that I liked as much as tweetdeck, but here it is! Thanks Chris!</review_text>

      <review_title>Pretty good.</review_title>
      <review_text>Very handy app, but the rate limits are killing the experience. Post more than 4 or 5 tweets in a couple of minutes and you have to wait up to 10 minutes for your timeline to refresh. No other client app has done this me.</review_text>

      <review_text>But I can't seem to find any Follow button anywhere. I deleted the official Twitter app because this is better and a lot more lighter. I just hope there's a way to see who favorited your tweets. Will give this a five if it has an accompanying widget.</review_text>

      <review_text>I liked the format, but it was really slow; never got notifications. Had a big problem with Direct Messages. They need to refresh when they come in because you can't continue to check for a new message without getting locked out.</review_text>

      <review_text>Very nice app with good UI except for the bottom tweet bar which stays there and takes screen size. And even bat is thick IMO,could be made a little thinner to provide more screen space. A part from that very smooth scrolling and nice app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Would love to use it all the time, but can't</review_title>
      <review_text>I've been using Tweet Lanes for about a month and like the design and what the developer is trying to do. If you just want to use it to look at your timeline, view your profile and your tweets/retweets/mentions then this will work for you. Unfortunately I use lists to manage Twitter, and this app is very inconsistent with this functionality. Sometimes I can go to the settings and see my lists and add them in to the main app. Then the lists disappear from the main app and when I go into settings, they have disappeared from there too, so I can add them back in. This happens daily. I also can't seem to add or manage those lists from the app, so afraid I'm back to my unsupported Falcon Pro app for Twitter for now.</review_text>

      <review_text>Predominantly used tweetdeck for twittter accounts, this could be an awesome alternative/replacement. Slight lag compared to normal twitter app, but I can live with that.

      <review_text>Pro: Clean interface with an instant-messaging feel. Con: The interface is a bit buggy and there's no widget yet. A night-mode or black theme would be lovely too.</review_text>

      <review_text>*This* is what an Android app can/should be. It doesn't try to mimic an iPhone app, with curved surfaces and such. It adheres nicely to the design guidelines and produces a beautiful app that is a pleasure to use, and (unlike the competition) a pleasure to read. I absolutely *love* the contextual Tweet bar, and the multi-tweet select. Fantastic. I can wait for the notifications--after searching for days, this is the best Twitter client for Android--period.</review_text>

      <review_text>I did notice that tap and hold yo select tweets doesn't usually work. I have to tap to the individual tweet screen and then retweet or whatever. It's weird that the @Mentions section shows random tweets from people you follow but didn't @ you. I also wish that when you viewed your own profile, it would display like a preview of the web version with the background and headline image. Not a major issue at all though.</review_text>

      <review_title>Solid.</review_title>
      <review_text>Lack of the ability to mute by individual user, or mute at all, loses a star_rating. Otherwise, a fine app that works well.</review_text>

      <review_title>Decent, bit lacking on features</review_title>
      <review_text>Looks wise this is really nice, and it's fast and stable. I like the interface - being able to select multiple tweets to reply to is a particularly nice touch! But it desperately needs a few more features. Being able to mute hashtags/users/etc is a MUST, trending topics would be good, adding your own column/lane would be nice. It's close to perfect, honestly, a few more features and this would be a contender for definitive android twitter app.</review_text>

      <review_text>I like it, lightweight and have most features I need. Though it isn't stable enough, it crashes a lot, and most the times refuses to open embedded images (gives an error message without an option to reload, same image shows well on other twitter apps and web). A feature I used frequently on other apps is posting to facebook by the way (no facebook time lane, I would actually opt to not allow it, just the possibility to _selectevly_ make posts as I tweet)</review_text>

      <review_text>looks great, navigation is easy and smooth; only complaints are that it needs vine support, i'd like it to show when people have fav'd my tweets, and it doesn't show people's tweets in my timeline if they're directed at a specific person.</review_text>

      <review_text>The app has basically everything I've been looking for. You can do everything the original Twitter app can and you also have columns too, and finally, a third party Twitter app that let's you view who retweeted you.

      <review_title>One my top 3 fav twitter clients!</review_title>
      <review_text>I love Tweet Lanes because it does what other twitter clients rarely (or don't) do, such as: can customize how I want my Tweet Lanes would be by customizing columns, easily block or report as spam people in my timeline just by few clicks, see who retweeted a tweet and which my tweets that are retweeted by people. Rated 4 star_ratings because it doesn't have a really important feature: muting people. I will rate 5 star_ratings if you enable this or reply to my feedback email that sent to you :D</review_text>

      <review_text>It's a great app.. I love it. But there are a few features where improvements and bug fixes would help. Chief among them being, when I share something from another app, the tweet gets prepended with the word 'null'. I've seen this with dropbox and feedly. Due to this bug I'm still not using this as my main Twitter app.. hope to return to tweetlanes soon</review_text>

      <review_title>Annoying</review_title>
      <review_text>Pretty UI, but how come I get a Rate limit exceeded warning just at the time I run the app? That's pretty annoying. If that would be fixed, together with the possibility of muting users, that would make this a really great app. Right now it's completely useless with the Rate limit exceeded warning just popping out whenever I run the app. And please, the app icon should be changed. It gives a false impression about the pretty UI.</review_text>

      <review_text>Out of all the twitter clients I've tried this is one of the best. The only thing stopping it from becoming my main twitter client is the low res inline images. All images look a bit blurry so I end up having to visit the mobile twitter site to view then properly. I'm really hoping this can be addressed in the next update. Great work Chris!</review_text>

      <review_text>I'm a Twitter vet but not as rabid a fan as I used to be. I needed quick, full featured and no bloat! I've tried them all and bought several. This app is quick, does all I want and does it well. 3MB including data files for 2 accounts AND show all my replies, RTs and lists! Wow! :-) LOVE it so far, will watch to see if data continues to increase forever (no I don't mean flushable cache). If it doesn't bloat over time I will forget Plume Pro and Seesmic Pro &amp; ONLY use this. I highly recommend TweetLanes.</review_text>

      <review_text>Has the potential to be the best Twitter app. Love how things just work, things that other apps have taken a while to implement. Needs trends and notifications, which I'm sure must be coming. Also the ability to change the ordering of the lanes would be great. Integrating Tweet Lanes into Action Launcher somehow would benefit both apps greatly. Top dev, keep at it.. your hard work is paying off!</review_text>

      <review_text>Loved the simplicity of tweet lanes when I first tried it. Then the follow button disappeared so I couldn't follow anybody new.

      <review_text>PRO: Beautiful design, lots of interface/customize options that make it a true pleasure to use. Smooth and mostly lag free. My favorite out of them all - that I cannot use! CONS: No User auto-complete, Follow/Unfollow not working?, No Notifications, No option for longer tweets. This app has the opportunity to be the best for Android; but some key features are needed.</review_text>

      <review_text>I loved it until I realized there's no settings for notifications. That was really a bummer. Add notifications &amp; it might get 5 star_ratings, but for now it's cool to use with the official Twitter app. I have an S3 btw.</review_text>

      <review_text>Although I know it could use some fine tuning, like notifications and a few customizable things, it saddens me that the developer had to stop the progress of this app. I think it would have been at the head of the pack as far as twitter apps go.</review_text>

      <review_text>TweetLanes was my favourite client because I can read my lists! That feature coped with the lack of other basic ones like notifications or autocomplete. Removing lists is nonsense. I'll have to take a look at the code and see what happened, now that it's been open sourced.</review_text>

      <review_text>Sure this was great when it came out. But even then it was missing a lot of features. The settings are thin and there are no notifications. Can't tweet @ someone without memorizing their twitter handle. Its also clear the developer has abandoned this app as he is focused on his launcher now. Its a shame, this was promising but it remains 1 star_rating until it is completed.</review_text>

      <review_text>Doesn't fill the screen on my Nexus 7 properly, no option to filter tweets for images or videos and not quite as smooth as it should be. Overall has a lot of promise - just not ready to replace my main twitter client yet.</review_text>

      <review_title>It used to be great</review_title>
      <review_text>I really used to like this application so much. I also tried to encourage everyone I know to try it because what a good features it brought in the beginning. But, later it stops there update &amp; it become an old app. I tried to contact the developer many times through his account in Twitter but everytime he ignored my question &amp; never replay. I advice to try other Twitter client like Falcon Pro or continue using the official app which is much better than this application.</review_text>

      <review_title>Update To My review</review_title>
      <review_text>This is a great twitter client. however, the updates seem to have stopped, according to the changelog and the reviews. Is this app still being worked on? I also believe notifications should be a staple feature for such a great app. Adding.Facebook/G+/Tumblr post integration would just be icing on an already good cake. :) /Edit/ App has begun to show signs of instability. Keeps kicking me out when I wanna scroll thru tweets! Had to knock off a star_rating for that.</review_text>

      <review_text>Decent twitter client. Just needs the stuff that everyone else is already asking for (notifications, delete tweets, widget, etc.). Get that sorted and it's an easy five star_rating. Too bad it seems that the dev doesn't work on this app anymore. It could have been great.</review_text>

I will rate 5 only if there's notification, translation, able to delete own tweets and uploading of images. Get it done please! It's a real 5star_ratings app for it with all those mentioned features I given.</review_text>

      <review_text>I was looking for a twitter client with fast push notification for mention and new direct message and I believed I haven't found any that suits my need. So I ended up trying almost every application I can find here on the app store. Tweetlanes couldnt provide me with that as well but when I tried it, I feel happy with the Retweets of Me feature as it has shown me my tweets that haven been retweeted by others for quite a long range of time(line). 4* for the feature :)</review_text>

      <review_title>good twitter app!</review_title>
      <review_text>Notifications plus ability to rearrange the lanes and account modifications would make this app better than the rest! theres a few small formatting bits with the lane review_titles where the full review_title doesnt appear. Right now its really good for viewing and posting, but not necessarily enough for me to go ahead and uninstall the original twitter app just yet since i still use it to change my profile pic, accepting follower requests, and other mods.</review_text>

      <review_text>I like the app.. I could see this being my regular Twitter app, but it does not have trending topics and that is a feature of Twitter that I enjoy.. if added I'll give 5 star_ratings</review_text>

      <review_text>Sorry to see that it will loose support soon. This is my favorite twitter app for Jellybean. It follows Google's design guidelines, and is very very stable for a beta. There are some features that could be added, but overall it does everything that I need it to (I'm a very light twitter user). Great job to the developer!</review_text>

      <review_title>So Close</review_title>
      <review_text>This was poised to be the king of Twitter apps when it first began. I was happy being a beta tester, etc. We were always told Notifications are being worked on! They're next!, but then came his next project, Action Launcher. Unfortunately, Tweet Lanes was put on the back burner and now it's been over 2 months since the last update. Don't get me wrong - I'm very appreciative of the app, even in its current state. I Judy wish it had notifications. Maybe some day. Until then, I'll sick with TweakDeck.</review_text>

      <review_title>My Twitter app of choice</review_title>
      <review_text>To me, this is basically TweetDeck, with better UX, in a Holo theme. Works great. I love that I can display certain lists as columns. Something almost every other app is missing. Lack of notifications isn't a big deal to me, I just use the official Twitter app or Echofon for notifications, but generally dismiss them and open up TweetLanes. It's a pity Twitter's API limits means nobody else can join in on using it, and as a result development may decline.</review_text>

      <review_text>The best twitter app I've had the pleasure of using. The only one to pry Tweetdeck from my phone, even though it hadn't been updated in years. Now, due to Twitter's 100,000 user cap, development has as good as stopped, which is a real shame. Damn you Twitter!</review_text>

      <review_text>The app lacks some features like notifications and giving suggestions when you search for someone or something ( like in twitter official app) also the app crashes some times which is a little bit annoying thing.

      <review_title>Great UI ...</review_title>
      <review_text>... looks like an included app and is really intuitive. If there were notifications I could drop official twitter app completely. But as I read twitter on demand, I don't rely on them anyway...</review_text>

      <review_title>Just one problem</review_title>
      <review_text>I love the ics ui but one major problem: when you type @ to tweet it doesn't pull up people's names to click on which is necessary so I don't have to remember their name or search</review_text>

      <review_title>Good but could use update</review_title>
      <review_text>Besides the obvious (no notifications) you also can't delete tweets that you posted using this app. Even when you go to the main Twitter site and delete that post, they still show up on this app. Hopefully the developer makes an update soon.</review_text>

      <review_title>Development has stalled</review_title>
      <review_text>Still my only twitter client, however development has all but halted. Developer has moved on to a new project (one that I think is far less beneficial) and stated he won't update this app until his launcher app is released. There will be several maintenance updates before he returns to tweet lanes, so don't fall in love with this app. I did and I refuse to change, but I am now having a sub par experience.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great app but lacking key features</review_title>
      <review_text>Once I got my ICS on my Bionic I quickly installed this app based on reviews and recommendation from some friends. After trying it out for a week or so, I like it a lot. I would have given a few more star_ratings but the lack of some key features dropped it to 3. Features not in this app I find useful in other twitter clients 1. Notifications 2. Edit Profile 3. Change where you can post vids/pics 4. Add/Modify lists - move ppl around or create new ones Once these are updated, I'm sure this will be a rockstar_rating application.</review_text>

      <review_text>Have been using this client since its early inception and love it for the most part but the recent lack of updates and remaining issues have forced me back to the official twitter client. Performance has just fallen right off with this app, it can no longer scroll without stuttering or even change lanes without a harsh visible delay. 3 star_ratings for original idea but the performance and support just isn't there at the moment. If/when things change I'll be back to this client.</review_text>

      <review_text>I have tried almost all the Android twitter apps but I like this one the best but it's sluggish compared to the others. With a few more fearures (ex. push notifications), a speed boost, more user customization options, I will rate it 5 star_ratings.</review_text>

      <review_text>No bloatware, does exactly what it says on the tin. Brill. Those complaining about notifications, blame the Twitter API you need to be part of their special club to get that feature ;)</review_text>

      <review_text>Forget touching all those buttons on your other Twitter apps. Watch this app flow through all your different Twitter functions by swiping through all your feeds! While not fully customisable, this is well worth the download (it's free, of course!), the interface is brilliant and really beats all the others out there. Thanks!</review_text>

      <review_title>Slow updates and lack of basic features.</review_title>
      <review_text>Okay, so this app is officially a dud for me. Dev doesn't add basic functionality like nick auto complete or notifications and is more interested in running his blog. His philosophy is that beautiful UI is more important than functionality, like the Apple crowd wants. Don't use this stupid app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Good client</review_title>
      <review_text>Some minor UI flaws (in my opinion) keep this from getting 5 star_ratings from me. 1. The delete all text in the text box time bomb needs to be removed. It is far to easy to hit when placing a text cursor there. 2. I think that touching a tweet should select, and bring up the contextual icons. I find that these are the actions I perform most, and having to constantly long press to reply our retweet is painful.</review_text>

      <review_text>I really like this app and it's now my daily driver. I love the unique layout. It is fast scrolling and easy to get around. I also appreciate the clean font and themes. I've been a fan of Seesmic fan for years, but am looking for a replacement since Hootsuite recently bought them out. Once Tweet Lanes allows saved searches, notifications, simultaneous posting to multiple accounts, and perhaps posting to facebook - I'll delete my Seesmic app and move over full time. A scheduled tweet function would also be fantastic.</review_text>

      <review_text>I love this app. It is really clean. However, it lacks a mute/zip function to hide tweets of people you follow without unfollowing them. It also lacks a column for trending topics.

      <review_text>Why is Tweet Lanes now running regardless of me having the app open? How do I disable this notification service. It's irritating. Switching to Carbon as soon as it's released. This shady service is not cool.</review_text>

      <review_title>Was 4-star_ratings but now 3. Why? TweetSpotlight</review_title>
      <review_text>The UI is very clean and well thought out. It's the best Twitter client I've found so far for handling Twitter lists. I really enjoyed it when I first tried it out. However I tend to read through my timeline quickly and add articles to Pocket for reading later. In Seesmic, I could just long-press on a link and immediately send to Pocket. With TweetLanes, it took 2 clicks but I could deal. But with the newest update and a new screen called TweetSpotlight, I need to long-press (for what seems like a really long time) in order to see the Share option. And sometimes the long-press doesn't fire and I have to retry. It's irksome and perhaps a deal breaker.</review_text>

      <review_text>Remembering place in the timeline doesn't always work and it never updates for new icons and such. Love the app though... and Chris Lacy is cuute! Let me delete, please. Autocorrect is ruining my tweets and then I have to open up chrome to delete.</review_text>

      <review_text>Great Twitter Client. I speak for a lot of people when I say that this app needs to show new followers and who favorited our tweets. That'll make this app complete. Great Job!!! :) nd themes nd also the new tweet spotlight kinda kills the whole objective of quick reply.. Seemed better when you touch on the tweet nd just reply without having to open the tweet to reply.</review_text>

      <review_text>It's certainly not perfect (it is a work in progress right now, after all...) but it doesn't deserve less than four star_ratings either because the developer is actively working on this and it will be perfect when it's done. There are a few features I'd like to see implemented but I'm sure they will be shortly. Will change my review when this app is complete!</review_text>

      <review_text>It's a beautiful app and it has cool and unique features that other Twitter clients don't have. However, some basic features are missing. It needs more settings, a lot more (esp. refresh and column settings). Notifications are definitely needed. Also, I'd love to have icon headers for the columns.

      <review_text>Needs: - Push notifications - Smoother scrolling - Trends - Auto-complete tagging - Ability to see responses to other people's Tweets - How many RTs and Favourites a Tweet has Then I'd use this app over the default application!</review_text>

      <review_text>This is a great twitter client, but it needs a little work before it'll be the only one on my phone. It needs notifications, save links to pocket /instapaper, and sync with tweet marker.</review_text>

      <review_text>Love the app's clean look, and I would really use it as my default Twitter client if only it had a few more features that I need (especially notifications!!!). Uninstalling for now, but I will be reinstalling for sure once it improves. Till then!</review_text>

      <review_text>can't wait for the app to reach 1.0 version. Got great potential. Well thought out &amp; designed perfectly. two major shortcomings so far, 1. doesn't maintain position, too buggy and unreliable 2. sharing window has design flaw. it open the actual app and causes to lose tweet postion</review_text>

      <review_text>User interface is beautiful: finally a proper Android Twitter client that uses Holo Light and Holo Dark themes. My user experience with this app is ten fold that of the stock Twitter app. The context tweet menu is genius as is scrolling via the volume buttons. The only thing this app needs is a the ability to configure the refresh speed but I'm sure the developer is working on that. Seriously great app!</review_text>

      <review_text>Really clean interface, scrolling down timeline with volume buttons is intuitive. This is one of those rare Twitter apps which let's you zoom in on photos! I can't say I'm a huge fan of the icon, just because of its size, but I'll admit the feet/lanes is rather clever. You can attach photos but GPS tagging hasn't yet been added. Also, I've done the 'Free for Life' thing and it said it was successful but now the option has come back? Will I still get the upcoming features?</review_text>

      <review_text>Not only is it functional, it is also beautifully designed. The app gets things done quicker than the Twitter-app by Twitter INC. itself. Way quicker. Also, the developer's interaction with the users through his Twitter-account is simply amazing! It gives you the feeling that your opinion actually matters to him, and he actually listens to what people request the most. I only had to subtract one star_rating, with pain in my heart though, because it is not fully featured. But if you love the Holo-theme and want something that completely differs from any other Twitter-client known to man, you have to try this one. You won't regret it.</review_text>

      <review_title>My fav twitter app</review_title>
      <review_text>I really like it. Was a bit sceptical and thought it would take something really special to beat Scope. But it has. I like: clarity; photo/video preview; and lanes. Nice. Still needs work but then it is still at early stages of development and you should expect that. Download. You'll not regret it.</review_text>

      <review_title>I love it but...</review_title>
      <review_text>I love the look and feel of the app. I also love that I can quickly swipe to my following list. I can deal with the lack of a widget, but the app needs to at least be able to act as default for twitter links. Add that to the next update and this will be my new daily driver.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great Twitter app missing two key features</review_title>
      <review_text>This is very well designed Twitter app but it's missing two very key features: 1. The ability to auto-populate user names as you begin typing. 2. It only stores Tweets in cache from the last update. So if you use an underground subway or don't have service for part of your commute, you won't be able to ready your full Twitter history, only the Tweets since your last refresh. Add these two features and my 3 star_ratings becomes 5 star_ratings without question.</review_text>

      <review_text>Transitions from Page to Page are smooth and fluent while not all the profile pics load right away (even though I'm on wifi) it's still impressive. Easy to respond to tweets and pull to reload is great! Would like an interactive widget for quick access as long as it has set intervals for when to reload feed (welcome to tiered data) other than that. No complaints and keep up the good work.

      <review_title>Nice, but needs work.</review_title>
      <review_text>There is no home screen widged. That is a big minus. Also, it's a bit laggy scrolling through the tweets. All and all, you should download it, worth checking out.</review_text>

      <review_text>I downloaded this app as soon as it hit the play store. With every update it improves, bringing new features. The developer churns the updates out at incredible speed and keeps you updated via his Twitter profile (@chrismlacy). If only more developers took as much pride in their work as Chris Lacy. Highly recommended even in its beta state.</review_text>

      <review_text>It's great to finally see a holo-styled Twitter app that works so well. Simple, intuitive and fits in amazingly with the rest of the Android OS. Only 4 star_ratings due to lack of proper tablet support, but would be more than happy to give 5 star_ratings if it appears in an update.</review_text>

Only 1 gripe please can there be an easy way for saving pictures without going to browser then this app will score 5 out of 5 for me. Keep up the good work :)</review_text>

      <review_title>Absolutely awesome, and rapidly becoming better</review_title>
      <review_text>With each new update, Tweet Lanes gets better and better, and as a result comes closer and closer to being my main Twitter app to replace Plume. Literally all I'm waiting for now is Tablet support and notifications. Beautifully follows Android ICS guidelines, and I'm loving the Context Tweet Box and the ability to select multiple accounts for replying/blocking/favoriting. The Holo Dark theme is also very nice and it even blends in with the Gnex's Navbar and bezel. Easily the best Twitter app for ICS phones out there, possibly even the best Twitter app, period.</review_text>

      <review_title>Very impressive!</review_title>
      <review_text>Long time Tweetcaster user. Just star_ratingted using this app a few days ago after reading a blog review. I reeeaally like it. Love the ui and the smooth ics/jb look of it. A few things missing (especially notification) but I'm gonna stick with it and give the developer some time to improve this already impressive app. Then... 5 star_ratings for sure!</review_text>

      <review_title>Great App, But Still Needs Improvements</review_title>
      <review_text>This app shows a lot of promise but there are many areas in which improvement is needed. Scrolling is choppy and when you view a tweet with several links it is hard to click on the one you want. There should be an option to choose the link you want like in Plume or my favorite Twitter client Twicca, which this app reminds me of. On the plus side, this app is beautiful and I love the constant text box at the bottom, which enables quick review_texting. I also enjoy the Jellybean look. Profile pages are also beautiful. Please keep up the good work. This is a wonderful app.</review_text>

      <review_text>Hands down the best twitter app. Dev is super responsive to user feedback and even gives his followers early access to beta builds. Performance is still a little clunky even on my Galaxy S3 but other than that this app has no competition. New features being added all the time and the developer does a great job of keeping users up to date on current progress and what's coming in the next release.</review_text>

      <review_text>keep me from giving this higher. I would love to see FB integration, but that's not the deal breaker. The deal breaker is the lack of notifications. I keep my Twitter app on all the time and it notifies me of my DMs and mentions. I like having a notification so I don't have to think about checking it. I know if it tweets that's what I've got waiting on me. I'll keep it for now. But I don't see it being my daily driver YET...</review_text>

      <review_text>twitter app. The reason i only gives it 4 star_ratings is becouse it misses a few futures like Zoom on picures, the ability to see what persons other are following,notifications and some more. But besides that it is a fantastic app.Edit. I am almost ready to give this app 5 star_ratings, but i still miss one future: The ability to see Who many and Who has retweeted a tweet.</review_text>

Also, when I want to share a tweet with a link, I would like that the Share Text in Tweet option doesn't change a link's text url to the actual url. I would hope it would keep the tweet text verbatim. Please fix? Great work team!</review_text>

      <review_text>without notifications it's not going to be my client of choice. Yes, it looks good (with the exception of the icon) but basic features are lacking.</review_text>

      <review_text>I've used every app available on the Play Store and I can say without a doubt this is my favorite. Do yourself a favor and try it. Great layout and features so far, and only getting better. Awesome developer behind it who is working hard and pushing out very quick updates. Just download the native Twitter app for push notifications for the time being and you are golden.</review_text>

      <review_text>I do believe I'll be ditching the native Twitter app for this one. Have only played around with it for a few minutes, but I'm loving it so far. The context-based tweet composition is great, and swiping between categories (aka. personal, lists, etc.) is great. It's not exactly buttery smooth on my GNex running 4.1.1, but nothing debilitating. Great job so far; looking forward to future dev's.</review_text>

      <review_text>This app is by far the best choice for Twitter on Android. The design is simple yet elegant. It's a fast, easy to use app, that blends in perfectly with the design of ICS. Chris is amazing at putting out updates in rapid fashion to fix bugs (what little there are) and to add features that those who follow him on Twitter suggest. Can't praise enough.</review_text>

      <review_text>No notifications No lane customization Limited settings Hard to hit links By far the BEST Twitter client out there. The only one to effectively use lists!

      <review_text>Overall the app and design is well thought out. Good use of the design guidelines. The slightly different usage pattern for replying works nicely. Would be nice to see push notifications (twitter is slow at granting developers that though). Having the app handle twitter URLs and contact sync would also be nice.</review_text>

      <review_title>Finally, a decent client!</review_title>
      <review_text>Tweetlanes has the honor of being the first decent android client out there. Whether it can withstand the threat of the impending Carbon for Android remains to be seen. Nevertheless this is some great work and should be celebrated. Developer is fast and responsive to review_texts, and pushes out updates really quickly. Client is elegant and beautiful and for a beta, already works very well. Some problems with clicking on links especially, but I'm sure that will be tweaked over time.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great Client!</review_title>
      <review_text>I really really Luke this Twitter client! Some things I have to say though: make it so that we can see who favorite/retweeted our tweets. Also, would it be possible to shoe trending topics? Other than those, I really like this app!</review_text>

      <review_title>Great app, quick updates, wish for more features</review_title>
      <review_text>This app is great and gets updated rather quickly. There are still some features I wish to see, such as: -Filtering of hash tags/words -Ability to refresh timeline without automatically jumping to top (refresh from current position) -Smaller New Tweet notification in the app. Big blue banner is sort of annoying -DMs -Notification settings One other issue that still sometimes happens is the user image/avatar is slow to load for some people I follow. Overall, this app seems to get better with each release, and I can't wait to see what the next release entails.</review_text>

      <review_title>Excellent new Twitter client</review_title>
      <review_text>Fast Twitter client, super clean design and fits in perfectly with ICS. Swiping left/right for lists, mentions, etc. is nice too. Image preview for major sites, like Instagram, is also handy. The official Twitter client needs a built in image viewer for links such as those. However, if you have a lot of lists, continuously swiping off to the right could become tiresome. The ability to add those I'm following to a list would also be welcome. Great work so far. Can't wait to see where you take this.</review_text>

      <review_text>So far the best android twitter app i've used. Love the native look &amp; feel, and it has a whole lot less bugs than Boid for example. It's very fast and smooth. My only piece of feedback would be the icon. It's not the best looking imo.</review_text>

      <review_text>Looks amazing! And the interface is really smooth! In future updates can you please put a notification feature and also a highlight feature so whenever I get mentioned it shows up on my time line. So far, it looks great and I'm on this app 100%! Keep up the great work and make this the #1 twitter replacement app!</review_text>

      <review_title>Good, but needs a lot more time</review_title>
      <review_text>Ui looks great, its fast and smooth and the UI philosophy wins me over, I think the omni tweet bar is what most twitter clients are missing. HOWEVER, this thing is still FAR too buggy and incomplete to be taken seriously, even as a beta. It wouldn't even let me finishing composing a tweet, kept taking focus away from the tweet bar. I'll check in later when its had the chance to mature functionally</review_text>

      <review_title>Awesome</review_title>
      <review_text>This is a fantastic Twitter client. Probably the best ICS styled app so far. It could definitely use a dark theme (for power savings,) as well as some performance improvements when it comes to scrolling and image loading, but other than that, I have no issues using this app as a full time replacement. Bravo.</review_text>

      <review_text>Take that tapbot (iphone)! I've been looking for an Android client that is functional and nice to look at. This is where my search stops. Forget the others, this is the best. As others have stated, I'd like to see a trending list of some sort. Other than that, it's a great app. By the way, in case you are wondering I'm running a rooted HTC One S with Android 4.0.4.</review_text>

      <review_text>Tweet Lanes is great. It fits into the design language on Ice Cream Sandwich very well, it mimics the design that other Google-y apps uses. Everything is very clean and simple. The app provides a great walkthrough-tutorial explaining how it is different from other apps. The navigation is simple, swipe in the timeline and swipe left and right to get various other panes. Great app.</review_text>

      <review_title>Best looking/acting Twitter client, but...</review_title>
      <review_text>This app is obviously still young and many features have yet to be implemented, but I find myself using TL more then other clients. Once this app reaches maturity it'll be amazing. please don't stop dev, I want to give you 5 star_ratings! Feature Request: Post to facebook as well as twitter. Then I can just get rid of Tweetdeck on my phone.</review_text>

      <review_text>Still needs features like username predictions, a following and followers tab for all users not only personal account, and more (I would love to see a widget as well). Overall a very good star_ratingt and only Twitter app I trust besides the official app.</review_text>

      <review_text>I do like the new approach to the composition of tweets etc. The UI is tidy and we'll made. Just 3 things: dark theme, copy-paste in compose box not working &amp; drafting (not sure it's available?). Great thus far though!</review_text>

      <review_title>This app has potential!</review_title>
      <review_text>I needed to find a new Twitter client because I was tired of not being able to quote tweets on the official app. I chose this one because it was 1) Ad Free, 2) In active development and 3) Rocking a proper ICS style. I'm reserving my final star_rating because it's obviously not feature-complete yet, but I am definitely going to give this a go as my primary client. BTW: previews from Instagram and Imgur are a big plus!</review_text>

      <review_text>After working out that I was too impatient to determine how to follow someone, I have to agree with Jackson that there needs to be a contextual list of ppl you follow/follow you when you type the @ symbol. Apart from that this is a solid little app with a flourish of updates so soon :)</review_text>

      <review_text>The absolute 鈥渕ust add鈥? feature you need to add next, would be to remember our place in the timeline while refreshing/updating. Also, while swiping to the right of the tweet, it would be great to have the app slide in a screen with all replies to that particular tweet.</review_text>

      <review_text>Really really like the context tweet bar and tap tweets to multireply it's genius!!! Not quite 5 star_ratings yet but if there was an option to have the mentions lists etc at the bottom instead of the top it would definitely be 5 star_ratings!</review_text>

      <review_text>The stock twitter app has always been my go to because it just works and works well. This app is GREAT and loaded with features. Patiently awaiting the widget though. How about a way to view conversations too? Probably the only things that are missing right now.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great Potential</review_title>
      <review_text>I really like the direction this app is going, especially with the picture previews. However some things still feel kinda wonky. As a slide out QWERTY user the lack of landscape support is a bit jarring and posting pictures seems to be broken too (at least for me). This app is still in it's early stages, and while I'm not ready to make this my dedicated Twitter client I can see it becoming that as it progresses, and I intend to keep testing it as it does so.</review_text>

      <review_title>Good but could be better.</review_title>
      <review_text>While the concept of the context button to streamline and unify twitter actions is a good idea, You should also add landscape rotation option to the default portrait for those of us who use this app in a tablet besides phones. another good option would be to be able to highlight an account and get context menu like add to search or go to tweets instead of having to go to the following tab and then having to click n the picture to be taken to the respective account.</review_text>

      <review_title>Best design of any current Twitter app</review_title>
      <review_text>This is really a great look and feel. It's ICS clear, navigation is buttery and it feels like this could be Android's answer to iPhone's Tweetbot. Great star_ratingt, hopefully Twitter doesn't destroy the API's for 3rd parties but let's hope for the best. Future suggestions: Tweetmarker, landscape keyboard, drafts, Readability/Pocket/Instapaper support within the TL, add/remove users from lists, perhaps a mobilized (Readability/Instapaper) version of a link just to name a couple. Some of those I'm sure are already on deck but still worth mentioning.</review_text>

      <review_text>I love the new features like multiple replies, VolNav, the everpresent tweet dialog, and the overall layout is great! However, it FC'd when expanding a conversation from the MyTweets tab, also we should be able to rearrange the tabs layout (order them/ remove some), let us change the font size to, it's huge! Keep up the great job, but for now, uninstalled :)</review_text>

      <review_text>It would be good if the apps got the ability to remember the last position of the timeline it was last browsed.. so users can just scroll upwards to the latest tweet in the timeline.. and the ability to resize text would be helpful..</review_text>

      <review_text>If the dev keeps up their work it'll be the best twitter app out there. Suggested Upgrades: -@Mention and Direct Message Notifications -160+ character tweets shortened and URL added to tweet to read longer tweets (similar to tweetdeck) ---- -Create Columns (similar to tweetdeck) -Dark Holo theme -Share tweets -Save to Pocket</review_text>

      <review_text>clean ui, innovative new tweet system! but need to add tweet feature caching because the app need to reload all tweets (which waste time considerably). keep up the good work! p.s. : the orange thingy is very attractive on my home screen icon oh, and a black themed UI could save my eyes on dark environtment :))</review_text>

      <review_title>Good star_ratingt, features missing.</review_title>
      <review_text>Good star_ratingt, it's not the first ICS style twitter app, but it does it the best out of the lot, not quite ready to be a daily driver though, few key features are missing: No log out option? Layout of the the drop down at the top doesn't display too well - big margins? Icon isn't too great. Custom font size - I want to see more tweets without scrolling. Landscape mode? - or at least for when composing a new tweet, for a bigger keyboard? Better tablet support - Columns in a landscape mode would be nice. Widget Dark theme Muting Good points: Introduction slides where good, friendly and well done. ICS design executed perfectly - big plus! Unique features that make sense. Everything that works, seems to work well. Looking forward to seeing what comes of this, if these problems get fixed quick, I can see it becoming the top twitter client of choice :)</review_text>

      <review_title>Could finally replace tweetdeck for me</review_title>
      <review_text>This seems like a great star_ratingt so far, with an obviously still in development app. I've been looking for something clean and simple to replace tweetdeck for awhile, but nothing exists out there where I can use multiple accounts, choose columns, and not look completely terrible. I really think this might end up being it, since the visual style is great, the lanes are essentially like tweetdeck columns, and it has multiple account support. A killer feature going forwards would be allowing mixed lanes with the multiple account support instead of having to context switch the app between accounts. That, and the ability to pick which account to tweet FROM on the fly are the features that keep me going back to tweetdeck, so I'd love to see them in a slick app like this one.</review_text>

      <review_text>Definitely my daily twitter app. Can't wait to see the new features as they are implemented. Even with some missing features it is the best twitter app for me. Only thing currently missing is the ability to resume the app at the point in your timeline you were at before refreshing or resuming the app. Keep up the great work!</review_text>

      <review_text>It could use dark theme version. I read twits before sleep, white background is very harsh on the eyes in dark room. Option to change text size would be great too. While I can read 1/3 on the current size with ease, my kid has very poor eye sight. Allowing at least few size options would be great. Regardless, I love the app and the design, and I'm certainly moving from TweetDeck in favor to TweetLanes. Looking forward to more features.</review_text>

      <review_title>Great early star_ratingt - interface looks ICSdelicious</review_title>
      <review_text>Great early star_ratingt - here's my positives, followed by a wishlist for features: Positives: Super fast, nice switching mechanism, love the multiple select options, love the quick access to lists and favourites (something the stock official app makes hard to find), beautiful ICS official look to it all, love the inline images + vid options. Bonus: hasn't crashed or stalled once yet even with heavy use and fast screen switching etc, with one exception (see below) Wishlist/review_texts: Can't figure out how to view a conversation (@ reply flow), can't figure out how to add an image or vid to a tweet, would like to see the android ICS dark theme as well as the stock light theme, Didn't like app icon being put on my screen automatically (I have that disabled - how did the app get around it?), needs Settings available soon for img hosting options, notifications, all the usual stuff. When sending img from gallery, it just goes to a black screen, so a bug or something (pulling img from google cloud); also, would like landscape view (split screen maybe?)</review_text>

      <review_text>App is amazing, unfortunately it's missing one essential feature i can't use a twitter client without, real-time notifications, Twitter doesn't provide the API's but some developers made real-time notifications themselves. So until we see some kind of real-time notifications it's a 4 but amazing nevertheless</review_text>

      <review_title>Nice UI. Intelligent ideas brought to the table</review_title>
      <review_text>The Dev has certainly put a lot of thought into how you actually USE Twitter, and it shows. Lots of smart ways of doing things. Version 0.1.9: I kept hitting This feature is not quite ready! warnings, so there are definitely some missing features. You can't even get into the settings! I'm sure this will be a very straing app by version 1.0</review_text>

        <sentence_text>Great early star_ratingt - here's my positives, followed by a wishlist for features: Positives: Super fast, nice switching mechanism, love the multiple select options, love the quick access to lists and favourites (something the stock official app makes hard to find), beautiful ICS official look to it all, love the inline images + vid options</sentence_text>

        <sentence_text>I wasn't impressed with this app at all it took entirely too long for my timeline mentions refreshing my page etc to pop up which makes this app useless to me I have to say this is the worst Twitter app I've tried so far the best I've tried was tweetcaster far as design its perfect an easy to use but it also has its problems but despite its problems it still beats out the rest of them if they ever fix those problems like lagging don't always show RTS etc tweetcaster would be by far the best Twitter app ever</sentence_text>
