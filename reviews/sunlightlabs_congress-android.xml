            <review_text>This is a really nicely done app. I look forward to digging into it and making the most of it. Sunlight Foundation is a terrific organization and I encourage everyone to support their work. They are indispensable for a citizen of the US.</review_text>

            <review_text>An increasingly valuable resource in an age of increasingly dubious information sources. You can look up any bill and subscribe to its progress - including where/how it was introduced, voting history (including who voted for it). You can even subscribe to its progress and receive up-to-the-minute notifications/updates of it. You can also look up any member of congress, find their district, their contact information, and the bills they have sponsored and who voted for them.</review_text>

            <review_text>Great app, but heard from devs that they are no longer supporting. Would be so much more useful if the blue follow star was next to the names in the vote record. Hopefully someone uses the open source to make a new app.</review_text>

            <review_text>If you dont have this app, how do you vote? Even keeps track of districts maps so you can follow the gerrymandering conversations. Allows me to see what politicians are doing during times of social crisis. This app makes you less mainstream media friendly tho.... plenty of true information here.</review_text>

            <review_text>The app's functionality and usefulness is great, but it often crashes when returning to the app after opening a pdf. Also, it would be great if there were three ability to click and follow to referenced and modified documents etc. So that when a bill only changes three lines, users may click to gain context for those edits, additions, addendums, and such without having to leave the app. Thank you! Awesome work.</review_text>

I'm so bummed. Sunlight Foundation is still hanging in there, though, if anybody wants to throw a few dollars their way. Really good non-profit committed to government transparency.</review_text>

            <review_title>Good, but incomplete</review_title>
            <review_text>The app works well, but it could use some more features. I'd love to see a feature that shows popular/ especially important bills. These could be selected by views from app users, mentions in news articles online, or even handpicked by the developers. This is a great concept, but it currently isn't convenient for casual users who want a more succint summary of Congress.</review_text>

            <review_text>My only complain is that it won't stay in the same menu that I want it to stay in.

Perhaps there could be a fix for that in the near future?</review_text>
