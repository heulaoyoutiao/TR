            <review_title>Finally An App!</review_title>
            <review_text>The app has an easy format similar to FRC Spyder that makes it user friendly and something I can use to search up a team quickly with easy access to data from all years. Selecting an event the team when to through their page is great since it goes straight to that team's info. Having team media in its own separate tab is great as well. The only thing I could suggest is to make a favorites or history option to keep to have a record of what teams I have been looking at.</review_text>
